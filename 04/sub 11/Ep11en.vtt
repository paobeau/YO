WEBVTT

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:52.045
"Love is All"

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:55.328
"Episode 11"

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.049
"Entrance to gold mine,
jealousy of Tang Tian Yuan"

00:01:58.339 --> 00:02:00.579
We have both the evidence
and the witnesses.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.781
He is trying to cut off our lead.

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.738
Before Sang Jie handed in the report,

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.259
someone had already taken
all the evidences.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.931
So this is why you hide
everything in here.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.219
Zong Ying Lin sent his men
to steal from us.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.534
That means he doesn't know
if there were any evidences left.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.578
Which also proves he doesn't know
where the gold is.

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:20.699
I will order Da Wang and Xiao Liu
to go on patrol.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.899
Check the perimeter more often.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.979
They can handle thugs
and hooligans fairly easily.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.765
But if our enemy comes prepared,

00:02:27.866 --> 00:02:29.768
they might lost their lives
in the fight.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.389
We should prioritize
the safety of our people, darling.

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:35.114
What did you say?

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:37.811
What did I say?

00:02:38.615 --> 00:02:41.742
You just said "darling" at the end.

00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:44.761
No, I didn't.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.280
Yes, you did! You couldn't help it.

00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:53.410
This is the first sign
of falling in love.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.882
Sir!

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.670
Sir.

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:59.738
Since our first two love experiments
resulted in huge success,

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:01.800
I think we are ready to start
the third experiment.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:04.279
What experiments? Don't be absurd.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.710
I don't remember doing
any love experiment.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.500
It's all inside the novels.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.578
Love will make someone
get carried away.

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:11.059
It's like walking on a cloud.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.738
Yes, every time
I am seeing Miss Ru Yi,

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.610
I felt like I am walking in the air.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.177
-Really?
-Really!

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.458
It's only because you know parkour.
This has no scientific proof.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:22.098
Everyone is different.

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:23.538
You can't generalize...

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.139
everyone's love life
into one principle.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.458
But all the love poetry has been
writing about it for centuries.

00:03:28.911 --> 00:03:30.332
This is how falling in love should be.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.486
Everyone does it, but not me.

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.569
But can't you do it for me?

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:39.588
For you?

00:03:46.416 --> 00:03:47.544
I am done with you.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.698
But she was right.

00:03:57.383 --> 00:03:59.111
Don't be so full of yourself.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.627
Don't be ridiculous.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.393
Miss Ru Yi.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.162
Boss.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.237
What happened?

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:16.895
My business is ruined.

00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:19.256
My bride is in love with another man.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.122
Boss, I am sorry.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.160
It was my fault.

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:27.233
Humans are not invincible.
Everyone gets sick sometimes.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.300
You may take my salary this month...

00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.367
as the compensation for your damage.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.601
Don't worry about it.

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:34.847
I am not short on money anyway.

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:40.256
Miss Ru Yi.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.256
May I ask you a question?

00:04:42.783 --> 00:04:43.854
What is it?

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.251
Do girls not have any sentiment
for their past love?

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:53.325
Me and my bride met first.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.904
We grew up together.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.999
Even in relationship,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.007
first come first served.

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:01.245
Am I right?

00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:04.539
We can't be certain
when it comes to love.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.026
There is no reasoning.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.371
As long as you do your best,

00:05:08.472 --> 00:05:09.905
as long as you won't regret it.

00:05:11.423 --> 00:05:12.520
You are right.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.111
I must do my best.

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.306
My bride must have been
beguiled by Tang Fei Long.

00:05:22.359 --> 00:05:25.349
She will regret not picking me
as her lover.

00:05:27.174 --> 00:05:28.407
Regret all she wants.

00:05:34.606 --> 00:05:36.775
But shouldn't I remind her
of the option available?

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:38.211
Miss Ru Yi.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.302
Will you do me a favour?

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.170
Miss Ru Yi.
You have an good eye for this.

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.248
Help me pick a present for my bride.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.258
I want Tang Fei Long to see...

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:51.760
I can afford a gift
beyond his imagination.

00:05:52.022 --> 00:05:54.747
Gold and jade together.
It looks very high-end, right?

00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:56.302
I hand-picked it.

00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:58.155
This looks too out of fashion.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.250
This one.

00:06:04.957 --> 00:06:06.877
A hairpin made with ruby.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.619
It's one of the only two
in this world.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.779
The Empress has the other one.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.160
And now I have this.

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:15.320
This is the reward...

00:06:15.421 --> 00:06:17.888
my father got when he helped
searching for Her Majesty's brother.

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.820
So has Her Majesty found her brother?

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:23.939
No. It wasn't so easy.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.258
It's been over ten years.

00:06:25.359 --> 00:06:29.574
It was said that Her Majesty was
travelling with her brother.

00:06:29.675 --> 00:06:32.087
The young boy went missing
when she wasn't paying attention.

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:34.186
Her Majesty's heart was broken.

00:06:34.287 --> 00:06:36.178
The Emperor felt sorry for her,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.200
so troops of soldiers were deployed
to search for the boy.

00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.499
The boy would have been found
either dead or alive.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.847
If they couldn't find him,

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:46.219
he is either dead...

00:06:46.357 --> 00:06:48.799
or someone is keeping him hidden.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.304
Who cares?
It's not like he was my brother.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.178
Speaking of brother,

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.983
my bride does have a younger brother.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.542
I should prepare a present
for him as well.

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:02.371
I need him to put up
a good word for me.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.488
Preceptor Tan has a brother as well?

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.840
Yes, she has a brother.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.487
But they are not related by blood.

00:07:13.984 --> 00:07:17.779
Yet they are as close as
a real family can get.

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:20.623
Think about it. My bride...

00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:22.837
ran away from our engagement...

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:24.872
but she insisted on
bringing him along.

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:31.959
Here. You should give her this.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.339
But...

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.214
But Miss Ru Yi,

00:07:39.315 --> 00:07:41.796
this present looks too petty.

00:07:42.458 --> 00:07:45.299
Preceptor Tan is different.
She doesn't like make-up.

00:07:45.519 --> 00:07:48.110
The more simple it is,
the better it suits her.

00:07:52.085 --> 00:07:55.009
Lady, I don't sell wine here.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.539
Please don't make it hard for me.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.790
You have distiller grains in there.
Give me two taels of it.

00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.166
But they are not wine.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.086
Preceptor Tan.

00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:07.698
Miss Ru Yi.

00:08:08.247 --> 00:08:09.517
Why are you here?

00:08:10.119 --> 00:08:11.424
I am here for some fresh air.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:14.289
Shouldn't you be at home right now?

00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:16.029
Why do you wish to have wine?

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.131
Did you have a fight with your lover?

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.472
-Of course not!
-All right.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.141
I am terribly sorry.
You should get some rest.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.435
One is stiff-minded
and one is stubborn.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.350
Even the deity of love would have
a hard time making you two a couple.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.953
Are you really my brother?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.058
No. From now on,

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.023
I will be Preceptor Tan's sister.

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.122
We were just acting.
Don't be so serious.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.998
I don't know about you,

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:47.562
but she is serious about it.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.509
How so?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.227
If she was just putting up an act,
she could have ask for my help.

00:08:55.479 --> 00:08:59.480
Yes, I am not as striking
as the handsome Tang Tian Yuan.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.975
But one could easily get
exposed for bad acting.

00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:03.731
She could have get herself...

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.462
a close friend that would
follow her plan.

00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:07.218
Why didn't she?

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:09.570
Because she couldn't help it.

00:09:10.159 --> 00:09:12.239
You are the first person
that comes to her mind.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.019
Little Dragon, don't you get it?

00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:26.382
<i>My goodness.</i>

00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:27.884
What is that thing?

00:09:27.985 --> 00:09:29.015
Today,

00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:31.655
I noticed the eye bags
under Ru Yi's eyes.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.400
I bet she hasn't been
sleeping well lately.

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:37.618
So I am making her a pouch.

00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.219
With some sandalwood
and Benjamin wood inside,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.469
it will improve quality of sleep.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.419
Why did you become such a sissy?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.857
Only girls make these for the men.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.179
A man must be capable of
great success...

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.772
and also learn to sew.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.378
A man should do anything for his girl.

00:09:54.479 --> 00:09:56.418
Unlike you who are a liar.

00:09:56.599 --> 00:09:58.686
You will only push her further
away from you.

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:15.568
This thing,

00:10:16.769 --> 00:10:17.897
is it easy to learn?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.074
Come.

00:10:20.239 --> 00:10:21.654
Tang Fei Long's wine cellar.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:23.951
It's right here.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.818
I don't think this is a good idea.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:28.961
Don't worry, I live here.

00:10:29.621 --> 00:10:31.823
But why did we come in
from the back door?

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:36.130
Well, it's not like we are
doing something decent.

00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:38.158
Forget it. We'll finish all his wine.

00:10:38.259 --> 00:10:39.555
You are my good friend,

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:40.887
we should drink together.

00:10:47.899 --> 00:10:50.392
He could bury it however he wants
and I will still find it.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.698
This is the Spring of Jade wine.

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:55.859
You would need dew from the morning...

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.566
and the spring water
deep within the mountain.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:00.949
And then the wine must be buried under
the peach tree for three months.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.527
Is that so?

00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:03.963
I don't care.

00:11:05.679 --> 00:11:08.014
What are you adding?

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.219
This is the bitter gourd juice I made.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.339
Even a single drop is bitter
to the bone.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.260
Tang Fei Long broke my heart,
I want some payback.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.596
Let me take a look.

00:11:19.287 --> 00:11:20.923
I should put more of this in it.

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:28.346
It's not bitter.

00:11:29.175 --> 00:11:30.672
Are you serious?

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.516
That means you are
used to bitterness in life.

00:11:34.051 --> 00:11:36.729
Miss Ru Yi, what's the matter?
Tell me, I can protect you.

00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:42.543
What if...

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:44.663
I mean what if...

00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:47.310
you set some rules with each other,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.472
while you don't follow all the rules,

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.508
the other breaks the rules,

00:11:53.976 --> 00:11:55.730
then he wants you to
do something you hate,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.991
what would you do?

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:00.432
Someone bullied you?

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:02.448
Who would bullied you?

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.419
Are they the thugs from
Miao Sheng Parlour?

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.880
-I should arrest them!
-No.

00:12:08.981 --> 00:12:10.536
It has nothing to do with them.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.550
Who was it then?

00:12:14.626 --> 00:12:17.578
Zheng Shao Feng! That jerk!

00:12:17.679 --> 00:12:18.733
No.

00:12:19.503 --> 00:12:20.624
So...

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.625
Forget it.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.252
I shouldn't have asked.

00:12:25.824 --> 00:12:28.925
Take it as we never
had this conversation.

00:12:31.225 --> 00:12:32.731
Are you sure you are all right?

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:35.881
I am fine.

00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:39.779
Sit.

00:12:50.991 --> 00:12:52.553
But I think...

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.482
rules are meant to be broken.

00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:57.018
People say a girl
can't be a Preceptor.

00:12:57.119 --> 00:12:58.447
They look down on dancers.

00:12:58.784 --> 00:13:00.305
Yet we are doing just fine in life.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.979
I think that as long as
my conscience is clear,

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.266
that I don't let my loved ones down,
it should be enough.

00:13:07.792 --> 00:13:09.880
I understand, thank you.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.768
Let me know if you needed help.
I will protect you.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.887
Let me help you.

00:13:20.687 --> 00:13:22.777
Stir this wine and
make it taste awful.

00:13:24.159 --> 00:13:26.018
Hold on, there is something
on your hair.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.505
It's all right.

00:13:30.231 --> 00:13:31.268
I got rid of it.

00:13:31.479 --> 00:13:32.548
Thank you.

00:13:36.359 --> 00:13:37.571
Commissioner Zheng!

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:40.299
Let's have some wine.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.758
You should have invited me sooner.

00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:43.899
Are we even friends now?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.218
Listen, I was just...

00:13:47.272 --> 00:13:48.354
Where did she go?

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:55.691
Sir.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:14:00.683
Servants from the Sun family reported
that bandits took their foods.

00:14:02.599 --> 00:14:03.861
When did that happen?

00:14:04.214 --> 00:14:05.359
Two nights ago.

00:14:06.119 --> 00:14:07.316
Two nights ago?

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.618
I was confused as well.

00:14:08.719 --> 00:14:10.937
I confirmed with them,
it really was two nights ago.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.576
Very well. Dismiss.

00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:18.925
What's wrong?

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.818
It took them two days
to report a robbery.

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:24.185
What is going on here?

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:25.741
It's simple.

00:14:25.842 --> 00:14:27.121
The things that were robbed...

00:14:27.222 --> 00:14:29.429
include both food supply and gold.

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:31.899
They are trying to bury
the evidence of hiding gold.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.258
With us getting rid of the bandits,

00:14:33.359 --> 00:14:35.218
they will get to retrieve the gold.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.559
They don't seem to be anxious.
Take our time with it.

00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:42.927
We can deal with this later.

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:46.248
But you need to be more cautious.

00:14:46.599 --> 00:14:48.439
Keep an eye on the Sun family.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:49.918
Sure, I will.

00:14:52.487 --> 00:14:54.295
Where are you going?

00:14:54.982 --> 00:14:56.314
To continue my acting.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.880
Preceptor Tan.

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.108
Our agreement doesn't forbid me
from taking my revenge.

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:29.588
I am sorry.

00:15:29.766 --> 00:15:30.881
Yesterday,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:33.139
I was out of line.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.949
What are you up to today? Master Tang?

00:15:38.498 --> 00:15:41.290
I only came up with that idea
to keep cover safe.

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:43.698
That wasn't entirely a bright idea,

00:15:44.248 --> 00:15:45.638
but I meant well.

00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:49.848
If apologies is any good,
the District Bureau would perish.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.539
-I have to go now.
-Listen,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.219
the Nu Er Hong they brew is...

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.859
-Heavenly!
-What?

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.899
-Really?
-I need to try that out sometimes.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.414
We'll talk somewhere more private.

00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:00.540
Where are you taking me?

00:16:01.479 --> 00:16:03.513
Get mad at me if you want,
apologize if that is your plan.

00:16:03.614 --> 00:16:04.938
Who do you think I am?

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:07.095
What can I do to make it up for you?

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:10.463
You are the Magistrate,
I wouldn't dare to oppose you.

00:16:11.719 --> 00:16:13.698
You really are petty.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:16.620
Not only that, I am also a fool.

00:16:17.847 --> 00:16:20.975
A fool who was silly enough
to have asked you for help.

00:16:21.832 --> 00:16:23.096
Forget it.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.698
You could have gone
to Zheng Shao Feng,

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:27.687
Da Wang or Xiao Liu.
Why did you choose me?

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.659
You couldn't help it so you chose me.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:31.914
Nonsense.

00:16:32.015 --> 00:16:34.339
It was an emergency,
it was a slip of a tongue.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.539
Was it though?

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:38.258
I bet you were trying to
make me yours.

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:39.712
I am done with you.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.152
Where did you get that?

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.593
Zhu Da Cong.

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:53.494
You can't just accept his gift.

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.334
Why can't I accept his gift?

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.587
After all, he is obsessed with me.

00:16:58.688 --> 00:17:01.303
This bracelet is worth
at least 100 taels of silver.

00:17:01.404 --> 00:17:02.561
I might as well take it.

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.191
You made the agreement yourself.

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:09.390
If the others found out
you accepted his gift,

00:17:10.064 --> 00:17:11.282
we would be in trouble.

00:17:14.738 --> 00:17:15.899
You shouldn't wear it.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.098
Why? Because you said so?

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:19.680
Just like why I am not allowed
in investigation?

00:17:19.781 --> 00:17:22.104
We are putting up an act,
don't get too immersed in it.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.959
Are you all right?

00:17:31.871 --> 00:17:32.890
A skull!

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:39.463
My goodness.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.064
He is dead.

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:50.144
There are others.

00:17:50.639 --> 00:17:53.740
There are so many corpses!

00:17:54.498 --> 00:17:56.098
Help! Save us!

00:17:56.199 --> 00:17:58.060
Stop shouting. Don't step on them.

00:17:58.599 --> 00:17:59.786
Stay behind me.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.618
Preceptor.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:28.293
There is a gold nugget.

00:18:29.463 --> 00:18:30.491
A gold nugget?

00:18:32.631 --> 00:18:34.097
It really is.

00:18:35.777 --> 00:18:37.145
That's enough to calm you down?

00:18:37.896 --> 00:18:40.248
Money can make anything possible.

00:18:40.873 --> 00:18:43.714
Gold gives me the courage.

00:18:43.939 --> 00:18:45.539
I think we might have accidentally...

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.842
found the entrance to
Sang Jie's gold mine.

00:18:48.218 --> 00:18:50.218
That means we are going to be rich.

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:51.817
There must be plenty of gold in here.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.613
You are unbelievable.

00:18:55.858 --> 00:18:56.978
Can't you see?

00:18:57.079 --> 00:18:59.023
The whole mine has been emptied.

00:18:59.124 --> 00:19:02.640
These dead people are loose ends
killed by Sang Jie himself.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.841
Master Zhang, here you are again.
Come in.

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:09.938
Commissioner Zheng.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.779
-Miss Ru Yi.
-Why don't you come inside?

00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:18.337
I made this pouch for you.

00:19:20.119 --> 00:19:21.491
This is a lovely bird.

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.089
That is mandarin duck.

00:19:26.199 --> 00:19:28.346
I put some Benjamin wood in there.

00:19:28.479 --> 00:19:30.777
Hang it by your bed and it should
improve your sleep quality.

00:19:32.415 --> 00:19:34.131
I knew I lost the needle somewhere.

00:19:34.655 --> 00:19:36.628
Let me take you to a doctor.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:37.929
I am fine.

00:19:38.199 --> 00:19:39.231
Let me do it.

00:19:41.016 --> 00:19:42.028
It's all right.

00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:44.872
My apology.

00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:51.951
However,

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:54.719
you have my thanks for this gift.

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:55.886
You are welcome.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:19:58.179
Don't you need to work today?

00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.587
No, let's go shopping.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:02.344
Commissioner Zheng!

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.339
Speaking of the devil.

00:20:06.599 --> 00:20:08.247
Where have you been?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.579
What's the matter?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.571
Master Tang and Preceptor Tan
left this morning.

00:20:12.679 --> 00:20:14.222
They haven't come back yet.

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:16.876
I am worried they might be in trouble.

00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:19.265
You are bossy like an old lady.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.539
They are madly in love.

00:20:21.784 --> 00:20:24.306
No. Master Tang ordered us...

00:20:24.407 --> 00:20:26.029
to prepare a surprise
for Preceptor Tan.

00:20:26.247 --> 00:20:27.848
But they haven't come back yet.

00:20:28.928 --> 00:20:30.311
A surprise?

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:36.458
Master Tang has always been
so attentive to Preceptor Tan.

00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:38.479
Something is off.

00:20:38.832 --> 00:20:41.593
Commissioner Zheng, work is priority.
You should go.

00:20:42.649 --> 00:20:44.116
Very well, Miss Ru Yi.

00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:45.778
I visit you some other day.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.932
Let's go.

00:20:56.352 --> 00:20:57.375
Use this.

00:20:59.584 --> 00:21:02.351
This is pretty. Can I have this?

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.763
You are not completely heartless.

00:21:08.138 --> 00:21:09.312
You said it,

00:21:09.413 --> 00:21:11.097
my acting should include
the full package.

00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:13.333
Since Zhu Da Cong sent you a gift,

00:21:13.439 --> 00:21:15.059
I should give you a present as well.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.517
Otherwise I would seem petty.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.734
You are so thoughtful.

00:21:23.911 --> 00:21:25.106
So...

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.002
do you forgive me?

00:21:30.744 --> 00:21:32.134
You can put it that way.

00:21:43.512 --> 00:21:44.632
A signal flare?

00:21:44.807 --> 00:21:46.264
Why didn't you use it earlier?

00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:48.549
I wanted to spend more time with you.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.674
Preceptor.

00:21:56.839 --> 00:21:57.912
Sir.

00:22:00.119 --> 00:22:01.236
Hurry up.

00:22:01.479 --> 00:22:02.577
Come on.

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.287
-Are you all right?
-Sir.

00:22:09.271 --> 00:22:10.468
What took you so long?

00:22:14.239 --> 00:22:16.297
Where is my bracelet?

00:22:16.703 --> 00:22:18.305
My one hundred taels are gone.

00:22:20.899 --> 00:22:22.338
-Go down there if you want.
-No.

00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:23.507
Go and get it.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.007
Forget it, just leave it.

00:22:27.513 --> 00:22:28.779
If you wanted to have a date,

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:30.880
you shouldn't have come
to this remote place.

00:22:31.268 --> 00:22:32.579
You two are troublemakers.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.378
Commissioner Zheng, there are a dozen
of bodies down there.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.008
I need you to carry them out
of there for me.

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:39.455
Let's go.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.719
But...

00:22:40.839 --> 00:22:42.076
Preceptor Tan!

00:22:44.239 --> 00:22:45.459
Little Dragon!

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.956
You are such an ingrate!

00:22:47.138 --> 00:22:48.335
I should have left you there!

00:22:48.436 --> 00:22:50.714
Sir, are those dead people really
the gold miners?

00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:52.258
Could the gold be in that cave?

00:22:52.359 --> 00:22:53.973
If the gold could be so easily found,

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.459
Zong Ying Lin would have found it.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.378
You do have a point.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.452
I pity those gold miners.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.469
Rabbit lanterns!

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:10.060
You made them?

00:23:10.161 --> 00:23:11.300
Don't take this wrongly.

00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:12.419
I made these...

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.685
just for show for the people
on this workplace.

00:23:15.719 --> 00:23:16.901
I get it.

00:23:17.002 --> 00:23:18.568
The full package.

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.927
What is this?

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.899
This is a nice little thing.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.284
Come, sit.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.938
Okay.

00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:48.357
Isn't that from the novel I wrote?

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.939
Yes.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.378
I read through your
whole book yesterday.

00:23:53.534 --> 00:23:54.740
I find that...

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.188
the stories are not entirely useless.

00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:58.659
Of course.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.299
I even have plans
for the second volume.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.858
I will use Sang Jie's gold mine
as the main storyline.

00:24:02.959 --> 00:24:04.975
I'll expose the corruption
within our ranks.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.895
And also that Zong Ying Lin.

00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:14.545
What's wrong?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.688
It's a beautiful night,
let's not talk about work.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.953
Are you out of your mind?

00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:30.802
Don't you remember our agreement?

00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:38.626
All this time,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.079
I've been hiding a secret from you.

00:24:44.777 --> 00:24:46.201
You are married?

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.076
My secret is...

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.023
the first time I met you that day...

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.174
is the moment...

00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.779
I fell in love with you.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.659
I scammed you for 100 taels of silver.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.542
I like the way you lied to me.

00:25:02.643 --> 00:25:05.268
You are not making any sense.
You are giving me goosebumps.

00:25:06.383 --> 00:25:07.885
Then I will say no more.

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:14.258
Tang Fei Long, I am warning you.

00:25:14.359 --> 00:25:15.722
You are violating the rules.

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:18.280
Someone is eavesdropping on us.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:20.824
Seriously?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.168
What not?

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.335
Make them disgusted.

00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:31.957
You...

00:25:39.725 --> 00:25:41.356
You are trying to
take advantage of me.

00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:43.590
Is there any better solution?

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.283
Fine, come on.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.610
Why are you hiding in the bush?

00:26:07.711 --> 00:26:08.758
Come out.

00:26:10.495 --> 00:26:12.160
-Sir.
-Preceptor.

00:26:13.959 --> 00:26:15.145
Sir.

00:26:15.941 --> 00:26:17.460
It's servant from the Sun family.

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.579
I know, bandits robbed them
of their food supply.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.365
They've come here so many times.

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:22.754
I know it.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.821
-No.
-It's not that.

00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:27.101
It's not about the food.

00:26:27.656 --> 00:26:29.587
Supernumerary Sun is dead.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.321
Supernumerary Sun is dead?

00:26:32.747 --> 00:26:34.555
"As long as you like it"

00:26:39.458 --> 00:26:42.299
Brothers, I need all the manpower
to search for his body!

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.150
-Move out!
-Yes!

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.328
Xiao Liu, hurry up.

00:26:55.902 --> 00:26:57.736
Preceptor, the body is not here.

00:26:58.199 --> 00:26:59.310
Keep searching.

00:27:10.199 --> 00:27:11.479
What was that for, Old Tang?

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.728
What are you doing here?

00:27:13.616 --> 00:27:14.691
I...

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.575
I am not slacking off.

00:27:18.568 --> 00:27:20.634
I am working on the case.

00:27:20.959 --> 00:27:22.102
A case?

00:27:23.939 --> 00:27:25.659
Do fish in this river tastes better...

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.300
or is our fish more delicious?

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:31.899
Preceptor Tan feeds the fish too much
now they are all bloated.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.893
The meat is hard and dry.

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:36.974
But the fish from this river...

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:40.235
is so lively and energetic.
I bet they are delicious.

00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:43.849
I knew you ate my pet fish!

00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:46.334
What was that for? It hurts.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.221
I did manage to catch something.

00:27:50.736 --> 00:27:52.024
Over there.

00:27:58.679 --> 00:27:59.679
So?

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:02.338
The servants from
Sun family told us...

00:28:02.439 --> 00:28:04.340
Supernumerary Sun jumped
into the river.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.065
The old man fish here every day.
He should have seen that.

00:28:08.199 --> 00:28:09.959
But we've been searching
for 24 hours.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:11.939
There is no way the fish could ...

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.278
eat the body clean so quickly.

00:28:13.599 --> 00:28:15.852
He lost his gold,

00:28:15.953 --> 00:28:17.673
but the report says
it's the food supply.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.807
And he waited before
he filed a report.

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.604
He must have panicked.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.622
A coward like that man...

00:28:25.482 --> 00:28:26.823
would never take his own life.

00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:30.907
Who do you think kill that man?

00:28:32.599 --> 00:28:35.252
I suspect it's the doing
of our old friend.

00:28:39.719 --> 00:28:41.534
Unless we find the man,

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:44.201
the words about the gold mine
could go out.

00:28:58.319 --> 00:28:59.645
What happened between you two?

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.066
Why is she ignoring you?

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.084
I kissed her.

00:29:05.199 --> 00:29:06.793
You kissed her?

00:29:13.726 --> 00:29:14.923
Where did you kiss?

00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:18.699
The head.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.863
Where specifically?

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:36.175
Tang Fei Long, oh Tang Fei Long.

00:29:36.439 --> 00:29:38.260
-Tang Fei Long oh.
-Sister.

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.593
Why are you in the kitchen?

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.976
You might burn the whole place down.

00:29:43.239 --> 00:29:45.419
I learned a few new recipes
from the cookbook.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:47.920
I am making something delicious
for Master Tang.

00:29:49.671 --> 00:29:51.084
Is this part of the acting?

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.013
You can put it that way.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.291
He caught a cold at
the riverside just now.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.778
So I am making him some tonic.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.820
But he didn't do that for you.

00:30:01.959 --> 00:30:04.378
Your acting with Master Tang
is getting to another level.

00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:05.498
Don't be silly.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:07.858
He forged a signature for me
just to help me out.

00:30:07.959 --> 00:30:09.539
He dealt with Zhu Da Cong for me.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.869
I need to thank him.

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.228
Have you found Supernumerary's body?

00:30:13.359 --> 00:30:16.191
We've been searching
the whole day and found nothing.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.741
Where is Zheng Shao Feng?

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.440
He is interrogating the servants
from Sun family.

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:22.858
Sir.

00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:24.942
You asked for us?

00:30:25.043 --> 00:30:27.539
I still need to collect taxes
from the southern area.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.059
-He is right.
-People dislike us for that.

00:30:30.207 --> 00:30:31.273
Save it for another day.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.898
Preceptor Tan is going to
treat you to a nice meal.

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.123
She knows how to cook?

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.840
I get it now.

00:30:44.359 --> 00:30:45.978
After you started
dating Preceptor Tan,

00:30:46.079 --> 00:30:47.552
she has become a housewife!

00:30:48.023 --> 00:30:49.363
She even learned how to cook.

00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:52.978
Sir, when you get married,

00:30:53.079 --> 00:30:55.259
be sure to hold a reception...

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.618
right here in Tongling.

00:30:56.719 --> 00:30:59.374
Invite all the people in town
to the reception.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.575
Sir, what's wrong?

00:31:04.199 --> 00:31:06.316
What about my relatives
back in the Capital?

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.218
We've been living here
for quite some time.

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:10.520
We should show some gratitude.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.659
You are right.
After living here for half a month,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.090
we've saved quite some money.

00:31:16.191 --> 00:31:17.273
Right?

00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:19.800
But the workroom has been rebuilt.

00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:21.098
We may go back anytime.

00:31:21.206 --> 00:31:22.707
Perhaps we should go home tomorrow.

00:31:24.624 --> 00:31:25.860
This is a little sudden.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.738
The paint would still be giving
out a stench.

00:31:30.839 --> 00:31:32.148
Maybe we should wait.

00:31:33.439 --> 00:31:35.533
You and Master Tang
are just putting up an act.

00:31:35.634 --> 00:31:38.192
People at the District Bureau
will find out sooner or later.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.695
Going back to the workroom
will buy us some time.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.290
You have a point.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:48.997
We'll be leaving tomorrow.

00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.365
Sister,

00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:54.700
Master Tang is a wise
and righteous officer.

00:31:55.439 --> 00:31:57.332
But forging a seal
of the Imperial Spokesman...

00:31:57.439 --> 00:31:58.809
could get him executed.

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:00.756
And he is playing along
with your plan.

00:32:00.857 --> 00:32:02.050
Why would he do that?

00:32:02.949 --> 00:32:05.309
Don't worry, he won't hurt me.

00:32:05.719 --> 00:32:07.059
I am not worry about him.

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.338
I am worried you are blindly putting
your trust in him.

00:32:09.439 --> 00:32:10.583
I don't trust him.

00:32:10.684 --> 00:32:12.647
Just leave the kitchen,
I have food to make.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.720
Fine, let me get you some water.
In case you burnt the place down.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.515
One last meal before I leave.

00:32:27.199 --> 00:32:28.293
Everyone,

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.558
since the day our workroom
was burnt down,

00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:33.598
I've been living here
for almost a month.

00:32:34.359 --> 00:32:36.059
And now, the workroom...

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.779
has been renovated.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.026
I should go back.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.564
In order to express my gratitude
for taking care of us,

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:47.916
I learned a few recipes
from the books...

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.845
so I could treat you to a meal.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.618
Eat heartily.

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:54.511
I assure you these are unlike
anything you've seen before.

00:32:54.698 --> 00:32:55.858
-Okay.
-Thank you, Preceptor.

00:32:55.959 --> 00:32:57.046
Thank you, Preceptor.

00:32:58.367 --> 00:32:59.446
You are going back?

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:04.035
My workroom is reopening tomorrow.

00:33:04.175 --> 00:33:05.775
I don't want to delay any work.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.120
Sir.

00:33:10.199 --> 00:33:12.819
Preceptor Tan will be here every day
for her work.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.569
You don't have to miss her so much.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:16.368
Don't miss me too much.

00:33:18.189 --> 00:33:21.101
Enjoy your meal.
This is my first attempt at cooking.

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:22.950
-Okay.
-I am digging in now.

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.603
Preceptor, what is this thing?

00:33:29.582 --> 00:33:31.011
Zhao Xiao Liu.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.880
I knew you are not very knowledgeable.

00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:38.082
This is steamed cane toad.

00:33:38.959 --> 00:33:40.052
It's delicious.

00:33:42.334 --> 00:33:43.484
Preceptor.

00:33:44.485 --> 00:33:45.915
Preceptor, is mine...

00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:48.880
Your is a tonic.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:51.913
A tonic.

00:33:52.239 --> 00:33:53.511
-Tonic?
-Check it out.

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.086
It's an eyeball!

00:33:58.079 --> 00:34:00.000
Preceptor, did you kill someone?

00:34:00.391 --> 00:34:01.560
Li Da Wang.

00:34:01.661 --> 00:34:05.452
It's a soup made with bull's eye,
pig's eye, fish's eye.

00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:09.058
I went to several butchers
for these ingredients.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.298
I even used some isatis roots
in the soup.

00:34:12.399 --> 00:34:13.939
It cleanses your liver
and improve your sight.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.538
Don't you have eye problems?

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.781
Now you can have "an eye for an eye".

00:34:19.284 --> 00:34:21.259
Preceptor, I think my sight
is perfectly fine.

00:34:21.384 --> 00:34:24.311
But my brain hurts.
I am going to pass out.

00:34:26.354 --> 00:34:28.715
It's okay.
Everyone gets a surprise.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.591
Yours...

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.919
This egg soup seems rather normal.

00:34:42.459 --> 00:34:46.043
I got the inspiration
from Master Tang.

00:34:46.144 --> 00:34:47.582
-How is it?
-Master Tang's fish soup...

00:34:47.683 --> 00:34:50.280
left me wanting for more that day.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.510
But the ingredients were
a little too simple.

00:34:53.611 --> 00:34:57.091
So I used pig's brain...

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:59.628
to substitute the eggs.

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.989
Pig's brain. It's good for yours.

00:35:03.639 --> 00:35:04.981
You should have some yourself.

00:35:06.479 --> 00:35:07.858
Do you need some?

00:35:07.959 --> 00:35:09.262
It's too greasy, I will pass.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.520
You caught a cold at the riverside.
Have some tonic.

00:35:22.051 --> 00:35:23.059
Never mind.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.459
I think I am doing just fine.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.365
-I am recovering very well.
-He is full of spirit.

00:35:27.479 --> 00:35:29.762
No. The coldness
will reside in your body.

00:35:29.863 --> 00:35:32.066
You need to get rid of them.

00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:34.120
Have a guess.

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:36.316
What did I use for the cuisine
for Master Tang?

00:35:36.439 --> 00:35:37.851
How should we know?

00:35:37.952 --> 00:35:39.613
I bet you didn't know.

00:35:40.982 --> 00:35:42.702
-What is it?
-Scorpion!

00:35:45.224 --> 00:35:46.971
Well, Xiao Liu.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.578
I remember you fell into the water.

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:52.311
I am giving you a chance
to have some tonic.

00:35:52.439 --> 00:35:53.679
I made this specially for you.

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.280
-No.
-I insist you take this.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:57.360
-Come on, take it.
-I made this for you!

00:35:57.461 --> 00:35:59.022
-Sir!
-Drink this all you want.

00:35:59.103 --> 00:36:00.179
He is just trying out the taste.

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.175
-Come on.
-Silence!

00:36:02.276 --> 00:36:03.467
Let me finish it.

00:36:03.919 --> 00:36:06.120
Finish your food or I'll make
these every day for you...

00:36:06.221 --> 00:36:07.621
until you decided to finish them!

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.459
Let's eat!

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.036
-I'll eat it.
-Let's eat.

00:36:12.231 --> 00:36:13.379
I am eating it now.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.016
Eat heartily.

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:20.690
I can't take this anymore.

00:36:24.159 --> 00:36:26.061
No one impresses me like you do.

00:36:26.162 --> 00:36:27.777
I've only been away for a while,

00:36:27.879 --> 00:36:29.952
and you managed to give
everyone here food poisoning?

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:32.940
I didn't know the recipes
are for these awful foods.

00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:34.682
You cooked pig's brain for them?

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.643
I made sure to clean
the meat properly.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:39.415
I should clean your mind properly.

00:36:39.639 --> 00:36:42.299
Eating pig's brain will take a toll
on the male's potency.

00:36:42.679 --> 00:36:43.950
When taken with wine,

00:36:45.439 --> 00:36:47.637
it's a recipe to subdue the urges.

00:36:48.199 --> 00:36:49.528
Are you sure about this?

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.019
Of course.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.644
You are turning every man here
into woman like you.
