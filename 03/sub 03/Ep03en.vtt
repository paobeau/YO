Mom, you're doing a circus instead of aerobics?

14
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.680
I dress fancily to show other people. How do you not know?

 - Madam Lee.

- Let's go have fun. 
 - If I go, what are you going to buy for me?

17
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.550
Just go change your clothes and come back.

18
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.160
You must change!

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.180

Oh my, come here!

22
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.130
Ever since I was young, I always suspected my birth.

23
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.670
I was right. My real mom wouldn't do this.

24
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
If I wasn't your real mom, would I have bought you these expensive and pretty clothes?

25
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.990
How is it so luxurious and gorgeous? It looks so good on you.

26
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.670
It's fine. It'll make me feel sorry.

27
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.930
I bought it because I feel sorry.

28
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.250
What happened to make you suddenly buy all these gifts for me?

29
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.860
Did you cause an accident?

30
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.930
No, what accident would I cause?

31
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.670
Why would you not cause an accident? You're going to be 40 soon, you should go around and cause accidents.

32
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.490
You're uselessly so straight-laced.

33
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.450
Seriously.

34
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.070
Ah. I should properly make an accident.

35
00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.850
Mom, you can't say anything different later.

36
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.380
Promise me. Here, stamp it.

37
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.640
What promise? What's with you?

38
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.500
I made a big resolution.

39
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.290
You should cooperate.

40
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.630
Hey. Hey, hey.

41
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.090
Will you please not fight today? I personally baked you homemade cookies.

42
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.180
- Wow, you know how to bake cookies? 
 - Sit.

43
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.680
Did you make them from dirt?

44
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.980
Contrary to what you look like, you sure have a picky palate.

45

Hey, let's order pig feet.

46
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.060
What a load of pig feet. She said it's a special party.

47
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.720
- Order chicken.
 - I came to have fun after three months.

48
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.190
I haven't had fun for six months.

49
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.400
I, since a few months ago, wanted to eat pig feet.

50
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.640
Every day, I made a promise to myself that

51
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.890
I'd eat pig feet for dinner.

52
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.440
After cleaning the house, taking care of the kids, cooking dinner for my husband,

53
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.540
and eating the leftovers from the kids, I don't feel like eating.

54
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.290
So I haven't eaten pig feet till now.

55
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.920
After three hours, I'll be back to the world without pig feet.

56
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.090
- Order pig feet. 
 - Yeah, pig feet.

57
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.990
Yeah, order some chicken.

58
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.910
Why are you close to someone like this? He makes me so annoyed!

59
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.920
No, we knew each other first. You butted in.

60
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.480
You're really annoying.

61
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.940
Why is she being like that? Am I polarizing?

62
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.900
- Don't mess with her. She's raising twin boys. 
 - Right, right, right.

63
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.070
Are you an alcoholic?

64
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.530
I think so. He got divorced.

65
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.990
I can hear everything.

66
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.380
- Hey, order some pig feet. 
 - Chicken, chicken!

67
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.910
- Pig feet. Pig feet!
 - Chicken! Order chicken.

68
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.450
- Pig feet. 
 - Chicken. 
 - Pig f—

69
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.760
Be quiet.

70
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.430
I have an important announcement to make before ordering pig feet and chicken.

71
00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.780
Here, fill your glasses.

72
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.020
This party is a celebration of the beginning of the second phase in Jang Hari's life.

73
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.790
I, Jang Hari, have decided on singledom.

74
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.430
Why do you guys have no reaction?

75
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.060
Whether you make it a formal or an informal announcement,

76
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.090
that's not something that you can control.

77
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.690
Look at me. I was single my whole life.

78
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.750
Who would have known I would end up like this after a cup of coffee?

79
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.390
Why announce it? Even though you made up your mind, you can't get married.

80
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.470
Why? Because of the blind date?

81
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.240
That only ended because we both agreed we weren't a match for marriage.

82
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.970
Can't you remember? Did you forget?

83
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.420
You never had love cells in the first place.

84
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.190

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.530

88

<i>Tomorrow's the deadline, so please go with someone else.</i>

94
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.320
<i>The tickets are until the end of this month, so are you available then?</i>

95
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.660
<i>If I promise and not go, I'll feel bad. By the way, the official document has been updated. Have you looked at it?</i>

99
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.450
<i>What...</i>

100
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.020
<i>He just asked you out on a date, you poop-head!</i>

<i>When will you become a human?</i>

102
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:21.530
That's why I hated setting blind-dates for you.

103
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.160
I didn't know anything then.

104
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:30.310
No... your DNA is messed up.

105
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.300
Okay, I agree. I can't date.

106
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.460
Marriage? I'm not doing it because I can't. So what if I can't?

107
00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.730
There are so many more things a person can't do than do.

108
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.270
Then, why did she try so hard?

109
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.950
Okay, okay!   You did well.

110
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.040
Even if you get married, you either hold a rag or dishcloth in your hands.

Yeah, thanks for the sincere words of encouragement.

113

I... actually have something to tell you.

114
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.200
Right, I got too much congratulatory money from you.

115
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.180
Okay. I'll buy you a gift as a remembrance of your misfortune. If you need anything, tell me.

116
00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:21.700
Fine, forget about it. That's not important...

117
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:25.860
Just take it. You're not gonna be able to get it until you die so you should just take it.

118
00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.140
Just be quiet. You're going to get hit if you keep messing with me.

No, I'm very comfortable.

The heels are part of the legs.

Well, I mean, I also used to wear heels a lot in my twenties.

Or do I have to misunderstand you?

285
00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.260
Is it weird that I'm being nice?

286
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.110
Very. A lot.

287
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.300

301
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:49.290
You're even interested in my heels. This is a little awkward.

302
00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:56.410
Right? I could misplace it.

303
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.860
I'll just accept this.

304
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.130

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:06.770
Okay.

It's so awkward.

308
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.830
Chunwang bought 2,000 strawberry-flavored tubes of toothpaste.

Yes.

- Can you brush your teeth with only toothpaste? 
 - No.

314
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.900
Then, what do you need?

315
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.680
I need a toothbrush.

316
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.980
I'll give you, who knows that info, another chance.

Try to work in a toothbrush, too.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.600
Okay.

319
00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:59.720
What did I tell you before? That the basis for sales is through the maintenance of networking.

320
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.830
When you visit them once, try to visit them twice.

321
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.870
And, of course, you need to check every little small thing precisely.

322
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:10.470
- Keep this in your mind! 
 - Yes, I will.

323
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.180
Earlier, I saw that reporter Choi Hyojoo's right heel was torn up,

324
00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.420
so I went and bought a band-aid.

325
00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.300
This kid...

326
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.350
You're a kid that understands ten things even if I only teach you one.

327
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.010
Well done! Customers are important, but

328
00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:38.340
your reputation at work shouldn't be taken lightly.

329
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.890
Especially, the publishing reporters.

330
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.800
I told you that they're our enemies, right?

331
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.900
You need to make them come to your side!

332
00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.550
Yes, I understand!

333
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.230
What's this? A skirt? What does she wear?

334
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.550
Why did you wash up today? Is it a special day?

335
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.290
No, Doha's poop got onto my clothes.

336
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.160
Doha's such a great daughter, making her dad wash up.

337
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.570
Is she sleeping?

338
00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.980
Yes.

339
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.340
I don't see your laundry.

340
00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:52.530
We should do our laundry ourselves, not have someone else do it.

341
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:58.090
I need to start working, but because Doha's so young, it's a big problem.

342
00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:02.610
I can't let her stay in a daycare center all day long either.

343
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:09.060
Geez, my back. My disc...

344
00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.360
With how much child assault is going on, I don't know if there's anybody I can trust.

345
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:18.230
It would be nice if it was someone I knew.

346
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:23.860
Why does my wrist hurt so much? I think it's carpal terminal syndrome.

347
00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:26.720
Are you going on vacation?

348
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.660
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome.

349
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.470
That's right. That's it.

350
00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:35.550
Yeah, you shouldn't push yourself at your age.

351
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.980
It's not easy raising a child.

352
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.790
I feel like it's harder to raise a child these days.

353
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.260
Even though I'm raising her roughly, it's hard.

354
00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:51.690
Back in the day, I raised Hari while holding her on my back and running the business.

355
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.940
Even though it was hard, Hari was so good.

356
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:59.170
She was so gentle and she laughed so much.

357
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:03.060
They're babies for only a moment but that lasts a while.

358
00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.060
I can watch Doha occasionally

359
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.240
and you can leave her with someone else but who would watch your kid like you would?

360
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.160
The time you spend raising her now

361
00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.480
will stay with her forever.

362
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.680
<i>[How about we meet up to negotiate?]</i>

363
00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.060
<i>[Ooen Coffee]</i>

364
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.580
<i>[There is no method in our country for an unmarried woman to obtain a sperm donor.]</i>

365
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.030
Hello.

366
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.200
By chance, are you...

367
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.640
"I'm the best (baby) producer?"

368
00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.740
Yes, hello! That's me.

369
00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.650
Please sit.

370
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:06.660
I'm 180 cm tall.

371
00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.060
My IQ is 148. My blood type is O.

372
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.810
I was in the special forces, and I'm a student at Hanguk University.

373
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.050
There's no doubt that my sperm is the best.

374
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.740
The best class... Yes.

375
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:25.400
Yes, yes. Please give it to me. Thank you.

376
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.160
Hot!

377
00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.120
So,

378
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:37.230
I haven't really... definitively decided to get a donor right now.

379
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:40.520
But I wanted to know how this system works.

380
00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.490
Should I call it a preliminary inspection? I'm also a reporter.

381
00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.530
I feel the urge to investigate things.

382
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:48.090
A reporter?

383
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.070
No! The thing is... I'm not a news reporter.

384
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.420
Magazines. Magazines. The magazines you see at the hair salon.

385
00:28:55.420 --> 00:28:58.400
We don't put out articles...

386
00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.700
Still...

387
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.200
By chance, if I were to receive your donation, wouldn't one have to get some information first?

388
00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:11.740
How you provide and receive the semen. Whether it's safe.

389
00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.600
It wouldn't be a free donation, right?

390
00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.850
I do this out of a sense of duty.

391
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:25.080
For people who desperately want a child. Isn't it the same whether it's a sperm donation or an organ donation?

392
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.720
Whether it's to save a life or to birth a life, it's the same.

393
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:36.380
Well, that's why I do this work so... In good faith, I charge ten million won.

394
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.380
- Ten million won? 
 - Yes.

395
00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:43.730
It's something I would do until you get pregnant. Isn't that such a low price?

396
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.710
Are there a lot of people that agree to this?

397
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:52.100
As you can see, I'm so superior. Once they see me, they do agree.

398
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:56.130
How many brothers and sisters are there that don't know one another in this world?

399
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.160
If you think about it like this, it's not something you can do.

400
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.990
Oh. Yes. Well, that's true.

401
00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.080
And more than anything, it's most important to have a healthy child.

402
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.570
That's why instead of doing an IVF or artificial insemination,

403
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.520
they receive it through natural pregnancy.

404
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.980
Natural pregnancy?

405
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:34.100
Yes. We align with their ovulation period and every night.

406
00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:35.030
Every night?

407
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.660
Every night! It's hard to be successful with just one time.

408
00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.270
The truth is, it's hard for me physically.

409
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.180
But because I think about it as public service, I do it with a happy heart.

410
00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:48.830
If you'd like to move forward, please contact me.

411
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.220
I noticed this from before...

412
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:58.630
but you're my type, so I'll treat you well every night.

413
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.190
This punk has lost his mind! You must've gotten hit in the head with a rock.

414
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.460
Stay right there. I'm going to call the police.

415
00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.700
This old lady suddenly went crazy.

416
00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.920
Old lady?! You said your vision is 2.0, huh?

417
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.560
That was a lie, wasn't it? I bet you didn't even go to Hanguk University!

418
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.520
You're just doing this horrible thing without any self-awareness.

419
00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.870
You're the one who wanted to do it! What horrible thing did I do?

420
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.840
Be quiet! Be quiet!  Be quiet. I'm reporting you right now.

421
00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.950
- Give it. 
 - Hey! Hey! Hey!

422
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:31.020
Hey, mister!

423
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.460
It's you, right? We're the police division.

424
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:39.390
We've received a report for illegal sperm donation and forgery. You impersonated a Hanguk University student, right?

425
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.550
- Let's go together. 
 - No.

426
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.260
You came at the right time. I was reporting him right now.

427
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.820
Please hurry and take him away. He's a really bad man!

428
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.860
You should go, too.

429
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.450
Me? Why?

430
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.560
You've been caught at the dealing site.

431
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.090
I didn't buy it.

432
00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:00.280
It's true. I didn't even get to see his sperm.

433
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.760
Do you want to get handcuffed?

434
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.220
You brought the car, right?

435
00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.840
Let's go.

436
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.810
They're coming down.

437
00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.100
Please say one thing.

438
00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.780
Hey! Be careful.

439
00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.720
- Please move 
 - They're coming.

440
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.050
Say a word, please! Say a word.

441
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.010
We're from the TV show "Unbelievable Incidents," can you tell us...

442
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.820
I have nothing to say!

443
00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:26.880
- Say a few words, please! 
 - Please move!

444
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.990
I feel so wronged.

445
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:29.690
This whole situation is not fair.

446
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:30.950
Can you say more about that?

447
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.480
Hold on.

448
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.690
Can you share what's unfair?

449
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.870
Detective, I— I was really scared.

450
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:43.100
I was so scared he might be part of a crime ring or something!

451
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:48.920
I only went there to do my job as a journalist.

452
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.010
Look at my hands trembling.

453
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:55.300
I don't have the guts to commit a crime.

454
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.070
You must have a really high arrest rate.

455
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.000
Live normally.

456
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.980
What does that mean?

457
00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:08.510
Abide by the laws and live like everyone else.

458
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.540
Of course, I need to follow the law.

459
00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.240
But there is such a thing as an individual's happiness that can't be protected by law and institution.

460
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:19.570
Miss Jang Hari, if you keep coming at me, then the investigation gets longer.

461
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.840
When did I come at you?

462
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:32.040

I'm a doctor, Department of Pediatrics and Youth.

Did you say something to her?

469

<i>[Hankuk University College of Medicine, Yoon Jaeyoung]</i>

You are a doctor at the Department of Pediatrics and Youth at Hankuk University.

You're the one who contacted that scumbag on the online forum for infertile patients.

Tell me the truth about the deal.

473
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.460

474
00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:28.080
It's correct that I'm a doctor, and it's correct that you are a detective. Right?

475
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.810
You have nothing more than circumstantial evidence of her at the scene.

476
00:34:31.810 --> 00:34:35.670
But instead of getting a witness statement from her,

477
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.840
you are interrogating her.

478
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.770
You... did you give money to that guy?

479
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.300
I'd rather help the poor.

480
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.020
See, it was because of her strong curiosity and her strong will to act that she's like this,

481
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.130
but she's not the type to break the law.

482
00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.890
Didn't you get a lot of awards and prizes for good conduct in school?

483
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:56.460
Yeah, I was the community service leader.

484
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.880
If you get to know frauds, they're all kinds.

485
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.570
You would have to get to know them to know,

486
00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:05.490
but I can tell well by looking.

487
00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:08.780
So that is why I'm testifying with my name on the line.

488
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.140
Are you sure you were working undercover?

489
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:18.450
Yes.

490
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:24.230
All right, since there was no money transaction and I've verified her identity, we can go now. Right?

491
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:31.740
Her identity's been verified, so you're free to go.

492
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:33.650
Get up. Let's go.

493
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.550
Yeah, let's go.

494
00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:40.280
You're able to proudly hold your head up?!

495
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.800
Because I didn't do anything wrong.

496
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.840
Wow, you're so shameless.

497
00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.880
You have a lot of things that you're bad at, but out of those, lying is the worst.

498
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.130
What do you mean you were working undercover?

499
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:52.420
What were you going to do with that sperm-selling man?

500
00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.050
I want to have a baby.

501
00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:01.650
What? With a 24-year-old?

502
00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.620
Don't you say you love him! I'm going to kill you.

503
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:08.160
No, I was told it was a donation.

504
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.570
But he said it was ten million won. It sounds like a scam, right?

505
00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.460
You were going to give money to buy sperm?

506
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.010
The baby is sleeping. Curse me out quietly.

507
00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.840
Of all things, you're really doing the craziest things.

508
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:25.990
You were going to become crazy because you couldn't marry, but are you really crazy?

509
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:30.230
I'm not marrying, I just want to have a baby.

510
00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:38.600
It's whatever. Just because I tell you, doesn't mean you'll understand nor do I wish you'll understand.

511
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.090
You really went crazy, huh?

512
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.890
This could be a problem ethically.

513
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:50.940
But isn't it weird? That it's only ethical if a man and woman marry and have kids?

514
00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:53.890
There's no way an unmarried woman can have a child.

515
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.690
So you'll do it alone?

516
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.000
I found out everything.

517
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:06.180
What to do?

518
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.220
I don't have thoughts about illegally having a child.

519
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:15.550
And I know I shouldn't have even researched about it, so I'm reflecting.

520
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.560
You're not reflecting on wanting to have a baby by yourself?

521
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.310
Okay, I know why you don't want to get married and how disturbingly you like children.

522
00:37:24.310 --> 00:37:29.300
But can't you just marry and have a child like normal?

523
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.120
I'm doing this to live normally.

524
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.070
I'm 39.

525
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:40.080
Even now, I still hope to meet the man of my dreams when I step outside those doors.

526
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:45.130
But the reality is that they call me "old lady."

527
00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.370
I don't exactly know what is considered normal living,

528
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:54.510
but I don't want to not do the things that I can do just because others frown upon it.

529
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:59.560
Having no choice and just living life as it goes,

530
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.930
39 is too young for that.

531
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:18.530
But...

532
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.570
Why did you bring the baby outside without a blanket? It's cold.

533
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:28.000
Hey, grab it.

534
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:10.560
I want to eat this. His is bigger.

535
00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.890
They're the same.

536
00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:15.320
No, his is bigger.

537
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.780
Give me the same thing as his.

538
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.860
Eat it.

539
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.350
Hey, kids!

540
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.450
Don't do that!

541
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.140
- Did it get on your clothes? 
 - Are you okay?

542
00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.060
Oh, goodness...

543
00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.160
Don't cry. Don't cry.

544
00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.950
Oh no, don't cry.

545
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:53.300
Who can take care of the baby?

546
00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.060
Here, here.

547
00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:57.690
I don't even hold my nephew.

548
00:39:57.690 --> 00:39:59.770
- Can you take care of the baby? My feet hurt suddenly.
 - My arm is hurting...

549
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.050
Why does your arm hurt all of a sudden?

550
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:04.500
Is there no one who can look after this baby?

551
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.200
I came.

552
00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.790
Jang Hari, the baby is crying.

553
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:21.450
Why are you scared?

554
00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:24.320
If a baby is crying, you need to hold them like this

555
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.370
and comfort her. Right?

556
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.440
Oh, poor baby, was it that upsetting? I hear you.

557
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.920
Oh, who did this to you? Goodness.

558
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.990
Right.

559
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.940
♫ <i>All the way over there</i> ♫

560

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.000
All right.

580
00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:09.360
Why?

581
00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.180
I'm buying the beer.

582
00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.820
No.

583
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:17.860
I'll buy the meal, too.

584
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.600
No.

585
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.540
Thank you for helping me with the photo shoot.

586
00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.550
Correct. My goodness!

587
00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.990
Why do you hate kids?

588
00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:36.260
Well does everybody have to like kids?

589
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.930
Well, no, but I was wondering if you had a specific reason.

590
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.150
No, nothing like that.

591
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:46.740
What if you need to film with kids again like today? I won't be able to help you every time.

592
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.260
Why don't you practice occasionally by helping us out?

593
00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.480
Do I just need to practice?

594
00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.060
Yeah, why can't you?

595
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.620
If you find something to adore, then they'll become adorable; and if you try to like them, then it'll become real.

596
00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:01.690
Saying you hate them is the problem, isn't it?

597
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:03.270
Do you want me?

598
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:04.300
Will you do it if I want you?

599
00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.440
No.

600
00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.300
I knew it.

601
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.440
Can I ask you a personal question?

602
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.190
Am I a bachelor because I don't like kids?

603
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.810
- How did you know? 
 - It's always like that.

604
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.790
It must be a question you get asked a lot.

605
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:21.980
Let's just say that.

606
00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:24.860
What if someone you love appears?

607
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:27.720
And you suddenly get a baby?

608
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.090
There's no way.

609
00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:35.020
I'm actually more of an iron wall than you think.

610
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.710
You never wanted to become a father?

611
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.220
No. No way. Never.

612
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.940
Why do I have nothing to wear?

613
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.780
Ah, I put it here.

614
00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:06.480
When did I do the laundry?

615
00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:12.520
What is this?

616
00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:18.920
What's this?

617
00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.450
Wow, he's crazy.

618
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.420
Lee Jaeyoung, why I ought to—

619
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:31.640
- You want food? 
 - No.

620
00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:49.330
I guess this is how I get to use my self-defense skills.

621
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:54.220
Wait!  Why do you beat him starting this morning?

622
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.170
I need to teach this punk a lesson. This cuckoo punk.

623
00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:04.910
You put your dirty laundry into my laundry basket? I know you went through my room. What'd you steal?

624
00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:08.540
I thought my sister would do at least that much for me.

625
00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:13.630
Considering how much I was cooperative on your secretive investigation.

626
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.640
Cooperation isn't easy.

627
00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:25.340
How dare you throw that dirty, disgusting foot at me.

628
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.790
Oh, this is wrinkled. You should've told me you had laundry. I would've done it for you.

629
00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:35.120
You said you'd do your own laundry. Just put it in the hamper. I'll do it all together. Eat before you go.

630
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:36.480
Oh okay!

631
00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.350
Should I remove my laundry from the hamper?

632
00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:45.750
Just leave it! I shall wash your laundry for you!

633
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.150
- I'll make it clean for you. 
 - Let go!

634
00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.460
That annoying cuckoo punk!

635
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:05.770
Aunt!

636
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:09.680
Let's go together!

637
00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.020
Isn't the weather cold?

638
00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.850
Aunt! Did you eat breakfast?

639
00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.070
Yes, I ate it.

640
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:24.210
Goodbye.

641
00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:26.690
Goodbye.

642
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:31.000
Aunt, lunch at the cafeteria today?

643
00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.540
Oh, yeah.

644
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.160
Goodbye. I'll see you later.

645
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:42.480
Ah, right. Today is the company dinner, Aunt. You're going, right?

646
00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:43.600
Not sure.

647
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.020
Okay. You're going.

648
00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.280
Goodbye. Goodbye. Have a nice day.

649
00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.040
Ah, right! Aunt, do you want to—

Oh my goodness, gosh... 
 <i>We want to know...</i>

677
00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:17.960
Mom.

678
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.540
Come in.

679
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:41.510
- Mom. 
 - You're doing all kinds of things now. You tried to illegally buy sperm?

680
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:44.660
Out of all things, you find life boring and want to try and go to prison?

681
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:50.090
Aunt, hit her after you hear her out. She was an undercover journalist.

682
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:55.240
You know those reporters who go in secret? She's amazing.

683
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:02.050
Is that true?

684
00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:03.600
Y-Yeah.

685
00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:09.330
Looking at her expression, it must not be. Tell me the truth. Were you going to buy sperm?

686
00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:12.270
Why would you buy sperm?

687
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.000
Mom.

688
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.190
I want to have a baby with a sperm donor.

689
00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:28.940
I'm sorry for making you upset, but I'm not marrying.

690
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:34.010
Just because you marry doesn't mean you live well. Also, Mom, I—

691
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:41.420
You want to raise a kid alone without marrying? Do you want to be a single mom?

692
00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.010
- Mom, that— 
 - You don't know how hard it is to raise a kid by yourself. You're crazy!

693
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:50.300
I also raised you alone, so my heart aches when I see other single mothers.

694
00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:55.230
"There must be a reason." People don't bother trying to understand. Even a mother who's raising a child alone.

695
00:50:55.230 --> 00:51:01.730
They'll criticize her and say she's tough and has bad luck. It's enough that I had to hear it, why should you?

696
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:08.000
Then, do I live alone for the rest of my life?

697
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.980
What if I don't marry? What if you're gone, too?

698
00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:22.720
Do I just live for myself? You said you live for me.

699
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:29.160
Without a family, do I just live alone, take care of myself, live well by myself, and die by myself?

700
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:36.820
I also want to live for someone else.

701
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:47.860
What a crazy girl. You, even after seeing how I lived,

702
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.190
how could you think about raising a kid by yourself?

703
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:54.710
You should think about getting married and living happily!

704
00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.070
You raised me well without a husband!

705
00:51:58.070 --> 00:52:01.730
No, I mean it was hard for you because Dad was there.

706
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:04.950
I grew up watching you and Dad fight.

707
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:08.850
Why would you tell me to marry when all you've shown me was a sad marriage life?!

708
00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:10.700
Is it my fault that you didn't marry?

709
00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.190
Did I tell you to learn after me?

710
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.680
Why is it my fault for your wrong choice?

711
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:17.380
What did I do wrong?

712
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.780
Is it wrong that I don't want to marry because I don't want to live like you?

713
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.350
Stop it.

714
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.860
Aunt, calm down and let's talk tomorrow.

715
00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:33.500
Get out. You shouldn't mess up your life after seeing me.

716
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.970
Since you're so great, get out

717
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.480
and live as you want. Get out!

718
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:42.510
Get out! Hurry and get out!

719
00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:44.150
Go outside.

I'm so pathetic.

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.090
I'm 40 the day after tomorrow, but why am I so immature?

742
00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:42.600
It's okay, unless you leave the house because you are being yelled at by your mother when you are almost 40.

743
00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:49.780
I'm 41 and I still don't know what an adult is.

744
00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:56.110
The body ages, but the soul doesn't get old, you want to have nice things.

745
00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:58.570
You get upset when you hear unpleasant things.

746
00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:06.770
Suffering a loss is still unfair. I still feel everything I felt as a kid, so I don't get what's so different about being 40.

747
00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:14.130
There aren't many good things as you age.

748
00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:19.530
But if there are good things, that would be to have a good judge of character.

749
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.560
Even if the weird woman on TV is you, I know one thing.

750
00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:36.230
You're a good person.

753
00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.880
Who fought with Mom?

754
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.590
Look at you.

755
00:57:01.630 --> 00:57:03.940
We meet again.

756
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.310
Why are you here to find me? I was about to go in.

757
00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:08.760
So why did you go outside wearing someone else's shoes?

758
00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:12.570
Those are expensive and precious. Hurry and change.

759
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.120
What are you doing?

760
00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:25.100
W-What are you doing? Wear it and let's go home.

761
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:28.450
Let's go.

762
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.060
We live together.

763
00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.670
- What are you saying? 
 - Let's go!

764
00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:36.300
You are loud.

765
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:40.090
- Loud? What do you mean? I have the quietest voice! 
 - My goodness!

766
00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:00.280
You were hanging out with that guy out there?

767
00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:02.310
Do you really have to say it like that?

768
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:06.110
I just want to stop for today. Let's be quiet.

769
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.230
I'm not being sarcastic.

770
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:22.500
Whatever others say, you do whatever you want

771
00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:27.020
without thinking of others.

772
00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.640
What's with you suddenly? Go inside.

773
00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.150
I submitted my resignation letter at the hospital.

774
00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:38.160
You still have a leave of absence. Weren't you trying to be a professor?

775
00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:43.840
As a single parent, how am I supposed to find time to lecture, meet patients, and write publications?

776
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.580
Even though it's such a pity and it feels unfair.

777
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:52.030
What am I going to do? Just live.

778
00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.820
Just live? How?

779
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:59.320
I am going to open a hospital with the money I earned from selling my house. That's why I moved into your house.

780
00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:03.830
I've been living without any plans after I was abandoned with my child.

781
00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:08.530
But in the midst of that, that little thing became something I could lean on.

782
00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.370
How can I understand you entirely?

783
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:19.360
But you need someone and if that's a baby, then I completely understand.

784
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.030
I'm a father.

785
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:29.990
You will also live your life as it comes.

786
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.420
As an opening present, I will give you an appearance in our magazine.

787
00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:37.980
You can get published and even write a medical piece.

788
00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.020
That would be great.

789
00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:42.160
However...

790
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:48.000
How about we give Doha an appearance, too?

791
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.430
Jaeyoung, Doha is only pretty in our eyes.

792
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.100
What are you saying? Doha is pretty because she takes after me.

793
00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.980
- I can't give her an appearance because she looks like you. Go in. 
 - There you go.

794
01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.410
I'm going to do an interview.

795
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:18.860
Where are you going? You must have something to tell me.

796
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.710
There's nothing.

797
01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:23.450
No, you definitely have something to tell me. Go into the conference room.

798
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.950
Hey, wait! You didn't shoot the probiotics ad yet, right?

799
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:29.730
- Why? 
  - They asked us to recommend a doctor.

800
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:31.260
You know a pediatrician, right?

801
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:35.060
I know a medical doctor who would do very well.

802
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.150
I shall cast him.

803
01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.570
You could give him a phone call.

804
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.270
Is that the reporter who likes to run?

805
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.560
I don't know.

806
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:54.170
Why isn't it working?

807
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.250
It looks fine.

808
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.300
Suho!

809
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.790
Go and fetch the doctor.

810
01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:01.430
Doctor, we are ready for a test shoot.

811
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:04.760
Oh, please stand on the mark here.

812
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.460
Just tell me.

813
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.870
The woman who got caught trying to buy sperm is you, right?

814
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:11.820
- No. 
 - Wow!

815
01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:16.090
You're such an adventurous woman! Are you going to keep looking for sperm?

816
01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:19.060
Don't be like that and just do a project with a man.

817
01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.340
If I do that, feelings are going to get complicated.

818
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.120
And there will be a problem even if the man says he'll take responsibility.

819
01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:31.450
And if I have the baby without him knowing, then won't I end up in a fiery pit? That's against moral ethics.

820
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:36.750
I just think it's best to get someone's sperm with their consent.

821
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:41.980
Like a Hollywood movie? They usually get it from a drunk coworker or a friend.

822
01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.300
I don't know any men.

823
01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:49.900
Hello.

824
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.380
This is the product. It sends you straight to the bathroom.

825
01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.650
Oh, wow.

827
01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.690

<i>[Oh My Baby]</i>

835
01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:07.800
<i>Don't look at her.</i>

836
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:12.560
<i>The look in her eyes says she's up to something crazy. If you acknowledge her, you're done for.</i>

837
01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.420
<i>Where are you all going together?</i>

838
01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:16.280
<i>Why do you guys live together if you are friends?</i>

839
01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.120
<i>Can we not live together?</i>

840
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.510
<i>We are in that kind of relationship.</i>

841
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:23.290
<i>He's dangerous. He has the physiognomy of a scammer.</i>

842
01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:27.750
<i>You really think I'd fall head over heels for a bad boy and get burned?</i>

843
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.320
<i>Only make mistakes with me.</i>

844
01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.090
<i>Don't fall for some random guy just because you're lonely.</i>

845
01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:36.180
<i>Younger specimens will have better sperm, right?</i>

846
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.330
♫ <i>You...</i> ♫

847
01:03:37.330 --> 01:03:42.140
♫ <i>My heart beats and I can't say anything</i> ♫
