You probably didn't eat breakfast.

It's not that I didn't recognize you,

Did you not hear anything?

56
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.930
Is it because you're worried that she's going to live without a baby?

57
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.790
I'm worried that she's going to live alone.

for a man to donate their sperm to a woman they don't know?

60

62

63
00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.700
I'm just saying she can at least have a kid since she might not be able to get one.

64
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.350
Even if it's now, everything is solved if she meets a good man.

65
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.670
I don't think she'll meet a man.

Are you saying she should grow old by herself?

69
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.080
Auntie, should I just take care of you both and live together?

I don't think you'll learn from being scolded.

120
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.420
You'll see that you learned from watching your seniors.

121

Meal! Meal. Please.

134
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.600
- Well, since you made me work out, I'll buy you a meal. 
 - Really?

135
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.010
You really... I can't believe you.

136
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.000
No. I'll buy it.

137
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.150
Do whatever you want. You really...

138
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.030
Thank you!

139
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.870
You're talking about the photo that's going on the restaurant flyer, right?

140
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.660
Of course, it's possible. I'm good.

141
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.030
Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Give me a call!

142
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:36.700
Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Yes!

 - Oh, you scared me!

144
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.770
Are you still working part-time?

145
00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.980
Since when were you here?

146
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.390
Because I don't know when Hari leaves work, I'm waiting for her.

147
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:49.020
You're going overboard!

148
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.430
I can't stand it!

149
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.590
How many part-times are you doing?

150
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:59.760
Advertisement manuals, wedding stills, flyers. Anything I can get.

151
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.020
Are you having it really hard?

152
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.010
My kid plays the flute and she happens to be good. She's good but...

153
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.130
she says she needs to take lessons.

154
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.560
With the academy fees and this place's rent...

155
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:13.900
It's $5,000 per month just for my family to breathe.

156
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.780
It's a reality that I don't want to know.

157
00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.810
When I look at you, I'm so jealous.

158
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:24.660
Why? Because I'm a bachelor?

159
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.160
You're still successful.

160
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.930
I'm usually not the type to get jealous over someone else's success.

161
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:39.050
But now that I've been working so hard, I'm getting petty.

162
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.610
Why did I turn out like this?

163
00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.560
I think for me, it was hardest to live by working so hard.

164
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.040
Senior, you're amazing.

165
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.540
Punk.

166
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.310
You get ready to slowly be amazing, too.

167
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:02.160
Since you're dating Hari seriously.

168
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.650
Let's do this!

169
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.800
Wait... Sami-sami-hong-sam! (energy booster)

170
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.380
I need to eat this and perk up.

<i>[the baby Editing Department]</i>

172
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.430
Guys, go home and sleep!

173
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.980
Goodnight!

174
00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.270
Good job! Hurry and get home.

175
00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:59.190
Get home.

176

<i>[Mr. Yisang]</i>

177
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.390
Let's go home.

178
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.380
You must be very tired. Go inside and get some good rest.

179
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:26.270
Get home.

180
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.720
Sleep well.

181
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.540
Wait...

182
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.360
Can you change a fluorescent light bulb?

183
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.470
<i>What fluorescent light bulb?</i>

184
00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.310
The entire house's fluorescent lights are so bright,

185
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.330
my eyeballs are about to burst. So, which fluorescent light bulb are you needing changed?

186
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.600
No, the fluorescent light in my room.

187
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.710
It's flickering!

188
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.500
Really.

189
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:08.970
Go inside. I'll change it for you.

190
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:10.890
Freeze.

191
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.300
Retreat one step.

192
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.770
Aren't you at the age where you finished civil defense?

193
00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:21.040
It's because I'm sensitive to maintaining public security. As a former military policeman.

194
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:26.240
I'm sensitive to injuries as a former medical officer.

195
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.650
I'm an old bachelorette, so I'm sensitive to those bothering my dating life.

196
00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.950
Control yourself. Auntie isn't sleeping.

197
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.610
Go and tell her. She'll be happy.

198
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:41.820
You must be tired after staying awake for two nights.

199
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.580
Go ahead and get some sleep. I'll change out that bulb for you later.

200
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.530
Get home safe.

201
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.460
You're bad.

202
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.360
Go on then.

203
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.940
- Where are you going? 
 - Let go.

204
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:06.270
I let go.

205
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.050
- Don't put your hand on me. 
 - Okay!

206
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:10.650
I'm a scary person.

207
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.330
Go inside.

208
00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.820
The baby's going to wake up! Walk quietly!

209
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.990
Hari's home!

210
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.680
Auntie! This stew... I'll bring it up to her, right?

211
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.200
I'll bring it up to her tomorrow. Leave it alone.

212
00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.470
No, she looked super hungry.

213
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.350
Really? Then I'll—

214
00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:53.170
Ugh, Yoon Jaeyoung, that little—

215
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.330
Hey! Wait!

216
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.250
Oh my God, seriously!

217
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.690
Apart from emergencies, don't come up here.

218
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.270
It's courtesy that I come down.

219
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.470
This stew is in an emergency state of deliciousness. Come eat.

220
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.330
You're craving a drink, aren't you?

221
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.170
Not a drink.

222
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.370
A dog would stop pooping. 
 (T/N: Korean expression meaning old habits die hard.)

223
00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.460
Why? Did you want a drink?

224
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.160
Ah, whatever. I'm tired.

225
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.910
Well, why are you so busy? Huh?

226
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.870
Why are you so tired?

227
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.230
Are you usually this busy or is it just this month?

228
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.090
I don't know. We have a lot of specialties this month, and...

229
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.750
It's my first month as chief editor.

230
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.770
In honor of your promotion, I'll get you a gift.

231
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.540
Whatever, I don't need it. What are you trying to get out of this? Trying to scam me out of double whatever you give me?

232
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.100
Why do you always think so little of me?

233
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.650
Hey, I've now stopped drinking,

234
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.590
I'm taking better care of Doha, and treating Auntie with filial piety.

235
00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.290
I'm going to treat you well, too, so tell me everything.

236
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.030
What you want, what you want to do: all of it!

237
00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.430
Huh?

238
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.940
Are you sleeping?

239
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.960
Go and sleep in your room.

240
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.470
<i>Left, right, left, right!</i>

241
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:23.090
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

242
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.040
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

243
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.060
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

244
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.570
<i>Diagonal steps!</i>

245
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.120
<i>Diagonal steps!</i>

246
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.750
<i>Oh!</i>

247
00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.820
<i>Good job!</i>

248
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.980
Goodbye!

249
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.850
Yes, yes.

250
00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.740
I do this on the weekends, too. Come out if you're free.

251
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.780
Aerobics is a great respiratory exercise!

252
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.370
Really?

253
00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.060
I was in need of respiratory exercise.

254
00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.930
Oh, that's perfect!

255
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:14.470
I also started because I didn't have good health,

256
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:18.690
but my body got better and had more energy so I got certified in it.

257
00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:22.090
Getting old is a sad thing,

258
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:26.190
but your body hurting is the worst.

259
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.520
Do you know why grandmas and grandpas are strong?

260
00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.200
No.

261
00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.090
'Cause they're seniors. 
 <i>(T/N: Word play. Sounds like "No Weakling")</i>

262
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:44.000
Oh my, oh my, so funny! What the heck!

263
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.820
Oh, really?

264
00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.970
You're the first to laugh at my jokes!

265
00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:50.930
Why? That was so funny! Oh my, oh my!

266
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:55.730
Oh, maybe you and I are on the same wavelength.

267
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.180
I think so, too.

268
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:00.320
Is it going well with your girlfriend?

269
00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.260
Yes.

270
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.830
I mean, I want to see her every day,

271
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.240
but I haven't been able to. But it's going well.

272
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.420
I see. When it's going well, it seems like fate and all.

273
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:18.000
But now that I've lived a while, I've learned that there are other fates.

274
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:21.440
What? Fates?

275
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.020
So even if it doesn't work out with your girlfriend, don't be too upset.

276
00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:30.960
Your real fate could be the daughter of the woman sitting next to you.

277
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.120
The heiress?

278
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.080
Of a building; a huge one!

279
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:47.590
Oh, I'm going to... I'll get going first.

280
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.340
All right. Goodbye!

281
00:21:56.430 --> 00:22:01.450
Is the old restaurant out in front a good place to eat?

282
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:05.520
You haven't eaten there?

283
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.190
Oh, uh...

284
00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:12.830
I guess I got here at the perfect time.

285
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:15.090
Let's get lunch together.

286
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.000
I want to stop hating you.

287
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:24.610
I'm the bad one.

288
00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.790
- That's why I'm clinging onto you. 
 - No.

289
00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.520
You don't think you did wrong.

290
00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.860
I'm also human. I feel guilty.

291
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.830
No matter how much I wasn't like a mom, I'm still a mom.

292
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.260
You've never come to see Doha before.

293
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.540
I didn't know how to see her.

294
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.220
Seo Jungwon...

295
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:53.410
I have a woman I like.

296
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:58.240
Why is someone with so much pride clinging like this?

297
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.520
Forget about us.

298
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.900
Is it because I still love you so much?

299
00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.710
Why do I keep feeling like you cheated on me?

300
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.030
If that's not it,

301
00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.990
if Jang Hari also loves you,

302
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:21.930
I'll let you go.

303
00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.340
Damnit, I'm really...

304
00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:37.520
- Where are you going? 
 - You scared me!

305
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.910
I thought you were just going to lie around in your bedroom for 4 days and 3 nights.

306
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.480
But the weather is nice.

307
00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.640
I was going to go get some sun.

308
00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.700
- You want me to go with you? 
 - No, I want to go alone.

309
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.160
Okay.

310
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.020
Go have fun by yourself, and sometime soon, bring him home.

311
00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:03.560
Goodness... If you wanted to hide it, you should've denied it until the end.

312
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.950
What?

313
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.300
How do I trust your sense when it comes to a man? Bring him. I have to see him to know.

314
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:15.580
No, I don't want to. Are you going to tell him you want to meet his family tomorrow and have the wedding the day after?

315
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.880
Why are you so relaxed? I'm so anxious that I can't even sleep.

316
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.660
Just wait and see.

317
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.160
We have to go through all the steps no matter how much of a rush I'm in.

318
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.920
Mom, I'll be back after my date. Bye.

319
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:37.160
That little... You're so happy you've lost your mind!

320
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.680
How pretty.

321
00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.000
I hope he's a proper one.

322
00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:48.450
Wow, it's twinkling. Doesn't it seem like the galaxy?

323
00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.390
Oh!

324
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.250
Would you please?

325
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.190
This is a good place to take pictures.

326
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.040
It's pretty. Plant cave.

327
00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:09.070
Wow! 
 <i>[Plant Cave]</i>

328
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.270
Don't these look like hands?

329
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:13.270
That's true. Is this real?

330
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.300
I think so.

331
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.000
It's very fascinating.

332
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.650
I'm sorry, but could I ask you to take a photo?

333
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.760
Yes! I'll do it.

334
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.740
Will you please gather up?

335
00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.640
Gather up.

336
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.670
1, 2, 3.

337
00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:32.690
It's a bit dark here, can you move this way a bit?

338
00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:38.290
Oh, a mining car?

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.270
Ah, this is...

Could we find each other here?

Uh, wait. I'll find you.

361
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:04.350
- My goodness.
 - My legs. Should we sit for a bit?

362
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:11.480
We're so used to being alone for a long time.

363
00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.000
- Right? 
 - Is that so?

364
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.930
From now on, let's...

365
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.700
make it a habit of doing everything together.

366
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.340
You found me in one try.

367
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:26.400
Was this place too easy? I was wanting to test fate.

368
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.590
It wasn't that hard. I just got a feeling

369
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.930
and came here and tada! You were here.

370
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:41.490
That we could find each other so easily in this type of cave,

371
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.700
isn't that fate?

372
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.460
To be honest, there may not be such a thing like fate.

373
00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:52.830
But when you fall in love, it might be that you want to insist it's fate.

374
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.700
Probably...

375
00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.770
because people don't want to break up,

376
00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.030
I think they say it's fate.

377
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:06.860
- Is that so? 
 - If not, then never mind.

378
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:15.390
What do you want to do now?

379
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:17.220
Do you want to eat something?

380
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.620
What do you want to do?

381
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.450
I... want to do what you want to do.

382
00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.090
Don't match your preferences with mine.

383
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.060
Then it'll feel unfair later. Like you're the only one sacrificing.

384
00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.500
I'm not sacrificing.

385
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.960
I just want to be like you.

386
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:42.480
Because I've lived my life doing what I want until now,

387
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:45.650
I want to do the things that the person I like wants to do.

388
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:48.800
That's how I learn about you.

389
00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:53.020
Then let's take turns doing what we want.

390
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.420
I also need to learn about you.

391
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.520
Will you be okay?

392
00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:11.350
If you treat me this well and I start hoping for more, what are you going to do?

393
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:18.000
If you keep doing favors, you'll become Dooley.
<i>(T/N: Dooley is an animated dinosaur that says "hoihoi" every time he casts a spell. Word play with "favors.")</i>

394
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.190
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.690
The dad jokes are a bit hard for me.

396
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.330
One day, you'll become funny, right?

397
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:37.780
- I don't have any more to show. 
 - No...

398
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:44.110
But... that's how we get familiar with each other.

399
00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.160
That's why...

400
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.470
I'm trying to like babies.

401
00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:08.790
It's not like I don't understand your perspective.

402
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.410
But I...

403
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.870
But I...

404
00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:22.650
Me not liking kids...

405
00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.760
-<i> Silkworm pupae!</i> 
 - was because of silkworm pupae.

406
00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.890
<i>- Silkworm pupae!</i> 
 - Silk...

407
00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:37.750
Anyway...

408
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.980
The reason I didn't like kids

409
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.550
<i>- Ice pops! 
 - Pops...</i>

410
00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:45.610
<i>Ice pops!</i>

411
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.950
What I'm saying is...

412
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.650
- I... 
 - Yes?

413
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:57.710
- Really that⁠— 
 <i>- Mister!</i>

414
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:03.670
... mister. I think I'm a mister. I'm so old now.

415
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.120
<i>Mister!</i>

416
00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:12.010
Anyway,

417
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.200
I don't hate kids.

418
00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.590
I know.

419
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.170
I know, so don't look at me like that.

420
00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.890
I'll tell her. Do you think it's that easy to tell her?

421
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:40.520
If I tell her, she'll probably be shocked, right?

422
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:45.570
She'll probably be hurt, right? What is she thinks I'm a fraud?

423
00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:52.240
I...

424
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.450
because I might lose her,

425
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:58.930
I'm very scared.

426
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.540
- Is Mom sleeping? 
 - Yeah.

427
00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.070
I got caught by Mom red-handed.

428
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:46.370
If Mom asks about Yisang, pretend you don't know him. Don't curse him out.

429
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:52.010
Why? Is something wrong?

430
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:58.140
If I didn't date Jungwon, what would have happened between us?

431
00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.020
We would just be like this. Why?

432
00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.260
Do you regret dating Seo Jungwon?

433
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.830
I feel like by dating Jungwon, I missed out on my real life.

434
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:21.960
How did you forget about your undying love for each other?

435
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.610
It's still vivid for me.

436
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:29.420
<i> I heard a lot about you. I was wondering when he was going to introduce you.</i>

437
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.390
<i> You're pretty.</i>

438
00:34:31.390 --> 00:34:32.750
<i>Pardon?</i>

439
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.690
<i> You didn't tell me she was pretty.</i>

440
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:41.630
<i>Oh, her? Well, she has eyes, a nose, and mouth on her face.</i>

441
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.150
<i> She's not particularly pretty though.</i>

442
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.170
<i> You crazy...</i>

443
00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.590
<i> I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything much by it.</i>

444
00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:56.280
<i>Jungwon, why would you be sorry? If you did something wrong,</i>

445
00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:00.090
<i> it's because you're so pretty that she can't stand it. That's your sin.</i>

446
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.390
<i>What are you saying? Saying that in front of your friend, you're embarrassing me. </i>

447
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:06.210
<i> Why? It's the truth.</i>

448
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:13.290
You acted as if you two were the only people in the world.

449
00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:19.440
Yoon Jaeyoung, the things you lost and your regrets are all part of your life.

450
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.360
Even if you go back in time, you'd pick her.

451
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.640
I don't have to go back in time because I know what I regret.

452
00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:30.680
That's why you should have treated her well when you had her.

453
00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.780
I did love her to death.

454
00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:41.430
If I treated her well, she wouldn't have left.

455
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:45.380
I did regret that a lot.

456
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:53.160
But now... I don't see her.

457
00:35:55.350 --> 00:36:01.280
A person's feelings are so shameless.

458
00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.730
What's going on? Did they leave?

459
00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.330
They went out to look for article materials.

460
00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:27.360
Looks like they went out to have some fun.

461
00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:30.300
What did they say?

462
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.650
They're upset that sales declined.

463
00:36:33.650 --> 00:36:36.650
They also said to put more attention into the cover model.

464
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.470
How about Kang Hyojoo?

465
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.540
I'd be thankful if she did but she won't.

466
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:51.320
After seeing the news about infertile couples, a lot of people are wondering about the ovulation inducers so I was thinking we should write about it.

467
00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.790
Sure, well, there are a lot of infertile couples lately.

468
00:36:56.790 --> 00:37:02.600
Go for it. There are regulations to medicinal supplies so give me a list of the variety and I'll upload it for review first.

469
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.260
Okay.

470
00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.370
Then I'll also go and look for an item.

471
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:11.480
Have fun.

472
00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.530
- Work hard. 
 - Goodbye.

473
00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:16.610
What's the matter, Eutteum? A meeting?

474
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:18.830
Do you have time on Saturday?

475
00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.660
If I don't have anything, I'll make an appointment. Why?

476
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.930
Can you make that appointment with me?

477
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.360
That's going to be a bit hard. Are you talking about the meal from last time?

478
00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.510
Yes. Make sure to give me some time.

479
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.290
I'll contact you on Saturday!

480
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:36.770
No... Eutteum? Eutteum!

481
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.900
I'm his mentor...

482
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.420
This is complicated.

483
00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:52.010
What did you do for today's lunch?

484
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.500
Manager Kim bought it for me.

485
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:58.720
Although he doesn't buy often, I got him a precious autographed CD.

486
00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:01.530
You did a big job.

487
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:05.970
What do your parents do? How many siblings do you have?

488
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.170
Where are you living?

489
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.630
A one-room studio. But what kind of meeting is this?

490
00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.430
It's membership training.

491
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.490
Since we've somehow ended up working together frequently,

492
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:23.360
I think we should get to know each other better for a more comfortable working experience.

493
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:32.380
Do you know... the ring size?

494
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.220
I did it without her knowing.

495
00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:40.020
You're more discreet than I thought.

496
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.460
So... when are you going to confess?

497
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.170
This week on Saturday.

498
00:38:49.170 --> 00:38:51.050
Okay.

499
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.120
What?

500
00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:54.350
I said okay.

501
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.740
<i>[OHOPHAIR]</i>

502
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:15.530
Put your career on the line and make me the human personification of "lovely."

503
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:22.790
I'm going to be in one man's memories forever today.

504
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.800
Welcome.

505
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.530
Hello. I'm here to buy a Cartier ring.

506
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.800
A Cartier ring?

507
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:35.990
Here's the product you were looking for.

508
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.910
This is... Cartier?

509
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.180
Yes.

510
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.930
I request the size to be this.

511
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.600
Oh, Chief Editor! Can you come out right now?

512
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.890
I'm at Mr. Jo's restaurant.

513
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.590
Really?

514
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:21.000
<i>I'm also there! Wait a bit.</i>

515
00:40:40.990 --> 00:40:43.220
I... I...

516
00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.640
You guys are playing a game, right?

517
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.600
This is hand wrestling.

518
00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:02.230
We... are dating.

519
00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.510
What?

520
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:10.290
Keep it a secret from Manager Kim. He's quite a bit backward, so.

521
00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:14.030
You came? I'll bring a chair around.

522
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.270
Thank you.

523
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.950
You should sit down.

524
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.550
Eutteum?

525
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.260
You can sit...

526
00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.570
Eutteum? Where are you going?

527
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:57.890
If Eutteum asks you to meet him with just the two of you, don't meet him.

528
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.070
If he says he's going to show you a masked dance, you can't meet him even more.

529
00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:07.220
Eutteum can do a masked dance? I'm curious.

530
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:10.930
If you're curious, I'll learn it. Masked dance...

531
00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.330
- Pull yourself in. 
 - Okay.

532
00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:22.210
But... is it okay if Eutteum knows about us?

533
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:26.880
He's such a kind and innocent friend, so he won't tell anybody.

534
00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.560
Don't worry.

535
00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.610
Except for Manager Kim, every company worker knows.

536
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.230
They all know?

537
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.860
Of course. We all have eyes.

538
00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.100
If you're going to hide it then don't touch each other.

539
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.800
If you guys are going to be like this, just publicly announce it.

540
00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:44.500
We also had a hard time hiding it from you guys.

541
00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.190
Sorry.

542
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.770
- You're going to eat whatever, right? 
 - Yup.

543
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.350
I thought we weren't being obvious.

544
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.690
There are a lot of things to manage.

545
00:42:57.690 --> 00:42:59.710
Manage?

546
00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:04.020
Is Yoon Jaeyoung going to continue living with you?

547
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.840
Until he leaves on his own.

548
00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.760
My mom thinks of him as a son.

549
00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.730
I'm sure it's bothersome but just ignore it.

550
00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.950
He keeps trying to act like my older brother.

551
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:19.420
Like he's some human barricade. Don't worry about it.

552
00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.950
Okay. I won't.

553
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.330
Then what should we do? A beer after we eat?

554
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:25.960
Okay.

555
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.990

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.820

00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:19.750
Here?

564
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.590
A bar in front of our house. Why? You want me to bring something back for you?

565
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.550
What would I ask you to bring back?

566
00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.760
What's he saying?

567
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.860
I said I'd have one. Look how many I've had.

568
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.250
Have you tasted the gambas? (taste sounds like gambas)

569
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.550
Wrong! Wrong.

570
00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:52.960
It's only me that's drunk.

571
00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.840
It's been a long time. It's nice to see you.

572
00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:01.420
Do you want me to drop you off at your place?

573
00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.970
Do you want to come to my house?

574
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:13.590
No. The fluorescent light was the truth,

575
00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:16.180
but this really isn't.

576
00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:25.680
I... want to take you to my place right now.

577
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:32.700
You're... supposed to race on the Autobahn,

578
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:37.640
but... I can't race with you.

579
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:39.640
Autob⁠—

580
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.300
What?

581
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:50.560
Because our speeds aren't the same, there will be an accident.

582
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.090
What does that mean?

583
00:46:55.580 --> 00:46:59.570
Let's not ask for the reason.

584
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.750
The ramen smells good.

585
00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.560
Do you want to eat ramen? 
 (T/N: Korean equivalent of "Netflix and chill.")

586
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:17.100
Do you want to eat it?

587
00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.000
Ramen? What kind of ramen?

588
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.100
Cup ramen?

589
00:47:22.100 --> 00:47:26.060
Auntie, a beer please!

590
00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:34.280
I was... out for a short walk.

591
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.970
You sure drank a lot of beer this late at night.

592
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:40.870
Hey, quickly go home.

593
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.920
Thank you.

594
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:53.030
Hari, do you want to eat ramen at my house?

595
00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:04.230
I'll go. I like ramen.

596
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.390
Make black bean noodles with some steak. Are the three of us going?

597
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.720
The two of us should go. That's okay, right?

598
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.690
Why? Can't the two of us go?

599
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.960
Why? Two of us can't go?

600
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:16.570
I want the two of us to go.

601
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:18.920
Let's leave after we drink.

602
00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:28.440
Are you going to eat it, too?

603
00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.590
I'm not eating.

604
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.890
What's with the ramen this late?

605
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.860
I suddenly wanted some.

606
00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.620
You said you weren't going to eat it.

607
00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:55.590
Did you really believe that? Tell me honestly. Did you or did you not know that I was going to ask for a bite?

608
00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:59.740
You really are going to get hit one day.

609
00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.660
Auntie, after drinking,

610
00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:07.490
she was going to go to a man's house to eat ramen.

611
00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:09.590
Hey!

612
00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.350
What's wrong with that?

613
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:18.060
No, the meaning of going to a man's house for ramen is... Auntie, you...

614
00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.850
He lives alone, right?

615
00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:26.050
Of course, I'd go to a house where he lives alone. Why would I go where three generations live together?

616
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.380
Look at her! Look, look, look!

617
00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.420
- Why are you intruding on her personal life? 
 - What?

618
00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:36.320
Is he just a jerk who's only after one thing?

619
00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.180
No! He's careful.

620
00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:43.220
He doesn't take me to his place nor does he come here.

621
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.750
No matter how hungry you are, there's a process and an order to things.

622
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.700
You didn't boil the water, but you're putting the noodles in?

623
00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.470
We're already at 100 degrees.

624
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:59.220
100 degrees? You don't put the noodles in even though it's boiled to 100 degrees?

625
00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:02.650
If the man is 100 degrees, he should be able to cook the ramen on his palm!

626
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.820
That is what I know to be a man!

627
00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.150
Is my wanting a baby burdensome?

628
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:32.050
<i> Auntie, should I just take care of you both and live together? </i>

629

But marriage is more difficult for me than babies.

A child is a family that I have no choice but to love once it's born,
