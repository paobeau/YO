33
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.970
Do I look good?

34
00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.830
The elders say that the bride and groom can't meet before the wedding.

35
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.990
Otherwise, it will bring bad luck for life.

36
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.820
I am a bandit. Everything I do involves danger and violence.

37
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.250
I'm not afraid of bad luck.

38
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.950
Each day where I get to live freely and happily is a day earned.

39
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.170
This is you giving up on yourself.

40
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.560
It's not too late to turn around.

41
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.090
Why do I need to turn around? I also want to be a good person.

42
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.190
I want to earn money, go back home, get married, and be filial.

43
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.830
However, those crooked officials used their power to bully us.

44
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.360
Not only did they not pay us, they even wanted to kill me.

45
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.170
Now I cannot go anywhere. My mother died due to illness.

46
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.050
I didn't have the opportunity to go back for the funeral.

47
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.930
So why should I be a good person?

48
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.890
Duan Feng.

49
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.340
My body feels dehydrated lately.  Got too much eye gunk.

50
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.790
I got the medicine you wanted.

51
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.140
But why do you need matches before you apply the medicine?

52
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.330
You probably don't know.

53
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.060
Before dealing with wounds, you need to disinfect the wound.

54
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.110
So tedious.

55
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.960
But after you marry me, you can ask for anything you want.

56
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.750
I promise you a life better than in the county office.

57
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.940
- Do you know a melon you forcibly picked won't taste sweet? 
 - Then I won't have it.

58
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.170
When I am rich, I can buy the sweetest melons.

59
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.710
Do you see Zhu Dacong?

60
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.830
He is the son of the Jinan magistrate.

61
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.040
His family is rich, but I don't want to be with him either.

62
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.650
Love cannot be measured by money.

63
00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.510
If you really love someone from your heart,

64
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.320
whenever you think of them, you get the same feeling as eating candy.

65
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.510
When you are sad, think of him and you will feel better.

66
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.710
I don't like to eat candy.

67
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.890
But after meeting you, I know that candy tastes good.

68
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.960
But when I see you, I feel like being full of steam buns.

69
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.570
Then take your time to digest.

70
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.370
Your name is Tan Lingyin?

71
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.020
Even though tonight's wedding is shabby,

72
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.350
but they said the marriage contract is essential.

73
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.900
- But I don't know how to read. 
 - Really?

74
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.260
Can you teach me to write my name?

75
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.020
Okay.

76
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.120
You really don't know how to write it?

77
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.430
- Duan. 
 - Okay.

78
00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.190
Feng. Duan Feng.

79
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.800
Let me try.

80
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.350

Duan Feng.

83
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.790
It's my first time writing. Don't laugh at me. It looks a bit ugly.

84
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.250
Actually, you're kinda cute.

85
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.830
You practice. I'm leaving.

86
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.860

Perfumes and cosmetics were also prepared and we will send them over later.

90

I don't know what the boss likes about you.

91

You body is not as good as mine.

Are you done? Why're you still here? Want to watch me change?

93

it doesn't matter if I watch.

95
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.180

Wow!

98
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.140
It's the groom's big day.

99
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.460
Why do you have time to visit me?

100
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.040
I'm here to show off, of course.

102
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.750
why are you so greedy?

103
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.360
We barely escaped death and got the gold.

104
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.510
Do you think I won't share it with you?

105
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.390
How can you send someone to kill me?

106
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.960
I planned and did most of the work during the operation.

107
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.620
How come I got such a small share?

108
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.540
What is the difference between you and those bastard officials?

109
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.690
You never cared about our lives.

110

But today is my big day,

 - Do you think I'm that easy?

161
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.400
It's been three days. Why hasn't the emperor done anything?

162
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.600
To say the least, this is strange.

163
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.600
If Adviser Tan didn't give us the exact location,

164
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.700
we'd have been dead in Phoenix Village.

165
00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.400
You are back.

166
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.900
Why hasn't His Majesty's army arrived yet?

167
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.800
Please forgive me. On my way to the capital, I was knocked unconscious by someone.

168
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.600
When I woke up, all the letters were all gone.

169
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.100
So I came back to report.

170
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.000
You can go now.

171
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.300
Yes, Sir.

172
00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.900
In my opinion, someone intentionally wanted us to be killed in the bandits' village.

173
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.930
<i>[Sincere and Righteous]</i>

174
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.600
Sir, please excuse me.

175
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:40.180
I bought out all the candied hawthorn sticks at Lao Si's store.

176
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.400
It's a pity that you were angry for too long, they all melted.

177
00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.700
Now, there is only one left.

178
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.600
Please don't be angry and eat it, okay?

179
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.200
I almost married someone else.

180
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.800
I'm sorry.

181
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.400
I tried to escape to find you in the morning, but...

182
00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.300
you didn't hear me and then they dragged me away.

183
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.700
This situation, blame me.

184
00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.700
It's all your fault.

185
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.400
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have gone out for a walk. I wouldn't have been kidnapped.

186
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.420
I promise...

187
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.790
this will never happen again. All right?

188
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.700
And then...

189
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.000
I'll change.

190
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.200
Change what?

191
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.800
Anything you want me to change.

192
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.200
What if I don't want you to be my Tang Tianyuan but my Tang Feilong?

193
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.000
All right. From now on, I'll be your Tang Feilong.

194
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.100
- Really? 
 - Really.

195
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.600
Tang Feilong!

196
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.700
I'm here.

197
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:52.300
Tang Feilong!

198
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.100
Promise me. From now on, no matter how angry you are, don't run away in the middle of the night. Okay?

199
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.000
It's very dangerous.

200
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.800
Can I eat the candied hawthorns on the stick now?

201
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.600
I'm starving.

202
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600
I'll cook for you later.

203
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.000
What about now?

204
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.700
Now, let's hug for a bit longer.

205
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.900
<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

206
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.600
Almost done? I'm starving to death.

207
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.800
No comparison, no harm.

208
00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.170
What's the big deal with the rabbit? I'll carve a little dragon for...

209
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.300
you and call it Little Dragon Tang! Don't be surprised.

210
00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.800
With your big clumsy hands?

211
00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:01.800
I wondered why Sir Tang was not in his room. Turns out you are with Adviser Tan.

212
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.200
Sir has been working so hard dealing with the bandits' issues.

213
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.400
I was thinking of coming to the kitchen to make soup for you.

214
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.400
I didn't know that, Sir, you have such great culinary skills.

215
00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.600
I'm fine. Thank you for your thoughts.

216
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.500
Adviser, I've been here for a while and haven't formally introduced myself to you.

217
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.200
My name is Jiang Muchun.

218
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.600
I know you are the assistant minister's only daughter.

219
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.000
Our food here is plain and simple, and not like the capital, are you used to it?

220
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.800
The county has it's own flavor.

221
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.500
I can't blame Sir Tang for forgetting to send letters to the capital.

222
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.350
When did I ever write you letters?

223
00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.800
After you left, I often visited your mom and kept her company.

224
00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.600
She didn't know where you went. She worries about you.

225
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.200
I'm going to go get bowls and chopsticks.

226
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.700
Miss.

227
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.700
Adviser Tan!

228
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.290
<i>[Manor of Diligence and Righteousness]</i>

229
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.100
Did you see Lingyin?

230
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.200
She left.

231
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.300
Where did she go?

232
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.300
Forget it. Come with me to the Material Evidence Room.

233
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.000
Wait! Are we not going to have dinner?

234
00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:04.700
Adviser.

235
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.830
Miss Jiang, why are you here?

236
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:15.200
Adviser, I really envy you. Living so free and unconstrained.

237
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:19.980
You can do whatever you want to do. And there's such a large space for a book store.

238
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.920
What about it?

239
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.240
You are however the daughter of the assistant minister,

240
00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.070
born in a noble family.

241
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:32.700
You don't need to do anything to get something that I need to work hard for.

242
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.640
Noble families have a lot of restrictions.

243
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:42.160
I learned the four arts since I was young
<i>(T/N: zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting)</i>. I read about the virtues and regulations for women.

244
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.160
Even something as big as marriage is arranged by others.

245
00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.950
I sincerely envy you.

246
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:53.070
Really?

247
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.020
You are lively, intelligent, and pretty.

248
00:18:56.020 --> 00:19:02.030
Truthfully, I couldn't stop myself from liking you from the first moment I saw you.

249
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:08.810
Actually, I came to find you today to eat and drink together.

250
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:13.290
Really? You like doing this, too?

251
00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.410
There's a distinctive taste when you eat and drink in the daytime.

252
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.430
You hold your liquor well.

253
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.410
Miss Jiang is also a straight forward gal. Thinking on it now,

254
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.040
at that time, striking the drum to voice a grievance was a bold thing to do.

255
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.900
But we can empathize with each other.

256
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.390
What do you mean?

257
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:39.460
Neither of us has a say in our marriages. But I was brave and escaped.

258
00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.830
And for you. If your father forces you,

259
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:46.220
then you must oppose him boldly. Pursue your happiness courageously.

260
00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.110
Miaomiaosheng is indeed Miaomiaosheng. Actually I've read a few graphic novels.

261
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.820
It seems perfect on appearance, but the reality is unfounded.

262
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.070
Let's take this "Tang Feilong Bravely Charges the Heilu Hall" as an example.

263
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.790
Tang Feilong broke the engagement to be with the lead female character at the end, right?

264
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.150
Although it's very romantic,

265
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.590
but if he did that in real life,

266
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:16.080
what should the abandoned lady do?

267
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.540
There's no possibility for her to be married, people will

268
00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.250
point their finger at her even if she goes outside.

269
00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:28.300
Does this novel only need to focus on the life of the lead female character,

270
00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.680
and the lives of the other female characters don't matter at all?

271
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:37.190
The novel is only a fairy tale.

272
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:41.030
it's only natural that it revolves around the lead female character.

273
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:46.940
I just think that if some of these forbidden feelings are allowed to exist,

274
00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:49.670
that will only make things difficult for people.

275
00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:54.040
If a couple is harmonious together, how would it make things difficult for people?

276
00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.950
So the reason you invited me to drink today

277
00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.980
wasn't to be my friend.

278
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.000
I do want to,

279
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:13.530
but if we love the same person, how can we be friends?

280
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:22.510
Before I came here I had planned to kneel before you.

281
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:25.050
I wanted to beg you. I would tell you I could give up everything.

282
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.410
I could even go back to the capital.

283
00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:30.330
To accept people pointing their fingers at me. I can accept anything.

284
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.740
But I realized I couldn't do it.

285
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.330
I really can't do it.

286
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.000
Miss Jiang,

287
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:43.700
although you came to Tongling because of your parents,

288
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.990
but you really wanted to also, right?

289
00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.620
No one in the world would freely give up their relationship to another.

290
00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.360
When did you two meet?

291
00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.900
It was when I was fourteen,

292
00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.210
My mother and I went to a poem gathering hosted by Lady Tang together.

293
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.500
Within the poems was an inscribed poem riddle that was extremely hard to solve.

294
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.160
The madames’ interest decreased and they gave up, turning around to eat and drink tea.

295
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.650
But I didn't forget. I constantly thought about that riddle.

296
00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.050
At this moment, Young Master Tang returned from school.

297
00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.240
He saw that I was struggling and stepped forward to discuss it with me.

298
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.160
There's no need to say anymore.

299
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:35.920
I am a novelist. I understand.

300
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:43.400
Afterward, there was one day when Old Madame Tang sent a person to communicate a message.

301
00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:46.520
She said she found some rare material,

302
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.160
and crafted two jade ornaments.

303
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:54.300
One ornament was a jade pendant, the other was a jade bracelet.

304
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.440
it's the one I have here.

305
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.870
Presumably, you must be familiar with the jade pendant.

306
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.820
Is it the one that he wears at his waist?

307
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.540
Yes.

308
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.430
This message is one that I understand.

309
00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.600
I believe that he must also know it.

310
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.500
<i>[Miaosheng House]</i>

311
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.960
<i>That was me.</i>

312
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.700
<i>I have heard that Assistant Zhou likes to eat sweet things.</i>

313
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.430
<i>It just so happens that I just got a local specialty from Chizhou, peach pastries.</i>

314
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.590
<i>I can give it to you as a present to alleviate your homesickness.</i>

315
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.900
Can it be that she knows my identity?

316
00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:49.040
<i>[Meet in the garden tonight.]</i>

317
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.160
Constable Zheng.

318
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:57.900
Constable Zheng, are you here again for Miss Ruyi?

319
00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.250
Miss Xihe, I advise you to eat a little less.

320
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.970
If you keep eating, will you be able to swivel your ribbon around?

321
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.810
And here I thought you only paid attention to Miss Ruyi.

322
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:11.200
Why are you so concerned about my weight?

323
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:12.450
I am not concerned about you.

324
00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:16.300
I am concerned whether the beams of this Miaosheng House are strong enough.

325
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.370
Constable Zheng has a discerning eye.

326
00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:23.990
The beams here are indeed old and in a state of disrepair.

327
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.200
I am even hoping that our county office will set aside some money for us.

328
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.470
Is the county office your home?

329
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.790
That you can just speak of making repairs and expect them to be done...

330
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.390
- Where is she? 
 - She's not seeing anyone! She's not here!

331
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.600
Miss Ruyi! Not here!

332
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.530
Is she here or not?

333
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:48.480
That can't be right. Just now, I still saw the light of a lamp in her room.

334
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.940
- Why was it suddenly extinguished? 
 - Excuse me, excuse me.

335
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.180
Are you forcing her to receive patrons again?

336
00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.600
Honestly, I'd love to see people in love to get together.

337
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.660
Your courting her so attentively every day like this but still not permitting the county office to set aside some money,

338
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.970
isn’t it going to make someone loathe you?

339
00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.940
You have no right to talk about me. Aren't you in the same boat as me?

340
00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.250
I have a marriage contract. Do you?

341
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:23.710
Goodbye!

342
00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:36.220
Assistant Zhou has arrived.

343
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.740
I didn’t expect Assistant Zhou’s to be so great at disguising yourself.

344
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.300
It’s been so long.

345
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.330
Everyone in the county office is still being kept inside a drum. <i>(T/N: kept inside a drum means to be kept completely unaware)</i>

346
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:54.140
But recently, it seems Assistant Zhou hasn’t been doing your work.

347
00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:56.560
I don't understand your meaning, Miss Jiang.

348
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:59.610
I have been striving to the utmost for the county office, taking care of everything personally,

349
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.400
and I believe that there has been no fault in what I have done.

350
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.970
Did Sir Zong send you to the county office merely to simply act as the magistrate’s assistant?

351
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.520
Who in the world are you?

352
00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:17.640
Since I dare to say these things to you,

353
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:20.900
how could I lack the self-confidence of escaping unscathed?

354
00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.860
When all is said and done, what is it that you want to do?

355
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.620
If you are the person behind the scenes that Sir Zong spoke of,

356
00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.980
then why did you prevent me from poisoning Sir Tang?

357
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.270
Zong Yiling doesn't get to decide his fate.

358
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.600
Most recently, the bandit that was captured by the county office knows a little too much.

359
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.410
If you have free time, then you should go and take care of him.

360
00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.580
I won't kill anyone for you.

361
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.940
Naturally, it's also not up to you.

362
00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:58.300
You have your method of escaping unscathed. I also have my own method.

363
00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.540
Of course, I know about Miss Ruyi's skills.

364
00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.880
But if Constable Zheng

365
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.470
learns of your real identity, what would he think?

366
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.870
- I'm so angry. 
 - What's wrong.

367
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.290
Don't you think she took the first strike to try and control me?

368
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:28.240
She even told me today to "treat Sir Tang nicely."

369
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.870
When did I ever mistreat him?

370
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:38.380
I finally understood what she said today.

371
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.410
Those two are the designated couple.

372
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.760
As for me, I have become the extra again.

373
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.490
She even made me out to be so insensitive to human feelings.

374
00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.030
Don’t pay attention to what Jiang Muchun says.

375
00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:53.840
You need to believe in Sir Tang.

376
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.190
I do trust him.

377
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.510
Then, why are you like this?

378
00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.270
Look. Ever since we came to Tongling,

379
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:10.350
all of the people that we've met are either good people like Sir Tang and Constable Zheng

380
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:13.380
or bad people like Landlord Sun, Sun Bufan.

381
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.360
Good or bad are so distinct, naturally, we don't need to worry.

382
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.270
We just needed to make things easy for the good people, and don't show mercy to the villains.

383
00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.580
But Miss Jiang clearly isn’t a bad person.

384
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.560
But I always feel that I am guarding against her.

385
00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.650
Am I petty?

386
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.330
It's not that you're petty...

387
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.610
you just love Sir Tang too much. Afraid someone will snatch him away.

388
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:39.160
If he can be so easily snatched away, then he isn’t the best.

389
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.710
I don't care for someone like that.

390
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:42.390
If you don't cherish him, then forget it.

391
00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.930
Eat some more. Feeling sad also requires energy.

392
00:29:47.430 --> 00:29:51.030
I, Tan Lingyin, must not be entangled by this kind of romantic feeling.

393
00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.480
I have to accomplish many important things.

394
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.220
For example?

395
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.000
For example... Investigating the gold case.

396
00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.120
<i>[I want to be better]</i>

397
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.760
Where are my brothers?

398
00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.120
I sent them to go learn to farm and to cultivate the soil.

399
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.820
When the moment comes, I will give them a piece of land and hope that they can stay there.

400
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:14.460
I just knew that you could not be without me. This is why you are so good to my brothers, right?

401
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.520
Now, you are really overthinking things.

402
00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.910
I'm here as the county adviser.

403
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.450
Tell me. What clues do you have regarding the gold case?

404
00:30:22.450 --> 00:30:25.420
Who branded that thing on your neck?

405
00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:26.610
How boring.

406
00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:31.320
I thought you came today to talk about getting married after I get out.

407
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:35.180
Things are like this already and you are still in the mood to think of this.

408
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.520
Is the food too delicious or the bed too comfortable in this prison?

409
00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.440
I, Duan Feng, have stayed in all kinds of places.

410
00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.050
Even if I lost my head, wouldn't it just be a scar as big as a bowl?

411
00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:48.160
Besides, you can't bear for me to die.

412
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.440
I see that you are a straightforward person, so I'll be honest with you.

413
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.830
I absolutely will not betray the person in my heart.

414
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.010
He's better than me?

415
00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.660
He's better than anyone in the world.

416
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.260
He has the temper of a young girl.

417
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.930
I don't care. I just like him.

418
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:22.200
You like him that much?

419
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.050
I say, you're such a good person, but why don't you have eyes?

420
00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:35.630
Let me ask you something. Are you and the magistrate mutually interested in each other?

421
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:38.960
And not your one-sided crush?

422
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.620
Otherwise, it really isn't necessary.

423
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.140
Of course, it isn't just one-sided.

424
00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:48.650
It's just that... It's just that there are special circumstances.

425
00:31:48.650 --> 00:31:49.810
- He— 
- Have you lost confidence?

426
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.740
Even if I say it, you won't get it.

427
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.820
I understand even if you don't say it.

428
00:31:54.820 --> 00:32:00.130
Your Sir Tang looks cold, aloof, and unreachable.

429
00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:03.190
He is fundamentally not a person of the same world as you.

430
00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.260
He's not that kind of person.

431
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.300
I've seen all types of men.

432
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.080
That Sir, he really is very unique.

433
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.140
Even if you aren't together with me, you don't necessarily have to chase that god-like immortal.

434
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.450
You will not be happy.

435
00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.440
God-like immortal?

436
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.820
Maybe you're right.

437
00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.050
Tang Tianyuan and Jiang Muchun are people of the same world.

438
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:44.110
Jiang Muya? <i> (/TN: Jiang Muya is ginger duck soup.)</i>

439
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.440
How come your family has nothing but goose and ducks?

440
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.570
It's a large gathering of poultry.

441
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.360
Why am I talking to you about this?

442
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:55.750
<i>Say it quickly. Who made that brand?</i>

443
00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:03.980
When I am hungry and haven't eaten, my ability to remember things is poor.

444
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:05.580
Who made the brand?

445
00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:10.930
Bring some wine and meat tomorrow, and I'll tell you.

446
00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.540
Fine.

447
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:17.320
You said so.

448
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.980
Go rest.

449
00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.680
You're leaving?

450
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.810
What else would I do?

451
00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:25.240
Stay a little longer.

452
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.670
Let me pass, let me pass. Get out of the way.

453
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.770
Zhu Dacong, where did Miss Ruyi go?

454
00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.880
I've run up and down several times and still haven't found her.

455
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.100
Who are you looking for?

456
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.030
Miss Ruyi.

457
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.880
Miss Ruyi announced that she is taking a vacation. That's right.

458
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.720
What? Why didn't you tell me she was taking a vacation?

459
00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:59.240
Can I read her mind?

460
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.250
I'd rather be able to read my wifey's mind.

461
00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.760
You are stabbing me in my sore spot.

462
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:10.860
Godfather already knows about Tang Feilong's identity, right?

463
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.100
Why has he still not contacted us?

464
00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.690
Sir Zong still needs to further work out a strategy.

465
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:18.470
Being this anxious, how will you be able to take care of things?

466
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:19.850
I can't worry about that now.

467
00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:23.390
Ruyi, what I said just now, do you agree with it or not?

468
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.090
I am worried that Tang Tianyuan will not so easily be convinced.

469
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:31.690
As long as we work together, they won't discover the truth.

470
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.990
Tomorrow morning, I will go to the prison to take over a shift.

471
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.540
- Afterward, you know what needs to be done, right? 
 - But—

472
00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:45.470
Godfather is facing challenges on all sides. He can only rely on the two of us.

473
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:47.320
<i>Brother Zhou!</i>

474
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.840
Cousin.

475
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:58.990
Today, Miaosheng House newly obtained two pots of nice alcohol.

476
00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.990
I brought them here. Let's not go home until we're drunk.

477
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:04.240
Where are your cups?

478
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.830
Constable Zheng, the cups are there.

479
00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.110
- I got it. 
 - Okay.

480
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.340
<i>[Do good]</i>

481
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.160
Here.

482
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:20.830
What's wrong?

483
00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:29.660
You are my flesh and blood cousin, I can't play dumb with you.

484
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.640
I think your sister is avoiding me on purpose.

485
00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:42.150
Sit down first. I'll get another chair.

486
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:54.330
Sir Tang, even if you want to talk with me alone, you don't need to find a rotten excuse like this.

487
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:56.780
If we're doing an autopsy, where is the deceased?

488
00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.710
Why did you go to the prison today?

489
00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.480
So you're allowed to be affectionate with your wife,

490
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:06.140
but I can't use my position as an excuse to visit my husband?

491
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.870
I'm not joking with you.

492
00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.190
I only went to see if his chain is sturdy,

493
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:14.690
so he can't escape and come and take revenge on me.

494
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:16.010
Really?

495
00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:18.370
And so what if it's not real?

496
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:22.080
Why is it that men can have three wives and four concubines but women must obey in turn three men <i>(T/N: father, husband, son)?</i>

497
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.240
You've taught me before that what men can do, women can also do.

498
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.170
When did I teach you that?

499
00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:30.950
You taught me with your actions.

500
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:35.980
Miss Jiang said it already. When she was fourteen, she fell in love with you at first sight.

501
00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.730
Did you forget?

502
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:40.590
You and I met when we were 8.

503
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.820
That's right.

504
00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.240
I met you before she did.

505
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.140
When I was eight, I took you to be my emotional and spiritual pillar.

506
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.220
So I did not actually stick myself into others' business.

507
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.680
Did you get jealous today? Me, too.

508
