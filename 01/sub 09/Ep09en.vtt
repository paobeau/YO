(Previously on Episode 8)
Pluck flowers when they bloom best.

16
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,660
You'll regret it

17
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,420
if Zhou Xiao becomes
another guy's girlfriend.

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,060
Why would Zhou Xiao come for the interview?

19
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,300
Because I like her.

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,140
I'll take care of the women's singles.

21
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,620
Zhu Lu, I'll train you first.

22
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,230
You were obviously enchanted by me.

(Episode 9:
Trilling Experience in the Library)

24
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,980
(Congratulations on the 100th anniversary
of Nanfang University)

25
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:18,870
Why don't we

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,520
use our authority and sneak in?

27
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,430
No.

28
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,460
Ms. Huang.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,360
Zhao Fanzhou,

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,310
you just came at the right time.

31
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,780
I need to scan a batch of precious literature

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,100
so that students can borrow the copies.

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,120
I scanned half of it
and have to attend a meeting now.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,710
Help me finish the work.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Okay.

36
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,470
Are you new here?

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Yes.

38
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
Hello, Ms. Huang. My name is Zhou Xiao.

39
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,870
I'm here to return this.

40
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,560
Hello.

41
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,360
Take it in

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,840
and help Zhao Fanzhou out.

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,470
Okay.

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,710
By the way,

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,140
remember to hand in your application forms

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,180
for entering the literature room
when you're done.

47
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,300
Okay, Ms. Huang.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,020
Goodbye, Ms. Huang.

49
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,500
Bye.

50
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,860
See?

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,880
Good people always get something for nothing.

52
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,080
It's a block-printed book
of the early Qing dynasty.

53
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,060
(Ink out, please replace the cartridge.)

54
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,330
Zhao Fanzhou,

55
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,700
can I take photos of it?

56
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,700
Yes.

57
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,800
Thanks.

58
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,190
Zhou Xiao.

59
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,260
Zhou Xiao.

60
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,820
Do you know Longtu Cases?

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
Ancient detective novels

62
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,220
like Bao Gong Solving Cases

63
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,380
all came from it.

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,300
I didn't expect there would be

65
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,660
one in the library.

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,430
Help me scan the book.

67
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,030
I need to wash my hands.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:37,980
You don't have to go to the bathroom.

69
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,490
I have wet tissues.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,900
I'll help you.

71
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,560
There.

72
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,500
Your hands are clean now.

73
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,460
Can I keep taking photos of Longtu Cases?

74
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll help you with scanning when I'm done.

75
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,630
Okay.

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,190
What can I do for you?

77
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,020
Arrange these printed papers

78
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,700
and fasten them together.

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,500
Like this?

80
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,660
Yes.

81
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,380
Okay.

82
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,720
What's going on?

83
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,340
Where's your phone?

84
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,620
What time is it now?

85
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,070
I don't know.

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,420
My phone is dead.

87
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,580
The library is closing.

88
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,220
Let's go.

89
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,140
I'll go fetch my bag.

90
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,700
OK.

91
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,180
What do we do now?

92
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,580
Where's your phone?

93
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,400
Don't tell me you haven't got it on you.

94
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,600
It's in the office upstairs. Let's go.

95
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,550
Have you watched Night at the Museum?

96
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,060
I've always imagined that I'm locked

97
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,510
in museums, libraries,

98
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,660
supermarkets, malls and so on.

99
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,920
My dream came true today.

100
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,820
Congratulations.

101
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,900
My phone is locked in.

102
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,620
What do we do?

103
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,920
Are we really going to be locked here?

104
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,900
Don't sweat it.

105
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,140
I'll turn on lamps of the reading area.

106
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,900
They're not controlled by the master switch.

107
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,980
If there's light,

108
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,430
perhaps someone will find us.

109
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,580
Okay.

110
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,580
I'll check if any chargers are left here.

111
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,180
No one turned up

112
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,080
and I couldn't find any chargers.

113
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,440
Will we freeze to death here?

114
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,860
I'll get you something to keep you warm.

115
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,220
Do you know how Eskimos keep

116
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,000
themselves warm?

117
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,220
I had no idea

118
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,100
we would be able to do this

119
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,940
in the library.

120
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,080
It's what you wanted to do.

121
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm just cooperating.

122
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,260
Wait.

123
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Don't force it.

124
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,660
Be gentle.

125
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,660
I can do it.

126
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,580
Trust me.

127
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,780
Okay.

128
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,140
Go on.

129
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,200
Be gentle.

130
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,480
We built an ice house of Eskimos.

131
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,700
I'll go in first.

132
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,980
It's quite warm.

133
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,390
It seems that Eskimos are as smart as me.

134
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,670
Zhao Fanzhou.

135
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,380
Come on in.

136
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,420
It's cold outside.

137
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,790
Sit on this.

138
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,790
The floor is cold.

139
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,750
Okay.

140
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,960
This is fun.

141
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,740
I'm going to write this in my novel.

142
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,750
It seems you can be happy

143
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,660
no matter what happens.

144
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,270
That's not really true.

145
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,740
I actually cry a lot.

146
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,660
I remember when I was a kid,

147
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,860
my mom was driven mad by my crying

148
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,780
and locked me in my bedroom.

149
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,020
And then

150
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,220
when she released me,

151
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
she found that I was playing
myself and laughing.

152
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,580
I've seen that when school started.

153
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:15,940
Really?

154
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,340
Did I cry?

155
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,420
On the day of registration,

156
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,860
you cried while reading
Journey Under the Midnight Sun.

157
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,540
It's touching.

158
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,340
Keigo Higshino's books are so good.

159
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,820
Then you said my phone seemed to be farting
when it vibrated.

160
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,960
And

161
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,540
don't you think when his phone
vibrated just now,

162
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,790
it sounded like someone's farting?

163
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,900
You laughed in the end.

164
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,260
You're talking as if I'm a fool.

165
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,620
Oh,

166
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,060
I'm so sleepy.

167
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,260
I wanna sleep for a while.

168
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,550
OK.

169
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,540
I'll let you be.

170
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,260
Sleep.

171
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,420
OK.

172
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,460
Before I met you,

173
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,740
I was especially afraid of seeing people cry.

174
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,500
After I met you,

175
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,740
it seems

176
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,700
I can understand this emotion now.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,180
Are you sure that girl never came?

178
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,320
Yes.

179
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,580
Thanks.

180
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,840
Did you find her?

181
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,500
I've looked for her in the VR Hall
we went to before

182
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,420
but I still didn't find her.

183
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,740
Did he find Xiao?

184
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,420
Have you searched the school carefully?

185
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,100
I'll go back and search again.

186
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,180
Okay, check again.

187
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,840
Zhou Xiao.

188
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,060
We found her. We found her.

189
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,220
Where have you been?

190
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,540
Sorry. Sorry.

191
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,150
Is she alright?

192
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Put her on the phone.

193
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,620
Hold on.

194
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,860
What's wrong with you?

195
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,180
Do you know we've been
worried sick about you?

196
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm sorry. My bad. My bad.

197
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,620
Say it to Cai Yasi yourself.

198
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,700
Hey.

199
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,220
Zhou Xiao, are you crazy?

200
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,780
Why didn't you come back
to your dorm all night?

201
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,220
I've been looking
for you since the early morning.

202
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Were you kidnapped by aliens?

203
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,300
I'm going deaf.

204
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,380
Calm down.

205
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,940
Last night

206
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,300
my phone was out of power

207
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,020
and I was locked in the library.

208
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,720
Stay where you are.

209
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,750
I'm coming.

210
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,620
Don't.

211
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,580
Don't come here.

212
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,940
I don't wanna be strangled by you.

213
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,140
Go back to your dorm
and catch up on your sleep.

214
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,140
I'll treat you and apologize later.

215
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,260
It'll cost you dearly.

216
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,820
What's wrong with you?

217
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm sorry. Sorry.

218
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,420
You have no idea how worried we were.

219
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,100
Yes, we've been worried sick.

220
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,860
We thought you were kidnapped.

221
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,580
I'll make amends to you later.

222
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,860
Let's take the course first.

223
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,540
Class will begin now.

224
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,500
Okay. That's all

225
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,670
for today's class.

226
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,500
But still

227
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,580
I need to recommend

228
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,300
my favorite writer to you,

229
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,740
Wang Zengqi.

230
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,300
We're in college

231
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,030
but we're still being kept overtime.

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,700
As you know,

233
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,660
he's King Shu of Overtime.

234
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,020
He even thought

235
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,840
that Wang Zengqi wrote

236
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,300
better than him.

237
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,580
Isn't that strange?

238
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,820
So he thought the most adorable side

239
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,100
of Wang Zengqi

240
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:36,820
was his attitude towards writing,

241
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,540
which is not being affected
by favor or despite.

242
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,540
After I analyzed these things,

243
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,860
you have got to...

244
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,620
Who's that furtive guy outside

245
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,740
waiting for?

246
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,820
Professor, me.

247
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,900
The class is not over yet

248
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,220
and your boyfriend can't wait already.

249
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,020
What's the matter with you?

250
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,380
No, no, no.

251
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,140
He's my younger brother.

252
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,670
He is

253
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,180
got problems here.

254
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,740
He once burned an Internet bar

255
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,200
and fought a group of people.

256
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,120
The other day

257
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,580
he even hacked

258
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,100
our campus network.

259
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,260
I have no idea what trouble he is in now.

260
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,580
Has he beaten any teachers?

261
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,220
Yes.

262
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Go.

263
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,740
What a novelist.

264
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,700
Okay. Where... where was I?

265
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,320
Oh, yes,

266
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,360
I was talking

267
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,870
about Wang Zengqi.

268
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,720
I said it was my treat

269
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,340
but you offered to swipe your card.

270
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,020
Looks like I can even win a lottery now.

271
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
You haven't told me what happened last night

272
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,300
and why you were locked in the library.

273
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,900
Don't mention that.

274
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,420
Yesterday I worked in the Room

275
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,660
of Precious Literature
and it's on basement-1.

276
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,540
That staff didn't know that

277
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,540
and locked us inside.

278
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,440
Us?

279
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:10,940
Zhao Fanzhou was locked there, too.

280
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,180
What did you say?

281
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,540
Who were you locked for a night with?

282
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,340
Don't get so vehement.

283
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,180
Sit down.

284
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,780
You stayed with a man alone.

285
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,540
Can you watch your deeds

286
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,180
as a girl?

287
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,860
How should I watch my deeds?

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,420
I didn't do that on purpose.

289
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,620
Besides, my phone was dead

290
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,780
and Zhao Fanzhou's was locked in a cupboard.

291
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,220
We were going to break

292
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,900
a window to get out of there.

293
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,260
So what did you do last night?

294
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,020
Sleep.

295
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,340
How?

296
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,500
Closed our eyes and slept separately.

297
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,780
You're speaking like my dad.
Have you realized that?

298
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,100
I shall tell your dad about this matter.

299
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,820
Don't you dare.

300
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,420
Cai Yasi.

301
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,260
Guan Bei.

302
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,420
Why didn't you go

303
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,580
to the training of ACM today?

304
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,620
I needed to do something else.

305
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:00,900
Let me introduce you guys.

306
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,060
This is my classmate,

307
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,660
Guan Bei.

308
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,260
She's my childhood friend, Zhou Xiao.

309
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,660
Are you going to the training this afternoon?

310
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,900
Yes. But I also have a rehearsal

311
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,780
so I may leave early.

312
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,580
Well, shall I tell you
about this morning's lesson?

313
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Why not? Have a seat.

314
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,740
This morning the professor

315
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,100
talked about

316
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,620
exponential data sampling.

317
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,540
I know that.

318
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,580
Fast exponential sampling.

319
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Awesome.

320
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,260
Where are you going?

321
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,580
Go on with your talk.

322
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,700
I have to be a volunteer and labor.

323
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,540
You have no talents. You deserve it.

324
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,780
By the way...

325
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,660
My younger brother has grown up.

326
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,790
How many members does
Programming Association have?

327
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,540
More than twenty.

328
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,350
Come in.

329
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,460
Dozens of us can take part in the activity.

330
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,220
Have a seat.

331
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,460
Can you pick up and see off guests?

332
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,310
Okay. No problem.

333
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,740
Then we'll leave it to you.

334
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,420
That's alright.

335
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,060
See you around.

336
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,780
Thanks.

337
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,340
You are...

338
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,940
I'm here to sign up

339
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,380
for the volunteer activity
on behalf of our club.

340
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:12,940
Okay.

341
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,140
I remember that you have few members.

342
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,860
I'll look for an undemanding job for you.

343
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,020
That would be great.

344
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,740
Thanks.

345
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,340
Only

346
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,220
moving supplies

347
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,020
and cleaning the campus are left.

348
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,180
Ah?

349
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,180
Then

350
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,860
we'll move supplies.

351
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,540
Isn't that too laborious?

352
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,060
I'll put you in another club.

353
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,060
No, no.

354
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,780
I can do that.

355
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,980
Thank you.

356
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,220
OK.

357
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,340
Can I really do this?

358
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,140
Just do it.

359
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,460
The student who's carrying bottles of water,

360
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,820
can you give us two of them?

361
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,380
Sure.

362
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,340
Two, right?

363
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,780
Yes.

364
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:24,820
Here you go.

365
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,380
Thank you.

366
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,830
You're welcome.

367
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,060
Hey,

368
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,300
can we have some, too?

369
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,500
Yes. How many?

370
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,100
Four.

371
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,580
Thanks.

372
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,060
Thank you very much.

373
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,420
Could you take some more here, please?

374
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,580
Okay.

375
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,500
Did you move

376
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,300
all those boxes of bottled water alone?

377
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,060
Yes, all by myself.

378
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,020
I was about to die for the anniversary.

379
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,420
Hello.

380
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,740
Hello, are you Zhao Fanzhou?

381
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,940
Yes.

382
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,820
Hello.

383
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,780
I was informed

384
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,420
that the guest you invited canceled his trip.

385
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,340
The guest canceled his trip?

386
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,860
Yes. It seems he has something else to do.

387
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:25,740
Sorry about that.

388
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,980
Okay. I've got it.

389
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,060
My apologies.

390
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
An outstanding alumnus

391
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,260
was gonna give a speech
at the opening of the celebration.

392
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,020
Now he canceled it

393
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,270
all of a sudden.

394
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:41,980
What are you going to do?

395
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,580
I'll see if there's a performance

396
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,460
that can take its place.

397
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:47,780
I'll help you think about it.

398
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,300
Help me think about it?

399
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
How?

400
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,660
Wasn't our club

401
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,260
going to disband

402
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,460
for not knowing what to perform?

403
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,820
Don't underestimate me.

404
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,740
I will find you a solution.

405
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,420
Okay.

406
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,020
Thank you.

Okay.

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,060
I'll go and test the spotlight.

413
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,460
I'll walk around.

414
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,500
Check if the light can catch up with me.

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,740
stop sighing.

431
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,700
The heroine in the TV play I'm watching now

432
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,060
chased the hero for eighteen episodes

433
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,220
and finally they were together.

434
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,380
Then they broke up after one episode.

435

But you sigh even more than the heroine.

436
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,740
I sighed because I promised Zhao Fanzhou

437
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,420
that I would come up
with a performance for him.

You care much about Zhao Fanzhou.

00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,540
What about Cai Yasi?

440
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,540
Don't mention him.

441
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,260

and what was my conclusion?

443
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,460
He made me shelter him from attack.

444
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,100
Crazy man.

445
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,340
By the way,

446
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,020
today I saw him

447
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,660
being super nice to a girl.

448
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,220
They'll definitely be together.

449

Cai Yasi has finally grown up.

450

I really can't understand you guys.

451
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,940
Don't mention him again.

No, we're not.

We're mainly responsible
for registering guests.

461
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,500
Can you perform anything?

462
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,240
Help.

463
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,780
I learned a bit...

464
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,540
Enough. That's enough already.

466

Don't worry.

If you really can't do it,

475
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,260
I can do those setting-up exercises on stage.

476

Come on. Come on.

477
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:44,820
Okay.

You know it, don't you?

524
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,420
We exert a force

525
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,420
and swing the racket.

526
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,820
The shuttlecock will be so high and far.

527
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,460
Whether we smash

528
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,460

537
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,700
Beauties of Fairy Castle

538
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,100
who are going to give us
a wonderful performance.

539
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,720
They're dancing. They're dancing.

540
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,740
Fanzhou, Fanzhou, Fanzhou,

541
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,180
how could I be so discerning?

542
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,220
Beautiful Lu,

543
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,500
we only love you.

544
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,860
Beautiful Lu,

545
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,060
we only love you.

546
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,020
Lu!

547
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,380
Quick. Get ready for the next performance.

548
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,100
Come on.

549
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,980
Put clothes on. Don't catch a cold.

550
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,420
Zhou Xiao,

551
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,900
I've known you for years

552
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,540
but you're really beautiful today.

553
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,820
Were you astounded by my halo?

554
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:16,700
Yes.

555
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,420
That shows you do have some discernment.

556
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,580
I'm going to the auditorium.

557
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,420
You must

558
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,860
give a good speech later.

559
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,740
The Badminton Club puts on
a fancy shuttlecock juggling performance.

560
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,540
How can she be so beautiful?

561
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,140
Have I been blind for all these years?

562
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:49,620
Lu,

563
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:50,980
do you hear it?

564
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,820
Such a great cheer.

565
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,100
Don't be afraid.

566
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,660
I'm here with you.

567
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,060
Lu! Lu! Lu!

568
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,380
What's he doing?

569
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,150
Life is so difficult for our Lu.

570
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,060
Keep doing it.

571
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,540
Spray it on your knees.

572
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,840
Thanks.

573
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,140
Excellent, Lu!

574
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,500
Let's thank the Badminton Club

575
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,300
for their wonderful performance.

576
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,420
As a famous century-old school,
Nanfang University

577
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,900
has outstanding students
from various departments.

578
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,140
Now let's applaud

579
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,700
the leader of ACM team,

580
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,100
the champion

581
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,060
of the 2016 ACM-ICPC, China,

582
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,020
Cai Yasi, who's going to give us a speech.

583
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:19,220
Hello, my dear teachers

584
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
and schoolmates,

585
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,420
I'm Cai Yasi from the Department
of Computer Science.

586
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,020
It's a great honor to stand here

587
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,660
and speak on behalf of our ACM team.

588
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,340
Cai Yasi.

589
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,700
ACM

590
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:28,780
is an international contest.

591
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,460
It's a great thing

592
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,220
that such a contest is being held

593
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,070
on campus for the first time.

594
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,380
That will truly promote the Olympic Spirit

595
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,230
so that more people will take part.

596
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,220
We will aim at the ACM-ICPC

597
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,420
and try to have
a good professional grounding.

598
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,140
In order to reach standards
of international training...

599
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:45,620
Don't move.

600
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,580
Our team requests that every contestant

601
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,700
to complete more than two hundred

602
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,740
problem solving programs before the contest

603
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,380
and pass all of the tests

604
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,700
on the website of ACM.

605
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,900
We hope we'll live up to your expectations,

606
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,780
win the gold medal

607
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,940
and contribute

608
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,900
to Nanfang University again.

609
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,500
Thank you.

610
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,900
Brilliant, Cai Yasi!

611
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:08,980
Gather sweet blossoms while you may.

612
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,540
Wait not till empty twigs are left.

613
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,820
You'll regret it

614
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,660
if Zhou Xiao becomes
another guy's girlfriend.

615
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,260
But

616
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,180
there's something more important
I need to say.

617
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,260
Zhou Xiao,

618
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,710
I like you.

619
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:46,380
Say yes. Say yes. Say yes.

620
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,220
I didn't expect

621
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,740
Zhou Xiao would be the second of us

622
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,460
to be in a relationship.

623
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,620
I thought it'd be Lu.

624
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,180
How come it'd be me?

625
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,140
Because I passed presents to you every day

626
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,180
for your admirers.

627
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,740
Sorry about that.

628
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,460
Where would Zhou Xiao
and Cai Yasi have their date?

629
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,380
It's their first date. It must be romantic.

630
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,620
Maybe a cafe.

631
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,380
It seems people all like
to have their dates in cafes.

632
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,020
It may also be a computer room.

633
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,140
I heard

634
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,620
those from the Department
of Computer Science all like

635
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,140
to meet their lovers in computer rooms.

636
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,980
I think

637
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,660
it should be a secret little forest

638
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,580
or a roof.

639
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,020
If the chemistry is there,

640
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,380
it'll be an exciting story.

641
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,820
Zhou Xiao.

642
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,020
Hey, you guys.

643
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,340
Why are you here?

644
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,580
Why can't I be here?

645
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,580
Hasn't Cai Yasi confessed his love for you?

646
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:33,500
Didn't you say yes?

647
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,340
Or you said yes but you didn't go on a date?

648
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,700
Or you have had a date?

649
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,220
Impossible.

650
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,340
She must have been here for a long time.

651
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,380
So what did you do?

652
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,260
Silence.

653
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,180
Listen to me.

654
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,140
Cai Yasi was taking advantage of me.

655
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,340
What?

656
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,400
Here.

657
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,780
Are you waiting for me?

658
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:54,620
Or what?

659
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,260
Are you crazy?

660
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,380
You are crazy.

661
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,500
You make use of me

662
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,380
every time you're in love with a girl.

663
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,460
I'm serious.

664
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,820
Serious?

665
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,260
When we were
in the first year of high school,

666
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,620
you liked Liu Renyu of class next door

667
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,620
and asked me
to pretend to be your girlfriend.

668
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,460
You said

669
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,820
that could make her jealous.

670
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,740
You also did that

671
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,620
at our high school's gathering last time.

672
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,220
You even went farther this time.

673
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,820
You embarrassed me in public.

674
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,620
I'm no longer the same.

675
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:39,020
I'm no longer the same either.

676
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,340
I learned Taekwondo
during the summer vacation.

677
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,780
I like you.

678
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,740
Stop saying that.

679
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,620
Do you believe I'll hit you so hard

680
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,740
that you can't even hold your mouse?

681
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,820
Tsk!

682
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:24,460
(The University's Centennial Celebration)

683
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,940
Why did you come out?

684
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,100
I needed to make a call.

685
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,100
Just now...

686
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,460
Just now what?

687
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:39,940
Nothing.

688
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,820
See you later.

689
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:42,660
Okay.

690
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,700
This is eating me up.

691
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,220
I should have stayed in the dormitory.

692
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,700
This is outrageous.

693
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,380
There's not a single post

694
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,180
about me and Lu.

695
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
Do you have no respect
for the badminton star?

696
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,620
Fanzhou,

697
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,820
have you read posts
on the campus network?

698
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,060
No.

699
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,140
Let me tell you.

700
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,580
Now all posts are
about the sudden confession of love

701
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,060
of the guy from the Department
of Computer Science.

702
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,660
I couldn't even find a photo

703
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,180
of me and Lu.

704
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,220
And you know

705
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,380
what the craziest thing is?

706
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,580
Everyone is saying that he's handsome

707
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,380
and romantic.

708
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,020
They said

709
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,940
if it were themselves,

710
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,860
they would definitely say yes.

711
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,740
He was turned down.

712
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,260
What?

713
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,740
How did you know?

714
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,340
I guessed.

715
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,860
Are you waiting for me?

716
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,190
Professor...

717
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,690
Or what?

718
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,260
I'm in the hall.

719
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,580
It was too noisy and I couldn't hear you.

720
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,030
I'll call you when I'm outside.

721
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,360
I'm no longer the same.

722
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,860
I'm no longer the same either.

723
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,980
I learned Taekwondo
during the summer vacation.

724
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,060
I really like you.

725
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,620
Stop saying that.

726
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,900
Do you believe I'll hit you so hard

727
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,980
that you can't even hold your mouse?

728
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,220
Tsk!

729
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,260
Why did you come out?

730
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,540
I needed to make a call.

731
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,900
Just now...

732
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,180
Just now what?

733
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,660
Nothing.

734
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,460
See you later.

735
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,420
Okay.

736
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,580
Fanzhou, Fanzhou.

737
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:00,860
Fanzhou.

738
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,900
You guessed right.

739
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,460
He was turned down.

740
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,740
He still failed after doing that.

741
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:14,620
It's really hard to win her affections.

742
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,540
Is she

743
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,940
Lu's roommate?

744
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,220
She's Lu's roommate, isn't she?

745
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,060
The president of the Detective Club.

746
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,500
You know her, don't you?

747
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,540
Yes.

748
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,420
This guy's failure proves

749
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,300
that it's hard to chase girls in that dorm.

750
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,620
Never mind. I won't over-think.

751
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,940
I must find

752
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,100
a photo of me and Lu.

753
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,620
(Psychology of love)

754
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,540
The department informed

755
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,180
that you need to go to an ACM training camp

756
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,340
for the first stage

757
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,020
of confined training.

758
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,260
It'll last for a week.

759
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,140
You'll mainly get trained
in classic common algorithms.

760
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,860
Type every algorithm

761
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,700
on the papers ten to twenty times

762
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:21,020
and simplify the codes yourselves.

763
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,500
Make sure that you can finish

764
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,300
typing them within ten to fifteen minutes
after the training.

765
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:29,580
How could you decide it just like that?

766
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,140
Can't we have a rest?

767
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,340
Right.

768
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,780
There's no much training.

769
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:34,980
Be quiet.

770
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,740
You shouldn't take that attitude, should you?

771
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,900
What are you thinking about, love master?

772
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:43,700
Mr. Liu said we were having
a confined training. Did you hear it?

773
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:45,900
Mm.

774
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,380
I heard it.

775
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,100
Good.

776
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,340
What's good?

777
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:54,140
Nothing.

778
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,460
(Next Episode)
-I really like you. -What are you doing?

779
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:05,780
Thank you, anyway.

780
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,500
That's it?

781
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,060
Want to be in a relationship now?

782
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,940
Yes.

783
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:10,900
With whom?

784
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:11,860

785
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,860
