In the operation today, the angle of your scalpel edge was too straight.

25
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Remember. When you are in the process of separating the skin from the superficial fascia,

26
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.600
you must tilt the scalpel towards one side of the skin.

27
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.400
Try to avoid leaving the superficial fascia on the skin as much as you can.

28
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.000
Do you know why we do that? I talked to you about it before.

29
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.400
It will help to avoid damaging the superficial fascia's cutaneous nerve as well as the subcutaneous vascular nerve.

30
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.000
Very good.

31
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.600
You must remember to combine theory with practice.

39

I've already talked to the Programming Club, they're looking for the ID now.

- It's a club that requires everyone to turn off their phones

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.800
Also, I've recently been writing a detective novel; it's serializing online.

111
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800
It's quite popular and its reputation is rather good.

112
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.000

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.800
Yeah, sure.

114
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.000

Right? In high school, I competed in the New Concept Writing Competition!

118
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.300
But your logic...

119
00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.200
Have you thought of writing something other than detective novels?

120
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.200
No, I have not. If it wasn't for my phobia of blood, I would have applied for a major in Criminal Investigations.

121
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.440

Older brother. Boyfriend.

Son. Husband.

170
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.000
Who really am I ?

171
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.560
Who did this with no sense of courtesy? How are other people supposed to stick anything on if it's stuck like this?

172
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.810
It's me.

174
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.630
An autograph is enough, right?

175
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.760
You've already ripped two of my posters.

176
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.730
Leave a few for my alma mater.

177
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.220
My school put up all of these posters just to welcome my arrival.

178
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.730
Isn't it inappropriate for you to rip them up?

179
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.250
You like to give autographs, right?

180
00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.920
You... just stop looking for me at school.

181
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.150
I hope that in the future you remain closer to sports but further away from my life.

182
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.730
Okay.

183
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:17.890
Are you crazy? Do you know how much this cost?

184
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.370
What does it have to do with me?

185
00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.740
In the future, I hope you only put up one poster for any of your events.

Hello, I'm your new roommate.

I'm a freshman at the sports college,  Xie Yixing. I play badminton.

189
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.450
You should know me, right?

190
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:53.390
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

191
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.870
<i> So indifferent. Is he nervous to meet someone famous? </i>

192
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:02.640
<i>Should I try to be more approachable?</i>

193
00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:10.030
I think our dorm is too clean.

194
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.540
You don't have to clean it up just for me. Really.

195
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.860
Don't treat me like a celebrity.

196
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:18.220
I'm really down to earth and easy to get along with.

197
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:37.980
Hey, I wanted to get some new earphones. Are those any good?

198
00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:42.780
Hey, do you hear me talking to you?

199
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.930
What's your name?

What major are you?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.490
Forensic science.

203
00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:53.530
Forensic science?

204
00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.410
Then are you really knowledgable about the human body?

205
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.330
Look at me. Look at my physique.

206
00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.490
Isn't this figure hard to maintain? Isn't it hard to train for? Isn't it?

207
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.030
Look at my explosive power. Come on.

You have a shoulder injury, right? I recommend that you stop doing that.

211
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.870
How did you know?

212
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:23.710
The friction sound at the glenohumeral joint during exercise,

213
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.280
is commonly seen in patients with severe rotator cuff tears.

214
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.630
Wow, you can even hear that.

215
00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:33.840
Let me tell you. My old injury came back during the competition last time,

216
00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.360
so I had to push back my registration time. It still hurts even now.

217
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.930
Find the place where it hurts and put pressure on it for ten seconds. That can help relieve the pain.

218
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:55.040
That's amazing.

219
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.840
Brother, you're pretty good. You're more reliable than our team doctor.

220
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:02.210
Our team is always just icing it.

221
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.460
It hurts so much, I hate it.

222
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.170
Icing it is also a very useful treatment method.

223
00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:13.330
Right? To thank you, I must treat you to a big meal.

224
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.870
Are there any good restaurants near the school?

225
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.360
The kind that is expensive, but you won't get full.

226
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.550
Do you know that my coach said that I've gotten fat? But I don't think so.

227
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.480
- Hello, I want to join the Anime Club. 
 - Our Anime Club is very popular.

228
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.250
You have to answer a few questions first.

229
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.070
- If we are like-minded, then we'll consider you.
- Okay.

230
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.930
What's your favorite anime? I'll base the questions off of that anime.

231
00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.930
Detective Conan. There's nothing I don't know about it.

232
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.670
What is the name of the poison that Conan was poisoned with?

233
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:41.190
APTX-4869.

234
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.190
What's the smell he is most sensitive to?

235
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:44.370
The smell of bitter almonds.

236
00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.740
Ran Mouri asked Conan where he learned to sail a boat. What did he say?

237
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.560
Conan said in Hawaii.

238
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.560
Go! The anime club doesn't welcome you.

239
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.560
Conan will always only love Ran Mouri. This CP ship will never sink!

240
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.880
All you think about is analyzing love. The most important thing about Conan is his detective spirit, okay?

241
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.760
I'm the club president. I am in charge of what we analyze.

242
00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.120
The anime club doesn't welcome you.

243
00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:07.160
I didn't want to join anyway! This club is false advertising! What's there to analyze about love?
<i>(T/N: Idiom: hanging the lamb's head but selling dog meat)</i>

244
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.060
His detective logic is worthy of being analyzed, okay?

245
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.260
South University really has some weird clubs.

246
00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:12.550
Why isn't there a Detective Club?

247
00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.500
Club President, just let it be.

248
00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.610
- Should I start my own club?
- I already put up the posters.

249
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.500
I'll come over after lunch.

250
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:28.900
These kinds of immature tricks, how many more times are you going to play it?

251
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.140
- Where are you going? 
 - The cafeteria. What about you?

252
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.100
I'm going, too. But I don't know if they still have food since it's so late already.

253
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.590
What is this? Xie–

254
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:39.770
Don't mention it. I met a psycho. Let's go.

255
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.590
A psycho?

256
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.000
Xiao Lu, did you know that you have to register with the Student Association in order to start a new club?

257
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.600
I know.

258
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:59.060
Okay, I'll bring the exhibition artwork over in a bit.

259
00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:03.350
I want to start a Detective Club, but I don't want to go beg the Student Association.

260
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.510
I don't get along with the Student Association's president.

261
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:08.290
Why would you be begging? Just follow the rules.

262
00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.310
As long as you meet the requirements for starting a club, there's no reason to reject you.

263
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:17.180
Right! I'll draft an application to start a club when I'm back at the dorm.

264
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:20.990
But there's a line about needing to prove the club is necessary when creating a new club.

265
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.460
How do I prove the Detective Club is necessary?

266
00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.800
Why don't you ask the Student Association? I'm not sure about that.

267
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.120
But I only know one person from the Student Association.

268
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.030
Wait, wait!

269
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.490
I said I would treat you to a meal. Why are we at the cafeteria?

270
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.810
I'm afraid it'll cause a disturbance once I show up at a place with a lot of people.

271
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.310
It's already past the lunch hour.

272
00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:59.170
So it's past lunch hour. No wonder none of the lights are on.

273
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.680
Hey, wait up!

274
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.430
Do you know that the last time I ate at the cafeteria was about a year ago?

275
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:15.100
Since I am now a public figure, I have to take note of my image.

276
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.290
Boring.

277
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.800
What's wrong?

278
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.390
Xiao Lu, can you give me some courage?

279
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:30.200
What?

280
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:40.770
Classmate, can we sit here?

281
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.860
Sorry, they're my fans.

282
00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.870
You have to get used to this if you're friends with me.

283
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.890
Is he the celebrity who drew on your shirt?

284
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:13.600
Don't whisper in front of me. Didn't I tell you not to follow me?

285
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.360
You even brought your friend along.

286
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.710
I'm warning you. If you keep following me, I'll...

287
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.870
You'll what?

288
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.290
I'll call you out on Weibo.

289
00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.290
Then do it. The one who will be embarrassed is you anyway.

290
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.000
What do you mean?

291
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.990
I'm not your fan. I'm a student here, too.

292
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.670
You can't be my fan just because you're a student here?

293
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:44.950
Besides, if you weren't my fan, why would you secretly tear my poster?

294
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:48.750
Because I need to put up posters for the Art Exhibit.

295
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.010
Your posters are all up in a row. How are other people supposed to put anything up?

296
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.240
What proof do you have?

297
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.940
I'm also a student here. I'm her roommate.

298
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.660
I can testify that she has been working on the posters in the dorm.

299
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:09.180
Then... fine. Then...

300
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:15.190
The cafeteria is so empty. Why do you insist on sitting next to me?

301
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.750
Because... Because I'm here to find him.

302
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.460
I want to ask you. If I want to create a Detective Club,

303
00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.220
how do I prove to the Student Association that the Detective Club is necessary?

304
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.890
I'm not eating anymore. It's too embarrassing.

305
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.640
Wait.

306
00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.150
What is it?

307
00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:54.220
Celebrity, you might not know this, but when us normal students finish eating,

308
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:56.940
we put back our own tray.

309
00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:06.150
All right, I'm going now. I have to change before I go do something in the afternoon.

310
00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.760
Okay, remember to take your ID.

311
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:22.420
So you haven't answered me yet.

312
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:31.510
The requirement is that it should be meaningful to student life.

313
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.970
Meaningful? Let me think about it.

314
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:48.290
Hello? I still need some more time.

315
00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.460
I'm not sure yet.

316
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:57.850
The Programming Club says that if the hacker acts again, we have a better chance of figuring out who it is.

317
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.200
All right. Bye-bye.

318
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.730
I can help you investigate this hacker. It'll prove that the existence of the Detective Club is meaningful.

319
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.890
But before I do anything, I need to confirm something first.

320
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.510
So I'll be leaving first. Bye-bye.

321
00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.900
I don't think I agreed to investigate it together.

322
00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.970
Cai Yasi!

323
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:39.000
<i>[Visiting Guests Room]</i>

324
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.920
Slow down. I'm right here. Why are you rushing?

325
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.000
What do you so urgently need me for?

326
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.970
- I need to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

327
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.360
The military training concluding ceremony situation, were you the one who did it?

328
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.050
Why are you asking that?

329
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:59.080
Cai Yasi! You didn't actually do it, did you?

330
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:02.520
Of course not! Am I that bored?

331
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.070
- Really?
- Really.

332
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:06.980
Okay, that's good.

333
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.280
- Then I can go and investigate without any restraint.
- Investigate what?

334
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.000
I want to start a Detective Club, but I have to catch the hacker first

335
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.170
in order to prove the usefulness of my club.

336
00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.220
You, catch hackers? And establish a Detective Club?

337
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.290
Stop looking down on me. I have ideas.

338
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.000
What ideas?

339
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.180
Aren't you good with computers? Can you help me investigate?

340
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.030
Do you think I'm crazy? I'm not helping.

341
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.680
I knew you would say that. Fine then.

342
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.420
I've already decided. I'm going to work with the Student Association's President and find the hacker!

343
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.540
Then the Student Association will definitely approve my application to start the Detective Club.

344
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.700
Student Association's President?

345
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.440
Are you talking about Zhao Fanzhou?

346
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.570
Yeah, him. Do you still remember him?

347
00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:53.290
Can't you just focus on your studies?

348
00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:56.870
Stop doing random irrelevant things and working with crazy people.

349
00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:00.780
It's not like you're helping me, why do you care?

350
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.890
I'm going now. I need to walk towards my brilliant future of establishing the Detective Club.

351
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.580
Hey—

352
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.410
Hey, Master. I was just looking for you. 
<i>(T/N: Da shen as in master, expert, guru)</i>

353
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.710
About looking for that hacker's ID... have you found the hacker?

354
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.410
- I haven't.
- Then, when do you think you'll find out?

355
00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.730
I can't find the hacker, stop asking me.

356
00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:34.070
If you can't find the hacker, it's fine. Why get angry?

357
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.900
<i>[Boys' Apartment]</i>

358
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:45.180
Hello? Zhao Fanzhou, Master can't figure out the hacker ID either.

359
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.400
Okay, got it. Thanks for your help.

360
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.720
The thing with the military training ceremony... the Programming Club can't figure it out either.

361
00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:01.620
It's just that everyone's talking about this matter.

362
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.990
I'm not purposely trying to bother you with it.

363
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.260
Everyone's attention is just temporary. Don't be too upset about it.

364
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.750
Wait, I have something else.

365
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:12.570
Recently, all the school's clubs are recruiting.

366
00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.710
Does the Student Association have any plans for recruiting yet?

367
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:17.340
Once the clubs finish recruiting, we're going to start interviewing.

368
00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.480
Then, will you be there?

369
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.230
You know that I easily get nervous. If you're there, I'll be more at ease.

370
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:26.690
I won't necessarily always be there.

371
00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.930
Then, when will you be there? I want to—

372
00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.850
Not sure.

373
00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:34.800
As long as you have the ability, you'll get in whether I'm there or not.

374
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.660
I know.

375
00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.930
<i>No way! The author of "Bloodthirsty Forensic Scientist" announced that they are taking a break.</i>

376
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.000
<i> What happened? Here, let me see.</i>

377
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.610
<i> This can't do. Come with me to the Chinese Department to look for the author named Zhou Xiao.</i>

378
00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.310
<i> How can she just stop updating?</i>

379
00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.600
<i> If she stops writing, where will I find such an interesting forensics novel?</i>

380
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.370
<i> Professor, calm down.</i>

381
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:04.240
Fanzhou, I think that someone is targeting me.

382
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.810
When we were doing the dorm inspections, you were there, too.

383
00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:12.750
I accused a girl of throwing out an electrical appliance and she might've been offended. Do you remember her?

384
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.150
I remember. It wasn't her.

385
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.910
How can you be sure it wasn't her?

386
00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:19.090
Instinct.

387
00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:21.570
I'm going to do experiments now. You go back, too.

388
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.760
When the results are out, I'll let you know.

389
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.400
Okay.

390
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.590
We're all freshmen.

391
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.400
But why am I so busy that I don't even have the time to join a club?

392
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:09.130
- Okay.
- Thank you.

393
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.340
No problem. It was nothing.

394
00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.710
If you really want to thank me, I won't mind.

395
00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.220
Come join the Badminton Club.

396
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:27.590
We can't find enough people this year. We even advertised using a badminton celebrity and it's still no use.

397
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.580
Okay, no problem. I'll come register once I'm done.

398
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.740
All right. I'll wait for you.

399
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.070
Fanzhou, I came back to drop a few things off.

400
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.160
Our Badminton Club has been recruiting all day,

401
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.110
but we barely got any new members.

402
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.590
- I guess Xie Yixing didn't really help to recruit new members. 
- Hello.

403
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.160
I'm the Xie Yixing that wasn't a huge help to you.

404
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.660
Xie Yixing! Why are you here?

405
00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:04.530
I live here.

406
00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:13.020
It's a great honor. I even want to move back in.

407
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:14.500
I'm flattered.

408
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.500
I didn't really mean what I said earlier. I'm actually your fan.

409
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.410
I was the one who put up all the posters at school.

410
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.710
Really?

411
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:26.230
I was joking earlier. You should've told me, I'm not that petty.

412
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.620
I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Chen Yu.

413
00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:31.760
I'm the president of the Badminton Club, an exchange student in the Forensic Science Department.

414
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.060
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Nice to meet you, too.

415
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.840
The development of Pre-Qin historical essays can more or less be split into three periods.

416
00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:44.230
The first period is from the Xia dynasty (c. 2070BC to 1600BC) to the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771BC to 476BC).

417
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.710
So using the "Book of History" and the "Spring and Autumn Annals" as representatives of the period;

418
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.920
in this period, historians and different branches

419
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.460
do not communicate with each other.

420
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:58.820
<i>He felt a deranged sense of fulfillment.</i>

421
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:00.840
<i> It makes a lot of sense.</i>

422
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.760
I didn't say class was dismissed yet.

423
00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.960
Classmate, you're a little too excited, aren't you?

424
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:16.100
Sorry, Professor.

425
00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:20.320
I have something urgent. Next time, I'll definitely be the last to go.

426
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:23.780
All right, class is dismissed.

427
00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.360
What's wrong with her?

428
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.480
I don't know. Maybe she's answering the call of nature?

429
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.730
We'll start class now.

430
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.780
Besides clinical forensic medicine,

431
00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.310
your criminal psychology classes will also be taught by me this year.

432
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:09.730
Aren't you guys very happy?

433
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.360
Yes.

434
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:14.170
That's a bit disappointing.

435
00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.710
It looks like I'm not that well-received.

436
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.400
Hi.

437
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.460
First, listen to class.

438
00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.850
The female student.

439
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:30.100
You're not in the Forensic Science Department, right?

440
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.870
Who let you in?

441
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:34.350
Hello, Professor.

442
00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.140
It's Zhao Fanzhou who let me in.

443
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.270
Zhao Fanzhou?

444
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.940
It's like this. I'm a detective novel lover.

445
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.790
I accidentally met Zhao Fanzhou.

446
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.990
He said that going to your class can give the composition of my detective novel

447
00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.510
the ability to enlighten people with perfect wisdom.

448
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.210
So I came because of your reputation.

449
00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:59.210
I believe you won't mind there being one more student, right?

450
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.090
Did you all hear?

451
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.960
I have quite the reputation out there.

452
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.030
I welcome you to listen. Please sit.

453
00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.190
Don't distract other students from class.

454
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.560
Got it. Thank you, Professor.

455
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.750
In the early 1970s,

456
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.970
I'll explain to you after class.

457
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:21.220
They realized a characteristic in criminal psychology that was extremely shocking.

458
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.800
The majority of killers believe themselves to be good people.

459
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.280
<i>Wow, your class is so interesting.</i>

460
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.760
I have a rush of inspiration now.

461
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.610
Let me tell you my train of thought. It's like this.

462
00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:36.620
Although the male protagonist is a murderer, his heart is very conflicted.

463
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.570
Every time he goes home after killing someone, he sobs, bangs his head against the wall, or something like that.

464
00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:43.560
So his wall has bloodstains on it.

465
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.940
The police think it's the victims' blood.

466
00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:49.800
Little did they know, it's from his own head!

467
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.480
Don't you think this plot has a lot of twists?

468
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.180
So, what is it that you came to find me for?

469
00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.400
Right, I almost forgot.

470
00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.780
I wanted to tell you that I came up with a way for you to find the hacker.

471
00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.980
<i>[Southern University Forum]</i>

472
00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:09.350
So, your idea is to go on the forums and provoke him?

473
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.530
I did a lot of research on hacker behavior.

474
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.850
Look. He chose this large of an event,

475
00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:17.140
signifying that he wants to attract people's attention.

476
00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:21.020
And from the sentence, "Your speech is garbage," you can tell that he is

477
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.180
conceited and emotional.

478
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.330
I think if we send him a declaration of war on the public forum, we can draw him out.

479
00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:31.520
Then, he'll probably leave some clues for the Programming Club to track.

480
00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.130
Then, what kind of content do you intend on sending?

481
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:38.070
I haven't thought that through yet.

482
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:39.900
Then think about it thoroughly.

483
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.660
Also, I recommend that you handwrite it and post it.

484
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:52.870
Why do I have to handwrite it? It's the 21st century. Who still handwrites things? You're so anti-environmental.

485
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:57.930
What if he also handwrites his response? Then I can do handwriting recognition.

486
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:01.640
That seems to be reasonable. But I still don't want to handwrite.

487
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.390
Why?

488
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.150
Because my handwriting is ugly.

489
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:12.960
- Write. 
 - Okay.

490
00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.080
Don't look. It really is kind of ugly.

491
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.600
Are you crazy? Yelling so suddenly.

492
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.700
Someone posted on the school's forum saying they found the hacker from the military training ceremony.

493
00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:41.600
How do I not know about that?

494
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.300
How would you know?

495
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.700
I... I don't.

496
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:52.200
Cai Yasi, are you still playing? I'm about to die.

497
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.000
I'm coming!

498
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.800
<i>I know who you are. If you don't turn yourself in tomorrow,</i>

499
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.900
<i>you will regret it. - The future Detective Club president.</i>

500
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.600
Zhou Xiao, you idiot.

501
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.200
We got a reply.

502
00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.400
What does this mean?

503
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.800
He knows you don't know his identity.

504
00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.300
I think it's an acrostic poem.

505
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.800
Can you move over a little bit?

506
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:57.400
Zhou... Xiao... You... Idiot?

507
00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.800
Why'd you curse at me?

508
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.000
This person knows you. Do you have a friend who's really good with computers?

509
00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.300
No... I don't.

510
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.400
I suddenly remembered I have something to take care of. I'll get going.

511
00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.400
Then I'll start verifying the computer science students' handwriting first.

512
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.000
How are you going to verify it?

513
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.400
The school has records of every student's signature from their enrollment.

514
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.000
The Forensics Department has an instrument to recognize handwriting.

515
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.300
Um... I'll tell you the truth.

516
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:33.000
Don't be so stubborn.

517
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Even if we found out who he was, we don't have to go catch him.

518
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.400
We can just enjoy this investigation process, isn't that enough?

519
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.800
No.

520
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.800
Fine, then I'm begging you. This really isn't that serious.

521
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.200
If we really have to, I'll go to the Student Association representative, Jia Yichun and apologize. Okay?

522
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200
You're going to apologize?

523
00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.400
So, it really was you?

524
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.600
Do you hate me that much?

525
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.200
It wasn't her. You've misunderstood.

526
00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.900
Actually...

527
00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:02.400
Just say it was me. I'll apologize.

528
00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.100
I'm sorry.

529
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.500
A simple apology is not enough.  Why on earth did you do that to me?

530
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.400
Maybe because... I'm a really petty person.

531
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.000
You... You broke my radio compass.

532
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.600
I was mad, so I wanted to get back at you.

533
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.200
I mean, we both made mistakes, can we just call it even?

534
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.100
You broke her radio compass?

535
00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.400
It was an accident.

536
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.700
I guess I misunderstood you then.

537
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.400
Sorry. I'm sincerely apologizing to you again.

538
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:38.600
You're so nice, pretty, and generous, you'll definitely forgive me. Right?

539
00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.000
I'll get going then. Bye.

540
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.800
<i>Cai Yasi, I've been waiting for half an hour already. Hurry up and come out.</i>

541
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.700
<i>Wait a little bit more. This teacher is too mean, I'm too afraid to leave.</i>

542
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:18.300
<i>You're actually afraid to do something? Hurry up and come out.</i>

543
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:27.100
<i>Just give me five more minutes, young lady.</i>

544
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:33.500
Professor, I have something to do and need to leave now.

545
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.400
Are you crazy?

546
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.600
Cai Yasi, let me tell you this. You owe me a big meal.

547
00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.400
Based on what?

548
00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.400
You're an idiot.

549
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.600
When I asked you, you kept your mouth shut. You only admitted it was you, after putting me in such a difficult situation.

550
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.000
You just apologized for me,

551
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.700
and I only hacked into that speech to get revenge for you.

552
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.500
I thought this matter would just end like this, but you insisted on getting involved.

553
00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.400
Also, did you really have to spend ¥58 on your meal? It's hard for my parents to make money, too.

554
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.000
Oh, shut up already. When you were buying your gaming equipment, why didn't you think,

555
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
"Oh, it's hard for Auntie and Uncle to make money"?

556
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.100
Besides if it wasn't for you, I would not have needed to bow my head down in front of Jia Yichun.

557
00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.400
Then I'll just go and confess. It's not that big of a deal.

558
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.400
Do you have a problem? We solved the problem already, why would you confess now?

559
00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:35.600
Hello?

560
00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.400
<i>Is this Zhou Xiao?</i>

561
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.800
That's me.

562
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.200
<i>I'm Chair Liu from the Student Affairs office. Can you come to the our office right now?</i>

563
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.800
The Student Affairs office?

564
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.000
<i>It's on the 2nd floor of the Administrative Building.</i>

565
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.800
Okay.

566
00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.600
Why did they call you to the Student Affairs office?

567
00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:54.600
I don't know. Maybe there is a problem with class selection. I keep not being able to pick my classes.

568
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.600
I'll go take a look and I'll be back soon.

569
00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.200
Don't try to take my food.

570
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:02.400
She is more protective of her food than a dog.

571
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.200
Hello? Chair Liu?

572
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:27.400
<i>Chen Yu, we've found the hacker!</i>

573
00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.800
The hacker was found?

574
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800
<i>The Student Association doesn't have to worry about this anymore.</i>

575
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.000
Hello, Chair Liu. This is Zhao Fanzhou.

576
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.800
- I thought you didn't like to interact with leadership.
- Okay.

577
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.700
I'll come over now.

578
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.500
Come in, please.

579
00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.000
What are you doing here?

580
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.900
I'm rescuing a damsel in distress.

581
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.600
Classmate Zhou Xiao.

582
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.700
You should know why I asked you here. Confess yourself.

583
00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.900
Chair, I'm the one who did it. You can stop scaring her.

584
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.600
What's going on?

585
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.600
Chair, they're good friends.

586
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:09.400
Can you not talk with such insinuations? I did it, and Zhou Xiao knew nothing about it.

587
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.600
What evidence do you have that she is innocent?

588
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:13.500
I have evidence.

589
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.590
Chair, Zhou Xiao was the one who thought to post something on the school's forum to lure the hacker out.

590
00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.500
The Programming Club has already found that the ID is the same

591
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.200
as the one on the day of the military training speech.

592
00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.000
Also, he left his handwriting online.

593
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.300
I've already finished identifying the handwriting.

594
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.400
So smart.

595
00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.800
Sorry. It looks like I misunderstood you again.

596
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.600
But you shouldn't have misled me from the start.

597
00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.800
Luckily, Fanzhou came just in time.

598
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.800
It's okay. Cai Yasi is the one who is mentally dumb.

599
00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.200
You guys all head out first.

600
00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.800
Classmate Cai, stay.

601
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.700
Okay.

602
00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:10.100
Okay, then I'll go out first.

603
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:19.600
Go. Don't worry.

604
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:22.900
Who's worried about you? You deserve it.

605
00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:29.900
Classmate Cai, come explain to me what exactly is going on with this.

606
00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.580
- President, uh...
- I have a name.

607
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.200
Zhao Fanzhou.

608
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.600
It's like this. Can you help me with something? Aren't you the Student Association President?

609
00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.200
What do you need help with?

610
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:53.600
It's just... can you talk to Chair Liu

611
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.470
and ask him to let Cai Yasi off easy?

612
00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.800
No.

613
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800
Stingy.

614
00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.800
You won't even help me with this little thing. Then I definitely won't be able to create the Detective Club.

615
00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.600
You can create it.

616
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.400
Didn't you already prove that the Detective Club has a purpose?

617
00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.200
You're right!

618
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.400
So, I'm the Detective Club president now? Yes!

619
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.060
I'm the club president, but I still can't help Cai Yasi.

620
00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.400
<i>[Preview] 
Why didn't my email for establishing a detective club receive a response?</i>

621
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.600
<i>It is not in line with regulations.</i>

622
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.700
<i>Zhou Xiao! Zhou Xiao, are you deaf?</i>

623
00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.200
<i>- I'll join. 
 - You?</i>

624
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.100
<i>I really think he's interested in you.</i>

625
00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:48.600
<i>Let me introduce everyone to our celebrity coach, Xie Yixing.</i>

626
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.000
<i>I'm trapped in the elevator. </i>

627
