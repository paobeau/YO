1
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,320

2
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,870


3
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,760
Love Is All

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,530
Episode 07
Tan Lingyin made the jar by herself
Don't trust Tang Tianyuan and make the bet with him

5
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:02,879
My lord.

6
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,000
My lord.

7
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,279
Look.

8
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:08,758
What are you doing?

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't know either.

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,360
Yuner and her mother sent this to us.

11
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
It's to thank you and adviser's help for saving their lives.

12
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:17,479
I said no.

13
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,600
But they put down the present and left.

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,390
What shall we do?

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,280
Roast duck with soy sauce.

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,240
Wait. No spicy.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,559
My lord.

18
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,080
We have a chef in our office.

19
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:38,160
If you think he's not qualified,

20
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:39,679
we can find you a new one.

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,479
When my lord was cooking,

22
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,720
he was thinking.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,190
This is the new rule of the county office.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,039
Do not disturb him.

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,399
Right.

26
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,759
It's our lucky to have such a lord 

27
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,679
who love cooking.

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,440
My lord, do whatever you want.

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,479
No one will disturb you.

30
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,160
Officer Zheng, this is out of line.

31
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,960
For our lord,

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,520
even woman can be an adviser.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,600
The rules have been already stewed as meat

34
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
by our lord.

35
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,000
Is it delicious?

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,639
Yes.

37
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,800
Yes. Yes.

38
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,839
If you are tired or hungry,

39
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:17,720
you can tell me.

40
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,080
I will cook for you every day, okay?

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,559
Thank you.

42
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,440
Okay.

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,320
Why are you eating and drinking,

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,800
and I need to transcribe the files?

45
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,320
Because you are my adviser.

46
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,639
It is your duty.

47
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,839
It smells so good.

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,320
Look, my lord.

49
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:34,960
These are all old cases.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,119
They are all closed.

51
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,960
Can I transcribe them in another day?

52
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,399
No.

53
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:44,559
There are so many tomorrows.

54
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
I quite! I want to eat!

55
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,199
Your honor said no. Don't you hear that?

56
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,199
I will sue you for abusing your subordinates.

57
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,759
Beat the imperial drum, do you understand?

58
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:55,639
If you don't,

59
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:56,600
go to find Li Dawang.

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,399
Let him teach you.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,880
It smells so good.

62
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,679
My lord.

63
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,320
Wine and animals are ready.

64
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,320
Didn't I ask you to 

65
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,399
throw them away before?

66
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:09,160
I...I...

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,240
My lord. I don't know what the monster is.

68
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,880
It kicked me out just by one kick.

69
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,279
Are your broadswords and sticks

70
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,239
just for show?

71
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,678
My lord.

72
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,558
What Xiaoliu said is all true.

73
00:04:20,559 --> 00:04:22,320
It is even more cunning

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,119
than Zhang Zhiyuan

75
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,359
of Tian Xiang Club.

76
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,040
Really? Let me have a look.

77
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,359
So cute.

78
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,359
My lord.

79
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:33,839
No way.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,679
I didn't say anything yet.

81
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:37,480
I say no even you didn't say.

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Why are you so stingy?

83
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,519
You can give it to me.

84
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:40,000
Fine.

85
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,279
In here, you and this stuff,

86
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:44,399
only one can stay. You choose.

87
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,119
But I'm a female adviser.

88
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,399
I need a bodyguard.

89
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,600
How about we give it a three-day trials?

90
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,480
Okay. But we don't need 

91
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,560
the trash who doesn't do anything but eat.

92
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,920
If you can't domesticate it in three days,

93
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,359
you'll leave with it together.

94
00:04:58,359 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't worry.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,279
I'm sure it'll be well-trained.

96
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,000
The feather is everywhere.

97
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,160
Come here.

98
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,239
You look as strong as me.

99
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,119
Then take my last name.

100
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:14,920
I'll call you Tan Baba.

101
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,300
Whatever you want to eat all my treat.

102
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,640
You can't touch this.

103
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,320
Except for this.

104
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,140
I'll cut the vegetable for you.

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,320
Wait for me.

106
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,760
Oh, no.

107
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,839
It's just a jar.

108
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,200
I'll compensate you one.

109
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,720
Compensate? How can you compensate me?

110
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,760
This old jar is a collection of the best quartz 

111
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,670
from the Kanto region,

112
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
and the best feldspar from Luoyang Xijing.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,559
It's fired by dalbergia odorifera and rosewood.

114
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,390
It's the only one in the world, the only one.

115
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,640
How can you compensate it?

116
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,359
For the past 3 years,

117
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,440
your honor only eats soup which cooked by this old jar.

118
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:08,559
Isn't it just a small jar?

119
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,610
Why so serious?

120
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,359
How can a vulgar man

121
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:13,079
know the feeling?

122
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,200
You elegant man are so hypocritical.

123
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,410
What did you say?

124
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,760
Nothing.

125
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
It's my fault. Please punish me.

126
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,700
What kind of punishment will restore this old jar?

127
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,440
It's fine.

128
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,040
Ask Xihulu to come and clean up.

129
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:36,959
Yes.

130
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't get your hand hurt.

131
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,890
It's all your fault.

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,320
So clumsily.

133
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,399
It's all your fault. Tan Baba.

134
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:09,760
Sis.

135
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:14,239
You've been up all night

136
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:15,799
just for imitating his handwriting.

137
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:16,799
This fan.

138
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:18,880
We have to sell a dozen books to get it back.

139
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,030
Does it look similar?

140
00:07:22,679 --> 00:07:23,600
Right, sis.

141
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,559
Did Magistrate Tang really know your identity?

142
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,079
He didn't blame you

143
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,799
or let you take the responsibility?

144
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,519
No.

145
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,799
It seems like he knew it long time ago.

146
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:36,600
But he said nothing.

147
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,040
He knew your real identity,

148
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,519
but he didn't blame you.

149
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:44,959
It means he knows what is the right and wrong.

150
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,279
Why do you always pick on him?

151
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,679
No, I don't.

152
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,839
Just a fan.

153
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:52,480
Besides.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,600
I'm imitating Tong Tianyuan's signature.

155
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,760
Not him, Tang Feilong.

156
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,359
Why will he be angry?

157
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:01,799
When I've made enough money,

158
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,440
I'll go back to the capital,

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,959
and find Tang Tianyuan.

160
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,970
What are you thinking?

161
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,519
I didn't expect that

162
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,000
out adviser Tan is Miaomiaosheng.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,190
Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt its debtor.

164
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,839
May I ask how will you punish her?

165
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,640
Punish her.

166
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,279
We just find out the truth of the Qi Hui's case.

167
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:30,040
And the origin of the bad gold has not been found yet.

168
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,720
I don't have time to think about that.

169
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,670
You always have a point.

170
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,860
How's the investigation I asked you to do?

171
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,000
Assistant Zhou, he is clear.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
As he said,

173
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,039
he has waited for years

174
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,440
to take this position.

175
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
About adviser Tan's situation,

176
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,039
you know much better than me.

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,080
The same as your Baba.

178
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,640
My Baba?

179
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:51,679
It's her Baba!

180
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,239
So should we keep investigating?

181
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
I think the most important thing right now

182
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,080
is to find out the truth of the gold mine case.

183
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,359
Miss.

184
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,320
Look at this one.

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,400
Fine texture, exquisite workmanship.

186
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,080
It's even unique in Tongling.

187
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,719
Do you like it?

188
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,559
If you don't like them all,

189
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,640
then we have no more good stuff.

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
Thank you.

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,599
Come again.

192
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,359
Have a look.

193
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,320
Please have a look.

194
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,359
Here you are.

195
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,280
I'm here.

196
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,159
Find out what the relationship

197
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,760
between the female adviser and Tang Feilong is.

198
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,080
Adviser Tan.

199
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,479
Fresh vegetables.

200
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
You are?

201
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,640
Why are you so upset?

202
00:09:57,599 --> 00:09:58,520
What can I help you?

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,039
There's something wrong with this gold.

204
00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,520
What? Do you think it's too little?

205
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:13,760
As the saying goes,

206
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,880
70% is cyan; 80% is yellow; 95% is red. This is cyan.

207
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,960
We can barely call it gold.

208
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,280
What's wrong with it?

209
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:25,280
The gold color made by the court

210
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,400
should not be like this.

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,039
Only those small workshops from underclass

212
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,440
will make something like this

213
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,950
because they don't have the skills.

214
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,239
Underclass?

215
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,350
You mean

216
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,700
what Sun Bufan said is true.

217
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,750
Qi Hui and Sun Bufan are both from rich families.

218
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,880
I don't think they will use somthing like this

219
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,700
to fool people.

220
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:43,719
Right.

221
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,039
Speaking of the gold,

222
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,479
only adviser Tan cares about it the most.

223
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,239
By the way, how about her bookstore?

224
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,320
It is really good.

225
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,350
Anything related to earn money,

226
00:10:56,359 --> 00:10:58,200
every sec is important for our adviser.

227
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
Right. When the Qi Hui's case is closed,

228
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,640
the Volume One of Detective Series has come out.

229
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:05,559
I have to say that

230
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,159
our adviser Tan does things in moderation.

231
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,950
She didn't mention anything that she shouldn't in the novel.

232
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:11,359
But she said a lot of words 

233
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,719
to praise you.

234
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,960
Isn't it all true?

235
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,919
You must feel sweet now.

236
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:20,880
Right.

237
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,000
The Gutang Bookstore is in a competition.

238
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,080
Turns out the fairy girl

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
who officer Zheng talks about is you.

240
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
Just call me Ruyi.

241
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,880
Although officer Zheng is careless,

242
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,440
he's serious to relationship.

243
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,719
You are so kind

244
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,080
to make a jar by yourself.

245
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,670
It's my fault to break the jar.

246
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,080
I need to compensate him a new one.

247
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,120
Magistrate Tang cares about it so much.

248
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,200
I searched all over Tongling.

249
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
And I didn't find any good five-color porcelain.

250
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,440
Actually the clay of the old jar is not expensive.

251
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,039
It's just not easy to find.

252
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:55,000
But there's a kind of clay on top of Mount Tianmu.

253
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,440
Although the quality is not as good as this,

254
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,280
if it's fired properly,

255
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,510
it will probably be 70% to 80% similar to the original one.

256
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,479
Really?

257
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,559
Did you know each other in the capital?

258
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,559
Gem!

259
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:14,760
We are so lucky.

260
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,159
Good.

261
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,190
Nice to see you here.

263
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,000
The Couplet Competition, sponsored by Gutang Bookstore,

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,119
will begin.

265
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,200
Please come on stage.

266
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,599
Okay.

267
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:33,030
This is our first line.

268
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,280
The phoenix falls on the sycamore, 

269
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,880
the sycamore falls on the phoenix.

270
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,039
This is the competition you said?

271
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,960
Yes. The literature competition is also a competition.

272
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,479
I'll do it.

273
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,760
A pearl joins a jade and a jade joins a pearl.

274
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,119
Good.

275
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,300
The mountains are linked by water and the moon, 

276
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,880
the water is linked by mountains.

277
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,919
Good.

278
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,320
The boat follows the tide, 

279
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,320
the waves follow the boat.

280
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,760
Good.

281
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,300
the wind shakes the willow flakes, 

282
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,350
the willow shakes the wind.

283
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:11,400
Good.

284
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,560
That's our Tongling's top four talents.

285
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,340
They're all the same.

286
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:18,960
Not only your second lines are similar,

287
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,359
but also your preference.

288
00:13:20,359 --> 00:13:22,719
They're all fans sold by our Gutang Bookstore.

289
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,280
Of course.

290
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,359
My lord.

291
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:36,719
Assistant Zhou?

292
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,150
I think the Sun Bufan's case

293
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,230
needs to be opened again.

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,799
Then what do you think?

295
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,159
You should remember my mistake.

296
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,640
If I had given the hosts the convenience,

297
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,760
I will not be a little assistant in a small country.

298
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,960
I regret it all the time, my lord.

299
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,200
You are new here and has no foundation.

300
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,320
If you want to be a good magistrate,

301
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
the most important thing is

302
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,440
be nice with the nobles of the county.

303
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:07,239
Why don't you give convenience 

304
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:08,559
to landlord Sun by this case?

305
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm sure he will be grateful to you.

306
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,039
But Sun Bufan confessed to killing a man

307
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,000
in front of everyone.

308
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,799
It is hard to 

309
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,920
appeal against his conviction.

310
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,119
This.

311
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,239
Sun Bufan killed her for a reason.

312
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,470
Please send him into exile instead of the death penalty .

313
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,479
And he can wait for the pardon.

314
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:34,590
It is okay.

315
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,900
How much did you get from them?

316
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,520
My lord.

317
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,320
How do you know?

318
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,479
I did receive some money.

319
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:50,880
But all I considered is for you.

320
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,880
If you think I'm wrong,

321
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,479
I will give you half of the money.

322
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,340
Two hundred taels.

323
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,050
Four hundred taels.

324
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,000
This number is bad.

325
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,080
My father is sick.

326
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,080
And my mother is old.

327
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,440
Fine. I won't take yours.

328
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,080
Did you see adviser?

329
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,159
No.

330
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,719
Find her.

331
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:22,799
Tell her to come to the study.

332
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:47,679
Mr. Tan?

333
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,820
You haven't slept yet.

334
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,710
What are you doing?

335
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,679
My sister wants to watch fireworks.

336
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,599
I'll make one for her.

337
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,370
Do you know how to do it?

338
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,039
Just follow instructions in the book.

339
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:05,400
Mr. Tan, you are so kind.

340
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,080
No matter what sister Lingyin wants,

341
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,400
you can make them for her.

342
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:13,359
My lord!

343
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,230
Where have you been to earn money?

344
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:19,760
What do you mean?

345
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,440
Seems like you take huge advantages of my fan.

346
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,359
You knew it.

347
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,000
But that is fake.

348
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,400
So.

349
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,799
You admit you copied my fan.

350
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,620
It's enough to pass off the fake as the real thing, right?

351
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,719
Why?

352
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,280
Paintings of masters will be imitated 

353
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,799
by future generations sooner or later.

354
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,320
I was just one step ahead.

355
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,479
It's not upright to make a fake.

356
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,410
Good things should be shared with each other.

357
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,000
The fan with you

358
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,359
only makes you happy.

359
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,799
And now, everyone is happy.

360
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:56,840
You are so cunning.

361
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,660
I make money on my own way.

362
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:00,960
You only care about the money.

363
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,680
I don't wanna talk with you now.

364
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,479
If I only care about the money,

365
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:11,560
why should I give you this?

366
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,839
Little Huang also needs a drinking bowl.

367
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,310
This is perfect for it.

368
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll give you the fan back tomorrow.

369
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,839
Save it to yourself.

370
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,010
I will not take back the thing I give.

371
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,520
What's wrong with you and adviser?

372
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,640
How should I know?

373
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,590
I just broke a jar. Why is she so angry?

374
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:55,599
The jar.

375
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:58,079
Adviser has been working hard for days 

376
00:17:58,079 --> 00:17:59,680
to make this jar.

377
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,839
You. You just broke it like that?

378
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,850
She made it herself?

379
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,560
There's only one woman in our office.

380
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,460
You should go to the bookstore more often,

381
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,900
and take more care of adviser's daily activities.

382
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,800
That's a pity.

383
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,300
Do not step on it.

384
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,640
I need to glue it up.

385
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,680
I really don't understand you.

386
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,520
I will leave now.

387
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,719
Come in.

388
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
Qingchen, you can't sleep at night?

389
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,820
Aren't you the one who's not sleeping?

390
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,140
My lord?

391
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,830
I will take you to a place.

392
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Take me here to work in the midnight.

393
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,239
I am your adviser!

394
00:19:21,239 --> 00:19:22,599
I am not your Muskmelon.

395
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,140
Are you still mad at me?

396
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
How dare I am?

397
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,820
Don't worry.

398
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:32,800
My bookstore is over there. I won't run away.

399
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,359
I'll pay you back

400
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:35,520
all the money of selling fans.

401
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,079
I want cash.

402
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,040
Normally, a man would just wave his hand

403
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,400
and say, "No, that's okay".

404
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,850
It's what you said to pay me back all the money. 

405
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:47,439
Incense bags.

406
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,880
You're out of line.

407
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
Good-look incense bags.

408
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,439
Here you are.

409
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,359
I didn't know you made that jar by yourself.

410
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,010
Sorry.

411
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,920
It's me who broke your jar.

412
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,170
I should compensate you another.

413
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,130
But that one was broken.

414
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,199
I can't fix it anymore.

415
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,839
So I can only go to Mount Tianmu,

416
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,119
get some mud and make one for you.

417
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:43,640
You dug up the mud yourself?

418
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,119
Lady Zhou went there with me.

419
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,719
She's the beauty who officer zheng talked about.

420
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:11,719
I heard you want to go to the capital?

421
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,280
I want to go to the capital and see my Tang Tianyuan.

422
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:18,599
And then?

423
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,760
Say "thank you" to him.

424
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,560
That's it?

425
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,680
Didn't you say you wanna marry him?

426
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,160
I am a self-aware person,

427
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,800
okay?

428
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,640
So the novel this time you wrote

429
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:34,439
is still about him.

430
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,560
No. It's the story about you.

431
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,520
About what?

432
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,040
Don't be conceited.

433
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,719
I just use your life story

434
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,400
for convenience.

435
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,680
It's on fire!

436
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,280
It's on fire over there?!

437
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,040
Where is it?

438
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,079
What is going on?

439
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,280
It's on fire. Put out the fire.

440
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
Come on. Put out the fire.

441
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,160
What is going on?

442
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,239
It's on fire.

443
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:03,280
Put out the fire.

444
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
Come on.

445
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,760
Are you okay?

446
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,199
I'm fine. Sis. Don't worry.

447
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:12,680
It's just the gunpowder exploded.

448
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Why do you make gunpowder?

449
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,959
Didn't expect that your brother

450
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,719
had a hobby for inventions.

451
00:22:17,719 --> 00:22:18,560
No.

452
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,719
It's because there's a popular romance novel said that

453
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,880
men and women need an atmosphere to get along.

454
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,230
And no woman could refuse a man

455
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,860
who would set off fireworks for her.

456
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,599
Bullshit.

457
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,520
Don't believe this crap.

458
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Are you really okay?

459
00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:38,359
The house burned down like this.

460
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,640
How about you live in the office?

461
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:40,810
Really?

462
00:22:42,199 --> 00:22:43,760
Then what about my brother?

463
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,719
Sis, I can stay at hotel.

464
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:46,160
It's for free.

465
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:48,719
Together.

466
00:22:48,719 --> 00:22:51,520
What about Fang and Zhuang?

467
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,040
The West Room is huge.

468
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,880
Thank you, my lord!

469
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,000
What's this?

470
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:16,400
Chicken soup?

471
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,430
My lord. It's been over one night.

472
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,560
Can't eat it anymore.

473
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,790
Autumn is coming. And it's cold now.

474
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,160
It's not that perishable.

475
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,040
Warm it up then send back.

476
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,920
My lord.

477
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,990
You never eat any overnight dish.

478
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:36,640
It's soup, not a dish.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,520
Go.

480
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,880
Yes.

481
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,439
My lord, have some plum juice.

482
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:03,599
Hey guys! What's wrong with you?

483
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,439
Didn't I pay you?

484
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:09,110
Cry louder, louder!

485
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,000
Do you hear that?

486
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,839
That was scary.

487
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:16,400
My lord.

488
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,400
How many times did I tell you.

489
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,640
Don't yell.

490
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:29,560
And don't be too hard also.

491
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,520
We're not here to sing.

492
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,920
What are we doing here?

493
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,479
We're here to collect a debt.

494
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,080
I'll say it again. Listen carefully.

495
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,760
Concentrate the drool on the throat.

496
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,959
On the throat.

497
00:24:41,959 --> 00:24:44,479
Follow me. One, two.

498
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,920
Right.

499
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,880
My daughter.

500
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:54,680
What are you doing?

501
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,660
They're gonna beat us! 

502
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,350
The murderer's father is gonna beat us!

503
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:01,000
What's wrong with you?

504
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,760
My daughter will never come back.

505
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,280
I still have a disappointing son to raise.

506
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,119
My daughter, you just left.

507
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,439
When you're in Hades,

508
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:20,079
you must sue him.

509
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,319
Let Yama keep an eye on their family.

510
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,359
And make sure they'll die...

511
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,319
My lord. My lord.

512
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:28,119
Die painfully.

513
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,880
My lord, how about we just blow them away?

514
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,839
How?!

515
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,500
Do you think the young master is not guilty enough?!

516
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,640
My lord. My lord.

517
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,240
We've known each other for decades.

518
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,830
Stop acting.

519
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:50,719
The bureau for foreign shipping now needs a young director.

520
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,239
Your son is on the right age.

521
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,839
He's been sailing for years. You can ask him to come.

522
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:58,239
I'll give him this position. What do you think?

523
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,359
Just wake up.

524
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,760
Get me up.

525
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:10,319
What are you doing?

526
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,479
Wait. Wait.

527
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,560
My daughter was killed by your son.

528
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,599
I feel so painful. It really hurts.

529
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,839
Ridiculous. For your daughter?

530
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,520
If you do this for your daughter,

531
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,640
you should be in the county office now,

532
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,239
and ask Tang Feilong kill my son.

533
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,199
Are you here to get justice for your daughter?

534
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,199
You're looking for a way out for your son.

535
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:43,319
The county office is also a place of humanity.

536
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,800
I can apply for interceding as the father of Qi Hui.

537
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,280
Then Bufan can continue to

538
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,040
do filial piety to you.

539
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,230
Now you say something like a human.

540
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,140
Now you can tell me

541
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,359
if you'll be able to help 

542
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,680
my son take the position of bureau.

543
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,520
Of course.

544
00:27:08,199 --> 00:27:12,280
The point is if you can let it over.

545
00:27:16,479 --> 00:27:19,400
My lord, vent one is hatred better than create more enemy!

546
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,119
Besides, we were friends for long time.

547
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,160
We're like a real family with each other, right?

548
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,359
Yes, my lord.

549
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,239
My lord.

550
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,199
Our families are going to rebuild our relationship.

551
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,959
Yes. We are now a family again.

552
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,800
Now, his daughter is gone.

553
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,599
Doesn't that mean

554
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,520
my daughter's gone?

555
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:54,079
Now my son Bufan,

556
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:57,880
if he is also gone,

557
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,400
then

558
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,560
it means your son is also gone, right?

559
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:01,800
Isn't it?

560
00:28:06,479 --> 00:28:08,040
I can understand your feelings.

561
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:10,599
But why does it sound

562
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,839
like I killed your children?

563
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,280
I dare not.

564
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:18,000
Look.

565
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:22,959
This is a little gift.

566
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,599
My lord. What do you think?

567
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:41,479
But that is your daughter.

568
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:43,280
Right.

569
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,160
But my lord.

570
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,760
Bufan.

571
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,880
I've watched him growing up.

572
00:28:53,479 --> 00:28:55,359
He is just like my half-son.

573
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,640
My daughter is already gone.

574
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,400
My daughter.

575
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,119
What's wrong, brother?!

576
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:05,680
Brother!

577
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,650
Brother. Are you okay, my brother?!

578
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,230
Impudence!

579
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:14,479
It is my duty to enforce the law impartially.

580
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,800
But if you get out of the county office,

581
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,439
and you still think I manage this county well,

582
00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,599
work the case hard,

583
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,400
It's not too late

584
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:32,319
to give me these gold.

585
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,400
Thanks, my lord.

586
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:38,800
We understand.

587
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,950
The money from selling fans are all here.

588
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,980
You can count yourself.

589
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,199
Don't you wanna restructure your bookstore?

590
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,840
Take it.

591
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,199
I don't wanna use your money.

592
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:01,960
Dirty money.

593
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,040
What you said to landlord Sun,

594
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,119
I heard them all.

595
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:10,000
Landlord Qi asked for reconciliation.

596
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,400
So everything's ready now but my permission.

597
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,839
So you can lose your conscience,

598
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,160
take bribes and bend the law?

599
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,199
The case hasn't closed. I can't tell you anything.

600
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:21,119
You don't have to.

601
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,880
Now you are a corrupt official

602
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
in my heart.

603
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:26,640
I'll gather the evidence,

604
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,110
go to the capital and prosecute you. Wait for it.

605
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,510
Come back.

606
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:33,920
I, Tan Lingyin,

607
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,479
won't come back just because you tell me to.

608
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,719
Didn't you just come back?

609
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:38,479
Just for once.

610
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:42,760
Do you dare make a bet with me, Tan Lingyin?

611
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,319
For what?

612
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,359
If I can find a way to

613
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,040
not to offend landlord Sun,

614
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
and send Sun Bufan to the jail,

615
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,320
you need to promise me one condition.

616
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,040
A person who worships the golden calf like you.

617
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,000
How can I trust you?

618
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,680
Why do you talk so much?

619
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,760
Do you dare to bet or not?

620
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,479
Sure. Why not?!

621
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:07,479
If Sun Bufan can be executed,

622
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:09,040
I'll do whatever you want from now on.

623
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,800
But if you are gonna let him off the hook

624
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,560
for corruption,

625
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,479
you need to pay me double the gold he gave you.

626
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:14,920
Okay?

627
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,680
Okay.

628
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,400
But if you lose,

629
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,439
you need to pay me double.

630
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:23,040
Also, you need to say 3 words to me

631
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,480
in front of the whole county.

632
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,540
Say what?

633
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:31,319
My lord.

634
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,000
Are you...

635
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,319
Which three words do you think?

636
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,439
It's...

637
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,319
This is embarrassing. I can't say it.

638
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,830
If you lose,

639
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,400
say it to me

640
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,690
in front of everyone.

641
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,360
Do you wanna play fire?

642
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,439
Sure, I'm not afraid.

643
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,260
You're curious about that too.

644
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,710
I'm afraid you and your brother

645
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,390
will blow up the whole Tongling County again.

646
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,060
Is it that hard to be honest?

647
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,640
Don't you just have nothing to do?

648
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,240
Right.

649
00:32:31,479 --> 00:32:33,000
Do you really think Sunjie's gold

650
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,040
is in Mount Tianmu?

651
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:36,280
Maybe.

652
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,599
Then shouldn't we 

653
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,040
ask landlord Sun for something?

654
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,000
Ask what? The bet is not done yet.

655
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
It's too early to say anything.

656
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:48,280
If you have a way to balance Sun and Qi families

657
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,839
and win the bet,

658
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:52,680
why are you playing fire with me here?

659
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:54,520
Right.

660
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,570
Bring me that paper and writing brush.

661
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,319
For what?

662
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,560
Write the bet.

663
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:05,400
I'm afraid someone will deny if she lose.

664
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,439
Whatever. I'm not afraid.

665
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,760
You know you will lose, but you still wanna bet.

666
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,079
Is this a trap?

667
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,560
You won't come back anymore.

668
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:32,319
Now you're dead.

669
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,359
Don't blame me for paving the way for your brother.

670
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,000
Please bless your brother that his official career will be successful.

671
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,560
And blessing your father

672
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,000
goes smoothly.

673
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:49,560
Hui'er.

674
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,800
My lord, the carriage is ready.

675
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm going.

676
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,840
I don't know

677
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,360
how much I owe my ungrateful son

678
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,280
in my life.

679
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,120
Recalling sad things is not good for your health.

680
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,879
You should take care of yourselves.

681
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,600
Brother, how about this.

682
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,360
Your daughter is died now.

683
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:32,080
No, she's not died. She will always be in my heart.

684
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,360
From now on,

685
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,040
our family Sun will always take your daughter

686
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,800
as my son's wife.

687
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,879
My son will always be your son-in-law.

688
00:34:44,438 --> 00:34:47,279
He'll do everything he can for your family.

689
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,080
What do you think?

690
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:49,800
Right.

691
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,399
Son-in-law. Good son-in-law.

692
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,360
Let's toast to Magistrate Tang.

693
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,439
Okay. Okay. Okay.

694
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:05,520
I don't drink.

695
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,760
But don't worry.

696
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
This case still has another way to deal with it.

697
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,679
Tang Feilong.

698
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:18,560
I'll record it all!

699
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:22,479
My lord. I have something to report.

700
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,040
What's wrong with you? Is there any outsider here?

701
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,879
My lord, this.

702
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:30,399
Just say it.

703
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,199
This inspector's team

704
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,199
has sent a handwriting order of the imperial envoy.

705
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:36,919
Imperial envoy?

706
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,879
Imperial envoy is coming.

707
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,239
My lord.

708
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:54,840
My lord.

709
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:02,439
It says

710
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,800
the imperial envoy

711
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,280
received anonymous report

712
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,199
that I received a heavy bribe

713
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,230
and have collusion with merchant.

714
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,420
It also says that

715
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,719
Qi Hui's case

716
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,270
will be reported to the capital for rehearing.

717
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,270
