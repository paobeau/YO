00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.660
Do you miss me?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.780
Of course I do.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.140
What brings you here?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.260
Come over here.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.030
Come.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.660
I think you should have a rest.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.310
We're getting married.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.820
But you've been buried in work these days.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.900
Aren't you the same?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.860
You write novels through the night.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.590
It's not the same thing.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.780
I thought your dad suggested

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.020
we shouldn't see each other three days
before our wedding.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.500
OK, I'm leaving.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.420
What are you doing?

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.740
Get up. You're so heavy.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.580
Nope.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.030
I need to ask you something important.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.700
What is it?

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.140
Did you find your best man?

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.340
Look at me. Look at me.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.150
Your mom is pushing me on it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.400
Just tell me.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.980
Can you find anyone else besides Xie Yixing?

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.580
Hey, you...

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.680
I'm so sleepy.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.220
So you really can't find anyone else?

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.340
I just knew it.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.340
This is the part

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.580
where I show you

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.020
how resourceful I am.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.500
Who should I contact?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.900
Cai Yasi.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.100
Good day, Mr. Cai.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.660
Good day.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.060
What's up?

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.540
It's me, Zhao Fanzhou.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:42.980
I can see you.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.710
We're getting married.
We want you to be the best man.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.400
OK.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.780
How come you promised without hesitation?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.630
It's like you don't have
anything better to do.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.700
How come you asked me to be your best man?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.740
It's like you don't have any friends.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.260
At least I have a girlfriend.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.120
Well, that's because

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.380
love is complicated for me.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.540
It takes time to sort it out.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.870
Alright.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.580
Thank you in advance. Bye!

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.280
Bye!

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.140
Good day, Mr. Cai.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.900
What are you doing?

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.500
I'm sleeping.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.680
You're gonna sleep alone.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.220
I'm going back home.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.820
My dad is looking for me.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.000
I don't care.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.310
We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.750
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.950
here comes the bride!

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.020
It's your

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.260
wedding day

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.270
and you chose to put two skeletons
at the entrance.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.940
Your mom and mother-in-law

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.420
just let you.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.360
Don't you think it's absurd?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.100
It's my wedding day.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.420
Is it proper for you to scold me

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:35.360
while we're walking down the aisle?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.220
Is it proper for you
to talk back at this moment?

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.180
I can't believe you're scolding me
even on this occasion.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.940
I'm so happy that you get married.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.260
That's a big relief for me.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.220
Well, don't regret

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.500
if I never come back to visit you.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.620
Don't make me kick your ass.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.700
Lijuan,

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.260
I'm so lucky

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.580
to have Zhou Xiao

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:57.700
as my daughter-in-law.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.860
You did a good job raising her.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:00.940
It's nice of you to say it.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.820
Your son is very brilliant, too.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.500
Well,

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.340
I've never seen him so handsome.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.220
He always looks handsome.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.830
The bride is standing there.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.860
Now, the bridegroom

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.460
is walking to his beautiful bride.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.020
Dad,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.040
if you keep doing this,

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.100
I'll call off the wedding

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.820
and go back with you.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.580
Mr. Zhou.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.580
What did you call me?

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:40.390
Dad.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.340
Oh my god, look, look.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.420
My husband is about to cry.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.340
It's only natural that a father

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.860
has complicated feelings
at his daughter's wedding.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.500
Just so you know, I'm good at martial arts.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.500
Point taken, dad.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.100
I'll take good care of Zhou Xiao.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.260
Come back home whenever you want.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.430
Call and tell us

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.830
whatever dishes you want to have.

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:32.620
You have my blessing.

Girls, I'm gonna throw the bouquet.

One!

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.260
Two!

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:25.980
Three!

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.550
Alright, alright.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:33.870
One!

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:35.340
Two!

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.440
Three!

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.700
Zhou Xiao.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:39.960
Fanzhou,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.120
your wife is so mischievous!

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:46.980
I'm not gonna grab it.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.340
Wei.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:00.700
Wei, you'll get married next.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.900
But I don't want it.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:06.910
Do you want it?

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:08.540
No, no, no.

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.980
I'll leave it to someone who needs it.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.180
Destiny never gives people what they want,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.740
just like fat meat never knocks
on the door of the skinny ones.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.300
Did Tao Ling find a job in her hometown?

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.860
Is she single?

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.630
Zhou Xiao said

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:22.910
she returned to her hometown
where she found a job

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:23.820
and got promoted.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.700
And if she is single...

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.260
Why do you ask about it?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.180
It's just to show concern.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.000
I've been single all this time.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.100
No one has expressed concern to me.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.460
That's not cool.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:38.340
You guys know that I need the bouquet
to pop the question.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.740
You deserve it!

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.670
She accepted your proposal
right after graduation.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:44.940
It's been two years
and you're still not married.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.020
I don't think it's gonna happen.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.740
I'll marry you.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.580
It's only that I'm not sure

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.020
about the timing yet.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.630
Give me some time to think about it.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.500
Lu,

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.420
take it.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.740
I don't want it.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.660
I don't want it.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.020
I don't want it.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:09.020
Don't throw my bouquet like that.

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.500
Give it to me.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.340
Wow, so much money.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.740
I'm back.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.390
What took you so long?

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.580
I thought you were
driving my parents home.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.140
I had some shots with dad.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.460
Some shots?

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.080
Yes.

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.340
Come over here. Don't move.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:47.340
What's up?

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.620
How much did you drink?

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:51.660
Not so much.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.660
I'm taking a shower.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.180
Store the red packets.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:14:59.660
OK.

00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:01.780
Not so much.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.700
And one more thing.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.870
Call my parents.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.340
They were looking for you.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:11.740
OK.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.740
Tell them that you are back.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.700
OK.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:44.870
OK.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.100
Yes.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:56.740
Dad.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.790
He's drunk again.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.260
I agree about

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.340
everything you said.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:03.780
But,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.060
you're not perfect as well.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:10.460
Tell me about it.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.150
First of all,

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:14.660
your sleeping position is really bad.

00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:18.620
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:20.820
What are you talking about?

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:22.460
Son,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.660
I give you credit

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.700
for your keen observation.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.260
Thanks, mom.

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:29.060
But I want to tell you,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.420
please don't

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.660
spank my wife anymore.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.380
Let's try to work things out.

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:38.180
Violence is not a solution.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.630
Do you think you can get rid of it?

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:42.260
I didn't spank her. I was bluffing.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.340
And dad,

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.620
from now on,

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.320
when Zhou Xiao

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:49.780
is sleeping,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.700
please don't force her to get up.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.180
Let her get some sleep.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.380
It's very tiring to write a novel.

00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:02.860
Well, I...

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:05.620
Alright, alright.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:07.980
I'm so sorry.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.980
I've never seen him

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:10.830
so drunk.

00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.740
It's alright.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.460
That's right. It's a happy occasion.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.620
He never touches wine.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.980
Dad,

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.780
if you want mom back,

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:20.300
just be straight about it.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.020
Don't

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.460
be shy.

00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.500
It's not like me at all.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:26.700
Son,

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:28.700
let's talk about it another time.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.510
You're drunk. Go to bed early.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.540
Where is Zhou Xiao?

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.140
Put her on the phone.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.780
What's up?

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:38.540
Nope.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.460
Why?

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.100
Because

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.070
she is mine.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.220
What?

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:50.400
He hung it up.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:50.940
He hung it up.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.270
This kid...

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.920
Well.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.340
That's right. We're all tired.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:03.220
Have more drink.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:04.500
I'm good.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.540
He's good.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.180
He's good.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.340
Let's call it a day.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.180
Everyone is exhausted.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.980
Have a good rest.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.740
We'll enjoy the wine tomorrow.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:12.240
OK.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:13.380
Have a good rest.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.830
We will.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:16.820
Have a good rest.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.110
This way. Go upstairs.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.220
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:21.460
I'm here.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.900
You're drunk.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.500
I order you to go to bed right now.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.380
Nope.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.340
I don't want to sleep.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.820
Why?

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.380
You're so drunk.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.660
Drunk.

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:35.900
Because,

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.620
because

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:38.480
I'm hungry.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.060
But it's middle of the night.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.550
We don't have any food in the house.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.340
Have some peanuts and jujube.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.900
That's the only thing

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.200
we get tonight.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.460
They are special food.

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.540
They have a special meaning.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.500
I know. It's about good luck
in having a baby.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.100
What are you doing?

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.180
To

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:18.940
have

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.020
a baby.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:22.780
Zhao Fanzhou!

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.020
Darling, don't move.

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.260
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.980
you're on my hair!
