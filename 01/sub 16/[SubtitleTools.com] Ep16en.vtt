(Previously on Episode 15)

16
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.260
Apologize to Lu.

17
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.460
Apologize to her!

18
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.020
Will you go on a date with me?

19
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.580
Like I said, I won't disappoint you.

20
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.260
Hold on tight. Here we go.

21
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.860
Because I only heard the word "kiss".

(Episode 16: Help for Depression)

23
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.820
I did it for your good.

24
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.220
Don't be mad.

25
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.060
Lu.

26
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.460
Don't blame Zhou Xiao.

27
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.100
I'm the person tagging along shamelessly.

28
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.500
Now that we are here,

29
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.460
we should have fun.

30
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060
(Nancheng Lefang Amusement Park)

31
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.460
If this proves to be boring,

32
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.700
you can kick my ass in our dorm room.

33
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.220
Come on. Let's go.

34
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.780
Come on.

35
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.700
Go. Go. Go.

36
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.700
We should get going too.

37
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.540
Yeah. Go.

38
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.860
Lu, your shoes look so nice.

39
00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.460
Let's go to Lu.

40
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.020
We'll have fun without them.

41
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.820
You are right.

42
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.180
We shouldn't be their third wheel.

43
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.740
I have to say

44
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.220
you are quite perceptive.

45
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.460
I don't want them to be our third wheel.

46
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.740
Let me carry your bag.

47
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.300
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.500
What are you doing?

49
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.380
Have you got a brick in your bag?

50
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.580
Yes.

51
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.820
It's used to smash your face.

52
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.140
Why would you carry such a heavy bag

53
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.700
when you want to have fun outdoors?

54
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.300
I came here directly
from my classroom after school.

55
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.380
Let me carry your bag.

56
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.340
Thanks.

57
00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:39.940
Hurry.

58
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.980
Look. Look. Look.

59
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.860
Look at that house.

60
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.740
How colorful it is.

61
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.940
Its appearance can make people feel better.

62
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.660
What do you think?

63
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.300
It's okay.

64
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.060
Are you feeling better now?

65
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.940
I'm fine.

66
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.580
Look. Look.

67
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.140
Look at that roller coaster.

68
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.660
Look how curved the lines are.

69
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.260
Do you feel an urge

70
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.420
to jump up?

71
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.460
It's okay.

72
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.420
Look. Look.

73
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.460
How joyous and happy

74
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.980
that little girl's smile is.

75
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.300
What are you doing?

76
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.420
Stop scaring that kid.

77
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.860
I'm leaving.

78
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.780
Where are you going?

79
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.500
What flavor do you want for your ice cream?

80
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:35.380
Yogurt.

81
00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.460
One cantaloupe ice cream
and one yogurt ice cream.

82
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.220
Thanks.

83
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.980
I thought you liked cantaloupe ice cream.

84
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.460
I want to try a new flavor.

85
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.500
So sour.

86
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.420
It's sour, right?

87
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.740
Your tolerance for sourness is high.

88
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.660
What shall we play first?

89
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.380
What shall we play?

90
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.220
The roller coaster.

91
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.100
Listen.

92
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.100
Their screams sounded so happy.

93
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.500
More like frightened.

94
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.540
No way.

95
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.940
Think about it. Their voices

96
00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.180
were raised in joy.

97
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.820
Hello. There's no empty seat now.

98
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.860
Please wait for the next ride.

99
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.780
Sorry.

100
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.700
I'll take a ride first.

101
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.700
Don't leave me alone.

102
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.860
Have no fear.

103
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.060
It's safe.

104
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.380
I'm not afraid.

105
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.980
Not afraid?

106
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.380
You call that "not afraid"?

107
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.580
Zhao Fanzhou, open your eyes and look.

108
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.180
Take a rest.

109
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:15.980
This is it.

110
00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.300
Sharpshooter.

111
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.340
Men's game.

112
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.340
To tell you the truth,

113
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.180
this is the game I'm best at.

114
00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.340
Also,

115
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.460
this is the game for venting.

116
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.820
Are you ready for my charm?

117
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:40.820
How about that?

118
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.940
If I weren't such a good badminton player,

119
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.740
I would enroll in a shooting team.

120
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.220
Madam.

121
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.060
I'm done.

122
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.780
Alright.

123
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.540
Good shots.

124
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.780
Here. This is your prize.

125
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.500
Thanks.

126
00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.540
Indeed, you are a sharpshooter.

127
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.140
All your shots hit the other guy's marks.

128
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.940
It distresses the shooting team

129
00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.260
to lose someone like you.

130
00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.900
I haven't done this in a while.

131
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.900
I've grown a little rusty.

132
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.740
Take it over.

133
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.300
Generally, girls

134
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.980
who are new to this game

135
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:23.940
can't aim correctly.

136
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.660
There's nothing shameful
about missing the marks.

137
00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:27.460
Do you know
what the three points and one line are?

138
00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.220
Lu.

139
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.300
Well done.

140
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.860
You must have practiced before.

141
00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:42.620
Come on.

142
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:43.460
The orange one up there.

143
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.260
The red one on the third row.

144
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:50.940
The blue one at the bottom.

145
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:51.820
The one in the bottom right corner.

146
00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:54.740
Come on.

147
00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.500
The bottom row.

148
00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.220
The whole row.

149
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:00.220
All hits.

150
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.180
Amazing.

151
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.340
Blow up 30 balloons

152
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.220
and we'll win the special prize.

153
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:04.860
The special prize.

154
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.700
I want the special prize.

155
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:06.980
Go get it.

156
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:07.660
Hit the red one.

157
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.260
The red one.

158
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.500
Can you be quiet?

159
00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.700
This looks good.

160
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.460
Zhao Fanzhou.

161
00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.980
You were so funny.

162
00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.620
Mister.

163
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.780
I want this picture printed.

164
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.820
Two copies.

165
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.140
I didn't know this side of you...

166
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.020
Why are you walking so fast? Wait for me.

167
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:47.860
Mister, hurry up.

168
00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:48.580
Print this picture.

169
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.060
Take a copy of our photo.

170
00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.700
At least take a look at it.

171
00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.500
It's not that embarrassing.

172
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.100
You still look handsome.

173
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.280
Zhao Fanzhou.

174
00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.460
Do you know what you must have

175
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.100
in an amusement park

176
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.220
except a roller coaster ride?

177
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.210
What?

178
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.380
The right manner.

179
00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.180
Come on.

180
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.180
Do I have to wear it?

181
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.460
You absolutely have to wear it.

182
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.740
When you are in an amusement park,

183
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:19.340
you can't have the right manner

184
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.300
without a hair band.

185
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.500
Put it on.

186
00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.290
Look. Look.

187
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.100
We look so cute.

188
00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:30.900
Should we take another roller coaster ride

189
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.300
with these hair bands on?

190
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:33.580
The roller coaster.

191
00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.140
The roller coaster.
The roller coaster. The roller coaster.

192
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.500
Someone is scared.

193
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.420
Someone has lost his nerve.

194
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:43.100
Are you afraid of losing your hair band

195
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.340
on the roller coaster?

196
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.220
Don't worry. It won't fall off.

197
00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.940
It definitely will not fall off.

198
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.900
I can't hear you. Stop talking.

199
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.940
You really can't hear me?

200
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.700
You really can't hear me?

201
00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.500
Coward.

202
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:55.140
Zhao Fanzhou is a coward.

203
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.300
Coward.

204
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.900
Zhao Fanzhou is a coward.

205
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.940
If you say it again,

206
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:26.780
I will kiss you.

207
00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.300
I'm going to buy drinks.

208
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.500
Let me buy drinks.

209
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.860
You've bought the tickets.

210
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.700
I should pay for drinks.

211
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.620
I'm not the type of man

212
00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:39.380
who lets a girl buy drinks.

213
00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:39.980
I'm leaving.

214
00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.060
I'll wait here for you.

215
00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.620
You scared me.

216
00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:22.380
What are you doing?

217
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.420
I am worrying

218
00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.820
that lovey-dovey couple

219
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.580
will upset you.

220
00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.900
You didn't

221
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.020
carry my bag steadily

222
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.260
or hit the marks.

223
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.060
I said

224
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:50.740
I missed the marks by accident.

225
00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:56.380
Xie Yixing.

226
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.380
Huh.

227
00:13:59.340 --> 00:13:59.780
Thank you.

228
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.340
No problem.

229
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.460
Yeah.

230
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.460
If you ever want a boyfriend,

231
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500
let me be your first choice.

232
00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.340
Don't flatter yourself.

233
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.060
Don't you know shame?

234
00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:13.900
I'm shameless in front of you.

235
00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:17.740
Alright.

236
00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.100
Let's have more fun.

237
00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:21.540
Come on.

238
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.740
You want to play more?

239
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.260
Of course.

240
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.220
Why shouldn't we have more fun?

241
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.100
Come on.

242
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:26.540
Let's go.

243
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:30.980
Which way?

244
00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.220
This way.

245
00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.820
Okay. Come on.

246
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.620
Go.

Dear visitors,

272
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:43.770
we are sorry to inform you

273
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.500
that tonight's firework performance

274
00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.540
will not take place as scheduled

275
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:49.300
due to a malfunction.

276
00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.220
Sorry for the inconvenience.

277
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.900
What a shame.

278
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.740
Please forgive us.

279
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.020
I need to answer the phone.

280
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:01.780
Okay.

281
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.900
Hello, mom.

282
00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.060
Son.

283
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.420
Are you busy?

284
00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:09.980
No.

285
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:10.740
Go on.

286
00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020
I plan

287
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.580
to go on a trip

288
00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:15.300
with my friends.

289
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.860
I'm going to book
a high-speed rail ticket now.

290
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.300
And I wanted to call you first.

291
00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.020
Okay.

292
00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.060
Understood.

293
00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.700
Take care of yourself

294
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.020
at the university.

295
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.130
Yeah.

296
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:28.220
You should take care too.

297
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.780
What should we do later?

298
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.740
Maybe have dinner?

299
00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.540
Oh yeah.

300
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:32.140
What will we eat?

301
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.140
Western food.

302
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.140
Western food?

303
00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.060
Barbecue.

304
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.540
What about Sichuan food?

305
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.060
Sichuan food is good.

306
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:40.780
Lu.

307
00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.300
Do you want it?

308
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.740
Since we won't be watching
the fireworks, just forget it.

309
00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.900
We have basically played everything we can.

310
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.620
If we don't leave until closing time,

311
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.660
it will be difficult to hail a taxi.

312
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.340
Maybe you should leave first.

313
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.740
We want to stay and play a little longer.

314
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.460
But...

315
00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.020
No but.

316
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.380
Don't you understand?

317
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.900
Their date goes on.

318
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.300
Let's go.

319
00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:02.820
Come on.

320
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.860
-I... -Get going.

321
00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.260
I'm leaving.

322
00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:05.620
Bye.

323
00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:06.060
Bye.

324
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.100
Bye.

325
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.020
Bye.

326
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:14.540
What misdeed have you done this time?

327
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.140
I've been doing good, okay?

328
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.540
Unfortunately, I won't be rewarded
for my good deeds.

329
00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:22.220
I won't even be able to watch the fireworks.

330
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.500
Why does it always reverse?

331
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.180
It looks good, right?

332
00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.100
Yeah.

333
00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:35.660
Let me pin it on you.

334
00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.740
Okay.

335
00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.420
Look, it's perfect.

336
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:05.660
You...

337
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.700
This...

338
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.500
How did you get it?

339
00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.020
Can you hurry up?

340
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:13.300
Look at the time.

341
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:15.180
Don't you want to have supper?

342
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:24.940
Shen Mengjun.

343
00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:26.100
What's wrong with you?

344
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.680
Why did you go to my workplace again?

345
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:29.700
I said I would call you back
after I finished working.

346
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.180
You said you would.
But did you really call me back?

347
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:31.900
Did you?

348
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.980
I was busy.

349
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.380
You often went to my workplace.

350
00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.860
You made me lose face.

351
00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.820
Which is more important,
your face or your family?

352
00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:40.500
Ask your son. Does he know who you are?

353
00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.780
Your bad temper

354
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.540
makes it impossible for our marriage to work!

355
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.660
I want a divorce!

356
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:48.620
Divorce?

357
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.300
You have become rich, right?

358
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.340
So you don't want me anymore, right?

359
00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.300
What will we do about our child
after divorcing? I'm asking you.

360
00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.300
I'll bring up the child.

361
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:58.740
Even if I lose everything,

362
00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.860
I will divorce you.

363
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.620
Every minute I spend with you

364
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.060
is torture to me.

365
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:05.220
Come here.

366
00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:05.940
Come here.

367
00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:06.780
I can't bear living with you.

368
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.460
What?

369
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:08.900
Let me go.

370
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.540
Unhand me...

371
00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:12.740
Son.

372
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.420
Son.

373
00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:15.660
Son.

374
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:16.740
What happened?

375
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.340
Son.

376
00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.380
Son.

377
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.300
What made you bleed?

378
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.060
What happened?

379
00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.500
Go away.

380
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.380
You go away.

381
00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.220
He needs to go to the hospital.

382
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.820
Come on, son.

383
00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:28.980
Don't be afraid.

384
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.580
Don't be afraid.

385
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.340
Did the story scare you?

386
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.540
I actually didn't want you

387
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.420
to know about it.

388
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.340
I got excited for nothing.

389
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:49.980
Huh?

390
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.500
I thought you were a hooligan

391
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.260
and you got that scar

392
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.340
from a duel.

393
00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.620
The heroes in fiction

394
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.540
always have this kind of backstory.

395
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.220
Sorry.

396
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.620
I have disappointed you.

397
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.280
It's okay.

398
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.020
Wearing my medal,

399
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.140
you are my hero.

400
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:15.980
Thank you.

401
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.260
Let's go.

402
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.460
Go where?

403
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:35.260
(Busy)

404
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.780
Turn right.

405
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:50.980
Turn right. Turn right.

406
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:44.620
(Busy)

407
00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.620
Where are we?

408
00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.180
Wait here for me.

409
00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:12.460
Where are you going?

410
00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:14.420
I will be back soon.

411
00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:17.660
Where exactly are you going?

412
00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.860
Weird.

413
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.860
I'm left here alone.

414
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.260
Did Zhao Fanzhou leave
to contact a human trafficker?

415
00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.420
Am I worth much money?

416
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:55.340
I should be worth much money.

417
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.260
Fireworks.

418
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:39.460
♪It's a promise made
by warm spring to winter.♪

419
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:45.860
Where did you get the fireworks?

420
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:46.780
I've bought them.

421
00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.700
Zhao Fanzhou.

422
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.820
I hereby declare

423
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.060
that I worship you.

424

although I talk foolishly sometimes.♪

426
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.380
Who set off the fireworks?

427
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:24.940
Run.

428
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.220
I've seen you.

429
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.020
There is nowhere to run.

430
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.380
I'm telling you,

431
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.180
if I catch you,

432
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.340
I will fine you.

433
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.900
Stop running.

434
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.820
Is he gone?

435
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.580
I think so.

436
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:54.620
Then let's get out.

437
00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.580
Come on.

438
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.060
Go.

439
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:57.660
Come on.

440
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:02.580
Are you alright?

441
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:02.900
I'm fine.

442
00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:03.740
I'm fine.

443
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.420
Is he gone?

444
00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:08.980
I think he is gone.

445
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.100
How did you find this place?

446
00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.740
This place is so quiet.

447
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.300
I used to do

448
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.500
my homework here.

449
00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.460
Do your homework?

450
00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.180
Here?

451
00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:18.860
So

452
00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.580
this is your secret base.

453
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:28.700
Yeah.

454
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.100
Thank you.

455
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:34.940
Why do you thank me?

456
00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.540
Thank you

457
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.900
for sharing your secret base with me.

458
00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:42.180
Don't come here and do homework alone.

459
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.820
You have got me now.

460
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.180
I'll do homework with you.

461
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.060
Courtesy demands reciprocity.

462
00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.060
I'm showing you some fireworks too.

463
00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.300
Look.

464
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:11.740
Bubble fireworks.

465
00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:13.540
Are you touched?

466
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:14.940
Yeah.

467
00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:17.060
Hold the light.

468
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.180
It starts now.

469
00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:25.740
Does it look like fireworks?

470
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.460
Look at the glorious fireworks
I set off for you.

471
00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:58.420
Zhao Fanzhou.

472
00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:03.780
Are you here to pick me up?

473
00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:04.620
Yes.

474
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:06.340
Let's go.

475
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:07.020
Yeah.

476
00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.100
Hold on.

477
00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:11.260
What's the matter?

478
00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:14.460
What is that?

479
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.180
Toothpaste foam.

480
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:18.620
Alright.

481
00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:19.740
Hold it.

482
00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.500
Sit tight.

483
00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.580
Mr. Zhao.

484
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.460
Can you please hurry up?

485
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.940
I'll be late if you keep riding slowly.

486
00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:38.340
Look at that youngster.

487
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:39.620
Are you getting old?

488
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.980
You are old.

489
00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.260
Ride it yourself.

490
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:47.740
I can ride it.

491
00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.540
You think I lack the nerve?

492
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.140
Hold it.

493
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.140
Hold it.

494
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:57.900
I'll show you

495
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.780
a youngster's speed and passion.

496
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:01.820
Let's go.

497
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.060
You are so heavy.

498
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.820
Help. Help. Help.

499
00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:11.780
Help.

500
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:12.940
Help.

501
00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:13.980
Your phone.

502
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.340
My phone dropped.

503
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.780
Hurry. Put me down.

504
00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.500
I'd rather have a broken screen.

505
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.980
I'll take it for repair.

506
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:26.700
It's okay.

507
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.460
It's still usable.

508
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.220
The phone is lucky enough

509
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.260
to escape death.

510
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.180
Come on.

511
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:33.780
You still want to ride it?

512
00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:36.820
Yeah.

513
00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.100
I didn't do my best just now.

514
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:45.300
Slow down.

515
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.820
Don't worry.

516
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:47.820
Let's go.

517
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:53.500
Is this alright?

518
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.100
Move it right a little.

519
00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:55.780
Okay.

520
00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.420
I'm regretting.

521
00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:58.580
I don't want to carry you anymore.

522
00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.580
Too late.

523
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.260
No.

524
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.340
Your legs are too long.

525
00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.900
They are rubbing against the ground.
I can't carry you.

526
00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:03.860
My legs are in the air.

527
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.420
Then you are too heavy.

528
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:08.660
You are too heavy.

529
00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:09.460
You are not that light.

530
00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.100
I'm telling you,

531
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.380
you are losing your girlfriend.

532
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.340
Help.

533
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.540
I'll pick you up at lunchtime.

534
00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:44.940
Aren't you going to work today?

535
00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:46.700
I have a lecture to attend today.

536
00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.220
I need to decorate the lecture hall later.

537
00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.620
Whose lecture?

538
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:51.740
Medical Examiner Qin Meng.

539
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:53.860
Qin Meng?

540
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.340
Qin Meng, the medical examiner
who writes detective fiction?

541
00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.420
I love her so much.

542
00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:01.980
When will it be held?

543
00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:02.340
Where can I sign up for it?

544
00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:02.820
I want to attend the lecture.

545
00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:04.420
This lecture is only open

546
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.420
to the Department of Forensic Medicine.

547
00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:09.420
What a bummer.

548
00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:10.980
Then

549
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.380
where is the lecture hall?

550
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.220
Can I peep from the door?

551
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.180
Or you can transfer to my department.

552
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.140
Speaking of which,

553
00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.340
I recall a saying,

554
00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.860
"If you marry a chicken,
you follow the chicken.

555
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.220
If you marry a dog, you follow the dog."

556
00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:24.460
Are you a chicken or a dog?

557
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.060
I think the emphasis

558
00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:29.500
should be placed

559
00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:30.380
on the word

560
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:31.820
"marry".

561
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:35.900
I'll get to work.

562
00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.180
Stretch your wrists and ankles.

563
00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:58.500
Stretch your shoulders later.

564
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.260
Stretch for a while.

565
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.860
You are treating me like a novice.

566
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.980
You haven't trained for a month.

567
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:06.580
Warm up a little.

568
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:07.940
Soon,

569
00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.020
you will bask in my glamour

570
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.140
and fall head over heels for me.

571
00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:14.540
Come off it.

572
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.780
Are you ready for my charm?

573
00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.060
I'm going to break your charm with my racket.

574
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:23.300
Lu.

575
00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.900
You are getting above yourself.

576
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:25.860
Come on.

577
00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:35.420
Hello, President.

578
00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.860
Hello, President.

579
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.380
-President. -Hello, President.

580
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:50.100
Shall we continue to practice?

581
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:53.780
Yes.

582
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:55.580
Come on.

583
00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.060
President,

584
00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.620
should we get some new shuttlecocks?

585
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.090
Yes.

586
00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.460
I will apply for funding.

587
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.500
If you need funding in the future,

588
00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.700
go talk to Xie Yixing.

589
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.460
Okay.

590
00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:08.660
Continue the training.

591
00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:09.060
Yes.

592
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.220
Xie Yixing, uh...

593
00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:27.340
Sorry.

594
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.700
I didn't do it on purpose.

595
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:31.980
Xie Yixing.

596
00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.380
I need to talk to you about the handover
of the Badminton Club.

597
00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.180
Even King Shu of Overtime is here.

598
00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.340
Why is Zhou Xiao not here?

599
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.340
She probably is working
part-time at the library.

600
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.260
Today...

601
00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.620
I haven't called the roll yet, have I?

602
00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.540
Now,

603
00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:58.660
I will call the roll.

604
00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.740
Call Zhou Xiao right now.

605
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.100
Luo Wei.

606
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:03.580
Here.

607
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.580
Sorry, Mr. Shu.

608
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.260
I'm late.

609
00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:08.780
Take your seat.

610
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.460
Thank you, Mr. Shu.

611
00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:14.940
Where were you?

612
00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.260
Working at the library.

613
00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.100
It's lucky to arrive in time. Gosh.

614
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:22.460
Wei.

615
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.140
Wei.

616
00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.020
Do you know Qin Meng

617
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:27.660
will hold a lecture at our university?

618
00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.700
I know.

619
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.220
I saw it when I was browsing
the university forum.

620
00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.500
It's a pity that she will only give a lecture
to the Department of Forensic Medicine.

621
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.820
I want to attend the lecture.

622
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.700
Yeah. I want to attend it too.

623
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.740
You too?

624
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:39.300
Yeah.

625
00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.540
Actually,

626
00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:41.940
I'm a fan of her books.

627
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.100
All of us must read

628
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.020
her "24-Hour Detective" series

629
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.820
under our quilts when we were younger.

630
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.020
Zhou Xiao.

631
00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.020
Here.

632
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:57.140
You not only arrived late,

633
00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:58.660
but also chatted

634
00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:00.780
with them non-stop

635
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.540
in the classroom.

636
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.660
Have you gained an insight
into the writing class' future

637
00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.700
that is more unique and profound than mine?

638
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.580
No, Mr. Shu. Here is the thing.

639
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:12.020
The famous alumna Qin Meng

640
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.420
will hold a lecture in our
Department of Forensic Medicine.

641
00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.020
But she is both

642
00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:18.140
a medical examiner and a writer.

643
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:21.220
So we hope Qin Meng

644
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.220
will hold a lecture

645
00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.340
for all the writing enthusiasts
in our university.

646
00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.060
What do you guys think?

647
00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:27.540
Why should the Department of Forensic Medicine
be her only audience?

648
00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.660
Yeah. We want to attend her lecture as well.

649
00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.020
I read every one of

650
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.460
her detective novels.

651
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:33.820
They are so good.

652
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.020
Very good.

653
00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:35.980
Alright. Enough.

654
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.380
Quiet down.

655
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.660
Your ideas are always alternative.

656
00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.540
But that's a nice suggestion you have made.

657
00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.540
Since you are

658
00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:46.260
so enthusiastic

659
00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:47.580
about Qin Meng,

660
00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.020
we will talk about detective fiction today.

661
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.300
Suspense

662
00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.820
means life to detective fiction.

663
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:58.220
They

664
00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.700
hide information

665
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.820
from an omniscient perspective

666
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:05.900
and use asymmetric writing techniques

667
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.060
to create suspense.

668
00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:14.380
Mister,

669
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.460
my phone is broken.

670
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.500
Take a look at it.

671
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.420
Your screen is broken.
You need to get a new motherboard.

672
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:23.660
But it was usable just then.

673
00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:25.980
Nothing.

674
00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.540
How much does a new motherboard cost?

675
00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.620
I'll give you a low price.

676
00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:30.460
One thousand and five hundred.

677
00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:33.020
You call 1,500 a low price?

678
00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:34.140
Of course.

679
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.340
I charge other people 1,600.

680
00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.420
The motherboard costs 1,200.

681
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.100
The repair fee is 400.

682
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.100
I have saved you 100.

683
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.740
If only Cai Yasi were here.

684
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.540
I feel his value

685
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.060
at times like this.

686
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.180
Do you want it repaired or not?

687
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.300
I will consider your offer.

688
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:48.860
Thank you.

689
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.780
Have you repaired your phone?

690
00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:00.540
If you have repaired your phone,
come to the lab for me.

691
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:01.780
The person you want to see is here.

692
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.180
Mister.

693
00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:05.340
It just lit up.

694
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:05.940
I saw it.

695
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.060
That was just a flash before its demise.

696
00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.020
Repair it.

697
00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:14.740
It'll take a few days.

698
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:15.340
How about this?

699
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.980
I'll give you a spare phone.

700
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.140
My shop is small,

701
00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.540
but the service is thoughtful.

702
00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:21.260
Here.

703
00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:24.100
Mister.

704
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:27.180
Is this an antique you dug up
from under the ground?

705
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:28.820
It's free. Take it or not?

706
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:29.140
I'll take it.

707
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.740
That shot was absolutely amazing.

708
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:34.300
You did it like a player
in the national team.

709
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.780
I suggest that you try out
for the Municipal Badminton Team.

710
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.580
Enough is enough.

711
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.260
I said I didn't do it on purpose.

712
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.060
Got it.

713
00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:42.780
Got it.

714
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:44.580
We'll claim

715
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.540
it was an unintentional act in public.

716
00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:46.980
I really didn't do it on purpose.

717
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.380
Okay.

718
00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:47.980
Okay.

719
00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.620
I believe you.

720
00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:50.420
I believe you.

721
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.060
Just then, Chen Yu was so scared

722
00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.620
that his face turned green.

723
00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:56.780
Great revenge.

724
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:01.380
Can you quiet down and eat?

725
00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.020
Chen Yu's exchange program

726
00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.540
is coming to an end.

727
00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:13.740
He is going back, you know?

728
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.500
Yes, I know.

729
00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.300
He just talked to me

730
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.500
about the handover.

731
00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.300
He wanted me to tell you that he was sorry.

732
00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:30.660
But

733
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.220
I said on behalf of you

734
00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:33.460
that you wouldn't forgive him.

735
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:36.300
Thanks.

736
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.100
Guess what I told him.

737
00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.300
What did you tell him?

738
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.220
I told him,

739
00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.660
"You only said kind things

740
00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:45.660
because you are leaving.

741
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.100
You just want to leave

742
00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.860
without burdens.

743
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:48.780
Besides,

744
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.140
you don't have to apologize.

745
00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.620
My Lu

746
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.620
has already forgotten who you are."

747
00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:00.020
I'm not yours.

748
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:00.700
Huh?

749
00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:02.780
What did you say?

750
00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:07.140
I said food.

751
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.700
Have more food and shut your mouth.

752
00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:12.340
I don't eat fat.

753
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.420
Check out my body.

754
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:16.220
It's perfectly proportioned.

755
00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.220
I never eat fat.

756
00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.420
Whatever.

757
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.260
Is he

758
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.660
going to say

759
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.060
something cringeworthy

760
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.500
like "I will eat

761
00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:33.980
anything you give me"?

762
00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.660
You should eat less fat.

763
00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:38.940
Pay attention to your body fat percentage.

764
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:40.900
You look thin,

765
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.740
but you also look unhealthy.

766
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.140
No kidding.

767
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.540
I'm an expert in this field.

768
00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:47.980
Get it?

769
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.900
Eat more vegetables.

770
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.540
My current body fat percentage

771
00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:52.540
is 11%.

772
00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.100
Here.

773
00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:53.860
Have more vegetables.

774
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.220
Here.

775
00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.940
No.

776
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:56.780
Eat.

777
00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:58.540
No.

778
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.220
Whatever.

779
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:04.380
Eat less fat.

780
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:05.380
Get it?

781
00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:15.540
(Next Episode)
Since when has Zhao Fanzhou

782
00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:18.340
been interested in love psychology.

783
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.820
You've got to be careful.

784
00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.220
Do you know where Zhao Fanzhou is?

785
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:22.580
If you don't know, why would I know?

786
00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:23.820
Fanzhou asked me not to tell.

787
00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.100
Zhao Fanzhou is obviously hiding from me.

788
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.740
We broke up.

789
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:28.660
Did he hurt you?

790
00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.700
