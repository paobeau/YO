00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.930
<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.320
<i>Is it loyalty to your colleagues?</i>

4
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.070
<i>Or what? Is it your sense of justice?</i>

5
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.170
<i>Why on earth?</i>

6
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.350
<i>Because I learned from you.</i>

7
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.990
<i>That the losing side, is our side.</i>

8
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.560
<i>May, 1994</i>

9
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.050
Good riddance.

10
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.880
<i>Police</i>

11
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.060
So is the show over?
 <i>Episode 4</i>

12
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.870
I heard that you gave the direct orders for this forced dispersal.

13
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.340
That's why I told you to get rid of them earlier.

14
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.250
I was planning to have a formal negotiation today

15
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.250
to create a history that we've followed procedure.

16
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.070
For formality or whatever, why would you have a conversation with them?

17
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.420
Why are you doing things you normally don't do? Do they have something on you?

18
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.570
It was a decision made while thinking of public opinion.

19
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.750
So you're afraid of malicious comments. Are you a celebrity?

20
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.160
Thanks to you, I became more famous than any average celebrity.

21
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.320
Economic crimes, corruption, tax evasion.

22
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.050
An unrivaled son of a bitch who does all the dirty things.

23
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.900
So now, you don't want to be called a son of a bitch?

24
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.220
What, you want to become a refined hunter?

25
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.230
If I was a hunter, I wouldn't have cornered the rabbit in this manner.

26
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.220
Most of the people are housewives in their 40s and 50s.

27
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.850
If you push them too harshly, there will certainly be a backlash.

28
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.880
That could happen.

29
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.270
Come back here tomorrow morning.

30
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.370
I think you came to ask me to save your face, in your own way.

31
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.590
There's something I have to think about too.

32
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.740
Do you not have a husband?

33
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.250
I do not.

34
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.990
What about your parents?

35
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.970
They're not around.

36
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.640
Do you not have a guardian?

37
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.970
I am my own guardian.

38
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.080
That's your opinion.

39
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.390
So you don't have anyone to guarantee your identity, is that it?

40
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.560
You won't be able to leave today.

41
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.710
Even if you had a guarantor, you wouldn't be able to leave today anyway (due to a criminal record).

42
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.300
Investigate the truth on Gwangju's massacre!

43
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.940
<i>May 1994</i>

44
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.990
- Oh, scary. 
 - Investigate the truth

45
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.300
on Gwangu's massacre!

46
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.370
Let's hurry and go, we're about to get covered in tear gas again.

47
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.870
Let me go see Sunbae.

48
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.300
How can you? It looks like they're going to throw tear gas soon.

49
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.640
Today is 5.18, it's a big event, so it should be alright.
 <i>(5.18 = May 18 Gwangju Democratization Movement)</i>

50
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.760
You must be crazy.

51
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.790
Head back first.

52
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.120
Yoon Ji Soo!

53
00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.530
Investigate the truth on Gwangju's massacre!

54
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.230
- Bow your head! 
 - Look down!

55
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.550
Lower your eyes!

56
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.030
- Hey. 
 - Bow your head!

57
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.220
- Don't look around! 
 - What do you want to do, rascal! Hey!

58
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.200
Do you have a lighter?

59
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.830
What?

60
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.700
If you have one, hide it.

61
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.520
If they find a Molotov cocktail on you, then you'll be imprisoned immediately.

62
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.550
Lower your head.

63
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.030
- Hey. 
 - Lower it!

64
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.850
Lower your head!

65
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.240
What's your father's name?

66
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.710
Your father's name!

67
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.140
Yoon Hyeong Goo.

68
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.660
Geez, this is stuck.

69
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.580
Where does he work?

70
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.580
Where does he work!?!

71
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.870
Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

72
00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.660
You lie so meticulously.

73
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.420
Why not just say he works in the Blue House (presidential residence)?

74
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.570
He does work there.

75
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:11.430
What's his job there? Head clerk?

76
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.070
Director of the prosecutor's office.

77
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.140
You're a complete wacko.

78
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.580
I was going to bring your daughter to you...

79
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.180
Forget it.

80
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.100
Not now.

81
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.600
Later.

82
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:41.620
Illegal protesting, obstruction of business, obstruction of justice.

83
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.930
Wow, your track record is quite colorful.

84
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.850
Is your job to be a professional demonstrator?

85
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:54.780
What does being unfairly dismissed and charged in the past have to do with today's protest?

86
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.930
If I've been dismissed before, do I need to stay silent when being dismissed again today?

87
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.450
The employer who did the unfair dismissals is the one at fault.

88
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.410
How is it the fault of the laborer who was unfairly dismissed?

89
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.740
Why are you being like this, between us pro players?

90
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.670
I've seen enough slippery eels who get fake jobs for the purpose of fomenting these uprisings.

91
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.800
Anyway, just stay here quietly, Ms. Choi Seon Hui. It looks like this will take a while.

92
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.990
Yoon Ji Soo is still inside.

93
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.730
There are people who left because their guardians came.

94
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:36.180
But those who have a previous record or other problems with their personal information are in the detention cell.

95
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.090
You don't know what the problem is with Yoon Ji Soo?

96
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:40.860
No, I don't really know about these details.

97
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.630
<i> I realized I didn't know anything about Ji Soo.</i>

98
00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:55.100
What classes she's taking, who her friends are, nothing.

99
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.370
That's right, you punk. There really is a problem with you.

100
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.740
Is demonstrating some sort of high-ranking job? Why must you sacrifice everything around you?

101
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.660
Yes, this is Today's Books.

102
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.610
Yes, President Kim.

103
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.780
Ah, we haven't confirmed whether the book you have ordered is in stock yet.

104
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.290
Yes, I will call you as soon as that book comes in.

105
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.570
Yes, goodbye.

106
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.170
Hey, go and call my beeper. Something's got to be wrong with it.

107
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.010
Your beeper has done nothing wrong.

108
00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.630
You're the one that's wrong.

109
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.250
Just give up, graciously.

110
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:34.710
Didn't you hear? Her father is the director of the prosecutor's office.

111
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.400
What if he hands you a 10-year sentence?

112
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.860
And you saw it, didn't you? That snap, speed, and grip.

113
00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.250
That flawless full-swing slap?

114
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:46.700
Pshh... whack, whack, whack.

115
00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.890
So he finally goes.

116
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.350
What a relief.

117
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.970
Sleep well, Ji Soo.

118
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.830
Sunbae!

119
00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.900
How can you just leave?

120
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.360
Give me your shoes too.

121
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.450
But you have really big feet.

122
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.230
How do you know?

123
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:22.970
Your footprints in the snow.

124
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.370
You're so high maintenance.

125
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.830
And you're so affectionate.

126
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:27.310
Your feet hurt don't they? Let's switch shoes.

127
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:33.430
Ji Soo.

128
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:40.040
I don't like war films.

129
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.580
Well, of course, I hate wars more.

130
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.390
Why are you bringing up war films all of a sudden?

131
00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:51.800
Whether's it's the general or an officer,

132
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.030
the main protagonist always relays commands while standing in the middle.

133
00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:01.330
On the frontline, the nameless infantry take the bullets,

134
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.470
and even if they are lucky enough to survive,

135
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.310
the enemy general falls without a sound, from a sword or a bullet.

136
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:13.520
But no one in there deserves to just be taken down by a gun or sword.

137
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.110
Before they fell, they were all the main protagonist in their own lives.

138
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.260
Even though it's just a film,

139
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:26.990
the idea of humans being used as tools or regarded as trivial

140
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.120
is something I really don't like.

141
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:37.990
Humans should never trample on another human for any reason.

142
00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.400
That is another reason why I am doing demonstrations.

143
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.640
And although I am not religious, I do believe there is a God.

144
00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:52.980
And that is why I believe that humans are all God's children.

145
00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.650
Ji Soo,

146
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:14.880
to God, every human is a finger that hurts when it is bitten (every human is precious).

147
00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.770
Don't let anyone treat you poorly.

148
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.620
Even if it's your family.

149
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:35.150
Because you are a very precious

150
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.480
child of God.

151
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.500
You really have big feet, Sunbae.

152
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.050
Is that why you have such a big heart?

153
00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.420
Shall I go take a look one more time?

154
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.860
Let's just go.

155
00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.370
Yes.

156
00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:59.160
<i>You're doing things that are out of the ordinary because of that woman, right?</i>

157
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.570
Whenever you do something strange, that woman is always there.

158
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.400
She could be the reason since it does bring back memories from the past.

159
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:15.770
About what I used to believe was right, in the past.

160
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.020
It's not as if they're an organized labor movement.

161
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.800
It's not as if they're using strikes as a weapon to threaten the company.

162
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.300
Most of them are someone's mother or someone's grandmother.

163
00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.690
They are just like you, or just like our mothers.

164
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.710
To just forcefully sweep them aside is not the answer.

165
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:37.670
So what I wonder is, why did you become so soft?

166
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.240
Why did you change so suddenly? You're scaring me.

167
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.630
I may change even more, you never know.

168
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.340
What does that mean?

169
00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.560
Because I will be making choices that are different from the ones I made before.

170
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:51.520
But why are you doing that?

171
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.470
To become happy.

172
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.800
So what does that mean?

173
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.390
So you were not happy until now?

174
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:09.560
I'm just talking about my beliefs.

175
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.120
But isn't it the same thing?

176
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:14.030
Why are you confusing me by using complicated words?

177
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:22.470
Never mind anything else, but that woman,

178
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:25.310
I've got my eyes on her, so just know that.

179
00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.930
<i>Family Member of Chairman Jang of Hyeong Seong Group Discovered to Have Many Bank Accounts Under False Names</i>

180
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.540
I will release those,

181
00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.070
so you will have to take responsibility for this and take care of it.

182
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.470
Can you do it?

183
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.570
What kind of responsibility do you mean?

184
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.280
Since the statute of limitations is over,

185
00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.350
usually, taking some curses, and paying some taxes would be enough.

186
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.920
But on things like tax violations and stock trading violations, and whatever,

187
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.890
some cases of criminal affairs still remain.

188
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.400
Why? Scared that you will be bitten severely?

189
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.790
No, I've come to develop quite a tolerance for these things.

190
00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:19.380
I'm sure you would not like to see me or Seo Kyeong go to prison.

191
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.920
No, I wouldn't.

192
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:25.030
These borrowed-name accounts, they are all mine anyway.

193
00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.590
Briefly transfer them to your name,

194
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:32.520
and once things quiet down, I will transfer them to Seo Kyeong's name.

195
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.560
Don't worry about the taxes that come with the nominal transfer, or anything financial of the sort.

196
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.410
Yes, I understand.

197
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:45.510
But who do you think leaked this to the media?

198
00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.660
I believe that Director Hwang Hak Soo manages the borrowed-name accounts?

199
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.490
Yes, he's done that for a long time.

200
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.650
But it's not Hak Soo.

201
00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.770
I think it'll be important to look into who has access to it, apart from Director Hwang.

202
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:03.290
I'm going to summon Hak Soo to investigate this matter.

203
00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:07.120
You look into the movements of the executives and the shareholders.

204
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.440
Yes, I understand.

205
00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:14.370
Oh, and Seo Kyeong said she is concerned about something.

206
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.090
I told you to play around a bit, but you actually played around?

207
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.710
This silly girl,

208
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.940
she may seem like her eyes are wandering, but you are the only one for her.

209
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.100
So wrap it up, and comfort your wife.

210
00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.550
I cannot stand to see my child cry.

211
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.200
Aigoo.

212
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.250
- Let's go. 
 - What do we do?

213
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.570
Let's go.

214
00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.690
- Let's go, let's go. 
 - Let's go eat soft tofu.

215
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.440
The detention cell is the same as prison.

216
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.290
Eating tofu doesn't work, anyway. 
<i>(T/N: superstition - eating tofu will keep you from returning to prison)</i>

217
00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:04.970
You, really. It's not like having "earned stripes" (criminal convictions) is an honor.

218
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.800
It is an honor. At least no one takes me lightly.

219
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.080
How did you get out?

220
00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.770
You even have a "medal" (criminal record), so it must not have been easy.

221
00:21:16.770 --> 00:21:20.930
The company said to release everyone with a warning, so they can begin negotiations again.

222
00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:25.030
Then why did they arrest everyone if it's not to scare them?

223
00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.530
<i>Yes, I am a completely different person.</i>

224
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.080
<i>I am unspeakably selfish and materialistic.</i>

225
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.780
<i>And those temporary employees protesting right now, I will mow them all down.</i>

226
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.980
It's weird.

227
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.690
What is?

228
00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.490
Sunbae Jae Hyeon.

229
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:51.660
He said he would mow them all down, then he said he would negotiate.

230
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:55.070
Even yesterday, he seemed flustered during the forced dispersal.

231
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.880
Then today, he let everyone go.

232
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.480
I don't know if you know,

233
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:03.020
but Hyung Jae Hyeon doesn't have a good reputation.

234
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.370
They can't believe that he used to demonstrate. Whenever the alumni meet up,

235
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.050
they are always talking about Hyung Jae Hyeon.

236
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.020
Eighty percent of it is cursing him.

237
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.020
Of course, they could be jealous of him being the son-in-law of a conglomerate,

238
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.860
but the old Jae Hyeon never would have thought of becoming the son-in-law of a conglomerate.

239
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.590
It seemed like his father's death had some influence on him back then,

240
00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:27.080
but I don't know the details of what happened.

241
00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.740
For a person, to change is the same as what the big bang was for the universe.

242
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:37.030
Even so, you didn't change.

243
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.550
Even when, like you said, your world fell apart like the big bang.

244
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.360
Sorry, I didn't say that to hurt you.

245
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.050
But talking about Hyung Jae Hyeon did make me flare up a little, that's all.

246
00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:02.000
Yoon Ji Soo came out. The others have also been released with a warning.

<i>May, 1994</i>

What are you going to do about our Ji Soo?

249
00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.790
What do you want me to do about it?

250
00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:24.980
Are you asking because you don't know?

251
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:29.650
You know that she likes you, Hyung.

252
00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:34.650
Why won't you just tell her if you like her or not?

253
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.550
Yeong Woo,

254
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.020
actually, I'm dating Ji Soo—

255
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.350
She keeps following you around like a zombie.

256
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.220
Don't you even feel bad for her?

257
00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.810
Why are you being like this?

258
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.300
What did I do?

259
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:53.340
If I draw boundaries with Ji Soo, what are you going to do?

260
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.480
What do you mean, what will I do?

261
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.580
But she doesn't look at me.

262
00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:06.830
She doesn't look behind her or to her side but keeps looking only to the front.

263
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:12.780
That girl is as steadfast as Joan of Arc.

264
00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.980
What is this?

265
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.250
Is it something like Pandora's box?

266
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.100
I hope the negotiation goes well.

267

<i>What about you? Are you thinking of reinstatement?</i>

268
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:15.410
I found a job.

269
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.650
<i>Really? That's good.</i>

270
00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.670

You said you would come yesterday, how could you change the meeting on the same day?

273
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.940
I'm sorry. A situation came up for me yesterday.

274
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.820
We can't overlook things because of personal situations.

275
00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.740
This isn't a place where we deal with children, we deal with their mothers.

276
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.770
If you come even a minute late or teach them for a minute less, we get calls from the mothers immediately.

277
00:25:40.770 --> 00:25:42.690
And they request schedule changes all the time.

278
00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.390
Yes, I will be careful of that.

279
00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:49.500
Also, you can never tell the mothers that you dropped out of college.

280
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.010
Yes.

281
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:54.600
You said you would organize and clean the academy as well.

282
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.220
- Is that right?
 - Yes. I'll work hard.

No.

289
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:36.000
Is it because you're uncomfortable with me?

I found a different part-time job.

291
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.050
I think you need a stable job. Why did you make that decision?

292
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.750
A permanent position.

293
00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.800
Isn't that what you were protesting for?

294
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.890
It's the table that the unnis set.

295
00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.320
All I did was bring water. I don't have the right to lay my spoon on that table.

296
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:05.380
Those are spots that should go to people who staked their lives to protest from start to finish.

297
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.460
I had given up in the middle, using the excuse that I had to make a living.

298
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.230
Then other than those positions.

299
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.250
Do you have any thoughts of doing other work, such as a desk job?

300
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:20.560
Did you give this offer to the others as well?

No.

302
00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.260
Then isn't this a corrupt offer of employment?

303
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:26.260
It's not illegal for me to hire people I want to work in my company.

304
00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.540
Bringing in an incompetent person will be a problem.

What would someone who majored in piano do there?

I didn't even graduate from college, so in reality, I'm just a high school graduate.

307

Sunbae,

308
00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.600
I don't have anything, and I don't have much to show for my life.

309
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:53.240
But that was probably why my heart was lighter.

310
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:58.360
I was busy just thinking about the future,

311
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.010
so I didn't have the time nor the need to reminisce on memories.

312
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:08.990
But after meeting you, my heart has become heavy again.

313
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:16.660
I keep looking behind me, so my footsteps become slower.

314
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.960
I wanted to leave those times that were pretty like flowers, just as they were.

315
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.390
But it feels like the sunbae who has changed is trampling all over those flowers, so I'm angry.

316
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.250
Then you shouldn't have left.

317
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.920
How can separation be pretty?

318
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.780
I still

319
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.230
don't understand why you left like that.

320
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:07.160
When sharing my pain, for me, it doesn't get halved, but rather becomes twice as painful.

321
00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.730
Because I have to see the person I love being in pain.

322
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:18.930
Is there a bigger pain than separation from someone you love?

323
00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:26.300
Ji Soo, I also don't reminisce about memories

324
00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.050
because you were never just a memory to me.

325
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.700
You were like a heavy rock weighing down my heart,

326
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:40.770
a fishbone stuck in my throat. How can that become a memory?

327
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.290
Just leave it as a memory.

328
00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:56.630
Just remember the good memories, I will do the same.

<i>June, 1994</i> 
 ♫ silence ♫

♫ has dried out my lips ♫

♫ Goodbye, goodbye ♫

334
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.210
In the eyes of a music major, I'm pretty good, right?

335
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:13.810
I don't know much about guitars, but you seem like you can play quite well.

336
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:15.760
Then, should I play Revival for you?

337
00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.930
Where's Sunbae Jae Hyeon?

338
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:19.610
- Are you curious?
 - Yes.

339
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:21.200
Give me 500 won (≈ $0.50).

340
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.860
Okay.

341
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.890
Did he not tell you he's preparing for the elections these days?

342
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.450
Elections? Is he applying for student council president?

343
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.650
Not that, chief host of student council.

344
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.220
Chief Host?

345
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.270
I'm the one who's good at hosting events, though.

346
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:40.470
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Ji Soo Yoon.

347
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.020
Is it really about being master of ceremony?

348
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.950
That's right. You know how people grab the mike when demonstrating?

349
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:47.400
So the Chief Host is a demonstrating position, originally.

350
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:51.970
Someone who hosts the event, while caring about society, hence a chief host. 
 <i>(T/N: society and host are homonyms)</i>

351
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:55.390
And he also has to "struggle for supplies," as well.

352
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:57.930
"Struggle for supplies?"

353
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:04.920
Supply struggle.

354
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.880
In other words, a part-time job.

355
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.490
With this, he earns money to pay for his travel expenses, his food, and campaign funds as well.

356
00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.460
There wouldn't be much left.

357
00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.750
That's carrot. <i>(in English)</i>

358
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:15.890
A carol?

359
00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:18.490
No, carrot, "danggeun." 
 <i>(T/N: 'danggeun' means carrot, but also "that goes without saying.") </i>

360
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.590
The others all laugh so hard they fall to the ground.

361
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.280
But he would earn a lot more if he worked as a tutor.

362
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:32.120
The reason why he's doing that is so apparent.

363
00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.630
That sunbae...

364
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.290
The Invincible Hwa Jin.

365
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.580
When she takes those riot squad fuzz one-on-one, she wins 100% of the time.

366
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.460
Her hobby is to steal their helmets,

367
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.230
so if you go to her house,

368
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.720
she uses them as buckets, or to store rice in.

369
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.930
She is a legendary female warrior.

370
00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.930
So he's working there because of her?

371
00:32:54.930 --> 00:33:00.620
No, let's do some thinking. Think.

372
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:05.700
If he works there, he can have secret rendezvous with the others and save time going to and fro.

373
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.640
It's "one hit, double blow," isn't it? <i>(in English)</i>

374
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.690
What is that?

375
00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:12.490
One shot, two kills (kill two birds with one stone).

376
00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:18.250
And that purist says that tutoring rich kids is like collaborating with capitalism, so that's why he hates it.

377
00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:20.600
That tiresome punk.

378
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:24.460
He must be so tired.

Are you happy that you're the only one feeling refreshed?

381
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.820
What?

382
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:48.290
This was broken earlier.

383
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.320
I can guess who came by.

384
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.940
Who came by?

385
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.980
You, why are you sleeping here?

386
00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.890
Ah, because it's hot.

387
00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:03.940
Isn't it so hot? The weather prediction says this is the hottest.

388
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.310
Stop fanning me. It's not refreshing at all.

389
00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.980
Then don't do the part-time job at the front gate. It's so hot.

390
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.900
It's this hot,

391
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.550
but I'm not tired at all because of someone.

392
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.420
Today really is my birthday.

393
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:24.510
It's your birthday today?

394
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:28.120
It's not my birthday, but it feels as good as if it was my birthday.

395
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.360
When is your birthday?

396
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.160
On the 29th.

397
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.200
Of June.

398
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:36.660
There isn't much time left.

399
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.460

Get out right now!

403
00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.120
You devoured her.

If it wasn't for you.

405

Get out! Get out right now!

407

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.980
What did I do?

410
00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.320
What could I have done? What should I have done?!

411
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.320
I know you need someone to resent.

412
00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.110
I know you need someone to release your anger on, but please stop now!

413
00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.940
It's not like she'll come back from the dead if you do this.

414
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.830
I know too.

415
00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:41.320
I shouldn't have been born.

416
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.920
It really should have been that way.

417
00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.830
If it weren't for that, everything would be fine...

418
00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.590
Oh my, you're like this again.

419

Please don't cry, okay?

421
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:07.790
I bought the honey cookies that you like, so don't be mad anymore.

You are an embarrassment in front of our neighbors, so attend school quietly, as if you're dead.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:08.550
Yes.

473
00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:13.780
You're so curt. As if anyone would think you're not your father's son.

474
00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:17.090
Where's your dad?

475
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:19.560
- He's probably at school. 
 - Why?

476
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.440
That punk fainted.

477
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.840
That punk?

478
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.040
The one who threw the chair at me.

- Isn't it because you chose me? 
 - Seo Gyeong...

499
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.950
I always said this to my dad.

500
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:50.000
That you were the best decision of my life.

501
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.360
I'm thankful for that, so I'm doing my best.

502
00:46:55.670 --> 00:47:02.430
You were the best for me, but to you, I was the best you could do.

503
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.710
- Seo Gyeong.
 - Stop talking.

504
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:09.540
I understand everything, with the word "thankful."

<i>Hyeong Seong</i>

506
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.810
- She is working at the hotel. 
 - What work is she doing?

507
00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:24.220
She plays the piano in the lounge.

508
00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.900
- Jae Hyeon goes there often. 
 - Yes.

509
00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.270
By chance, could she have been a gold digger from the start?

510
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:36.120
She started working a year ago, which was when the vice president was incarcerated.

511
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.940
Who knows? Maybe she visited him in prison.

512
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:44.390
But something special that she does performs with a  mask on her face.

513
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:46.240
Really?

514
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.170
So she doesn't want her face to become known, huh?

515
00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:58.320
I need to put her in her place.

516
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.510
- Do you have time on Friday evening? 
 - Why?

517
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.160
There is going to be a private party in a suite room that day.

518
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:10.790
They asked for a piano performance, from you specifically.

519
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.480
- From me? 
 - Yes.

520
00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:18.130
They asked specifically for the person who plays with a mask on.

521
00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:22.430
- They said they like your performance the best. 
 - Who ist it?

522
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:25.360
A VVVIP client.

523
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.140
They said you'll find out who they are if you come that day.

524
00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:32.420
The pay is twice the usual amount.

525
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:46.210
Since it's a party for this brand, they asked you to wear this.

526
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.160
They said you can just return it when it ends.

527
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.870
Such an expensive item.

528
00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.560
What do I do if something bad happens to it.

529
00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:56.370
Oh, I'm sure nothing will happen.

530
00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.100
You're going to come, right?

531
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.900
No.

532
00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.380
It's a command from your boss (me).

533
00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:15.760
It's not just a party, but a showcase for our brand.

534
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.950
I know that I don't have to go.

535
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:20.150
Things such as having influencers taking pictures to upload it onto their SNS,

536
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:23.010
global top brands do all those things too.

537
00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:28.040
Does it make sense for the president to go to this event, but for the vice president not to?

538
00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.850
Seo Gyeong.

539
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:32.910
Can you not even do this much for me?

540
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:35.460
You can spend a whole day at the ER for someone else's son,

541
00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.580
but you can't spend just two hours for your wife.

542
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:42.650
Is that what you call doing your best?

543
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.970
Even if I'm not smart, my intuition is good.

544
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:53.670
I said that I love you, how can you reply that you're thankful?

545
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.370
And why didn't you say you're sorry?

546
00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:03.400
Live the rest of your life apologizing to me.

547
00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.480
- Oh my, it's been a long time. 
 - Hello.

548
00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:12.250
- It has been a long time, hasn't it? 
 - Thank you for coming.

549
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.880
Jae Hyeon, where are you?

550
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:20.970
Okay, come quickly.

551
00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.080
Drink this as you perform.

552
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.480
You can't put the drink here. Oh no!

553
00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:45.760
Oh no, are you okay? Oh no, what do we do?

554
00:52:04.300 --> 00:52:06.140
Are you okay?

555
00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.370
Please wait a moment.

556
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.530
Please continue to perform. The music can't stop.

557
00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:26.430
The dress costs several times more than your pay,

558
00:52:26.430 --> 00:52:30.020
so I'll just give you the dress.

559
00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.590
Instead, I wish you could take off your mask.

560
00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:40.060
Since you spilled red wine, of all things, it looks a bit grotesque.

561

<i>September, 1994</i>

562
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:59.800
- Oh, girl. You look disgustingly pretty. 
 - Right?

563
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.210
Thank you.

564
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:04.860
- Where are your parents? 
- I didn't ask them to come.

565
00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.960
- Why? 
- Because this is nothing big.

566
00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.800
What do you mean nothing big?

567
00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.620
You are performing after scoring first at this difficult competition.

568
00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.380
They wouldn't have come even if I asked them to.

569
00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.410
No way.

570
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:18.340
There isn't much time left until Ji Yeong's college entrance exams.

571
00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:23.990
Seriously, they're quite amazing. What about him?

572
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:26.540
He said he'll come after the rally.

573
00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.930
Does the world collapse if he misses one rally?

574
00:53:28.930 --> 00:53:30.720
They said it's a rally that won't work without him.

575
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.690
Those damned rallies.

576
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:36.030
He can't even protect his own girlfriend. How does he think he can protect the world?

577
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:40.090
A world he protects that way must be so beautiful. What a joke!

578
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.200
Oh, this makes me so angry.

579
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:45.770
Stop smiling.

580
00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:16.830
Sorry.

581
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:18.910
It's okay.

582
00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:22.720
- Where's your family? 
 - Ah...

583
00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.650
That question again.

584
00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:27.020
Ji Soo.

585
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.180
I didn't ask them to come.

586
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.830
Why?

587
00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.290
Because I won't see them in the future anymore.

588
00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.200
What are you saying?

589
00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:43.980
You taught me, Sunbae.

590
00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:04.640
To not let anyone treat me poorly.

591
00:55:10.510 --> 00:55:16.750
Because I am a very precious child of God.

592
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.790
I will not perform.

593
00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:35.030
Why? Because your face has been revealed?

594
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:38.150
No, because this is a pearl necklace hung around a swine's neck.

595
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.880
What?

596
00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:43.210
I'm saying that it's a waste of my luxurious performance to perform at such a tacky party

597
00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:46.470
that is only about showing off money. 
 <i>(T/N: she switched to informal speech)</i>

598
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.620
I'll be the one to pay for this dress. 
 <i>(T/N: informal speech)</i>

599
00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:07.050
<i>I'm not going to take it anymore.</i>

600
00:56:07.050 --> 00:56:09.620
<i>Getting hit by my father.</i>

601
00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.930
<i>Why did you get hit?</i>

602
00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:20.090
<i>I got caught listening to pop music.</i>

603
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:23.450
<i>He said that playing the piano is already laughable, and now I'm listening to entertainers' music.</i>

604
00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:26.420
<i>So he got mad and threw the radio.</i>

605
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.920
Sunbae.

606
00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.210
I want to see the ocean.

607
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:16.740
<i>Where do you think this is?</i>

608
00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:19.420
<i>How dare you come here?</i>

609
00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:21.650
<i>You devoured her.</i>

610
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.010
<i> If it wasn't for you. </i>

611
00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:27.410
<i>If it wasn't for you, she wouldn't have died!</i>

612
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.960
<i>Get out! Get out right now!</i>

613
00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.320
<i>I said to get out!</i>

614
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.210
I'm sorry, Ji Soo.

615
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:36.550
I'm sorry.

616
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.920
Sunbae.

617
00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.390
Why did I have to be the one to survive?

618
00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:56.120
To be alive is a sin and a debt.

619
00:58:57.190 --> 00:59:00.610
So I can't ever be happy

620
00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.380
and I can't ever complain.

621
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:08.320
Even if I live every day not having the time to sit down,

622
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.230
be it the price of my sin or my debt,

623
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:18.960
none of it becomes any smaller.

624
00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:23.200
Now,

625
00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:29.550
I really want to rest.

626
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.170
I want to let everything go.

627
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:05.680
<i>It's so romantic.</i>

628
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.910

 - Yes.

629
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.930
<i>But are we not going to eat eggs? What about soda?</i>

630
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:14.740
They sell boxed meals while going back and forth with a cart here, right?

631
01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:21.500
♫ <i>Someday, we'll probably</i> ♫

632
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.340
♫ <i>remember, right?</i> ♫

633
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:31.890
♫ <i>In another memory </i> ♫

634
01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:40.630
♫ <i>the promise we hid away</i> ♫

635
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:48.270
♫ <i>We were drunk on an exciting love at the time, with everything passing us by</i> ♫

636
01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:55.520
♫ <i> It must feel cold and lonely because those insignificant days were inelegant </i> ♫

637
01:00:55.520 --> 01:01:01.680
♫ <i>But it suddenly comes, the longing that is called "you"</i> ♫

638
01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:09.010
♫ <i>If we can go back to that time, I would tell you everything</i> ♫

639
01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:16.140
♫ <i>To that day, to that time, if we could go back</i> ♫

640
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:22.900
♫ <i>I could convey it all with just one embrace</i> ♫

641
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:30.110
♫ <i>If that day, if that time, even once it passes</i> ♫

642
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:38.210
♫ <i>Then it becomes tomorrow, no longer a memory</i> ♫

643
01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.580
I...

644
01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:57.480
I think that to those who survived, there is a reason for their living.

645
01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.900
That it's because there are things that only you can do in this world.

646
01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:15.200
So you being alive may be a blessing to us.

647
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:21.540
So Ji Soo, you can do it all.

648
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:27.650
You can rest, you can cry.

649
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:33.340
If you're having a hard time, you don't have to grit your teeth and endure it.

650
01:02:35.690 --> 01:02:38.580
Because I'll be by your side.

651
01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:55.130
Why would you be by my side?

652
01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:59.880
I should be in my place, and you should be in your place.

653
01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.600
That's right.

654
01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:05.750
Anyone would know that this was just an escape.

655
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:12.390
And even for a first love, we cannot justify an inappropriate relationship.

656
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:18.280
But why can't I turn away from you?

657
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:23.050
Why can't I leave us in my memories?

658
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:27.870
I kept thinking about it.

659
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.640
And I found that the answer was in our past.

660
01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.900
You said this.

661
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:39.570
Your belief,

662
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.230
your world is me.

663
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.100
There was something I couldn't say at the time.

664
01:03:56.790 --> 01:03:59.820
To me, you were my dream.

665
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:08.220
Now that I'm again facing the dream I had lost,

666
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.410
I found myself unable to throw it away

667
01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:19.910
nor run away.

668
01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:28.370
Because that's what a dream is.

669
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:44.750
Because it's a dream.

670
01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:53.760
Because you'll wake up from it soon.

671
01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:22.310
♫ <i>Spring is blossoming in our hearts</i> ♫

672
01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:28.920
♫ <i>My fluttering heart waits for you</i> ♫

673
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:34.680
♫ <i>Our fluttering gazes</i> ♫


675
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:41.540
<i>When My Love Blooms -  Preview</i>

676
01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:46.230
<i>Just a dream. Because it's all a dream.</i>

677
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:50.080
<i>You do know, don't you? That I've been with another man, too?</i>

678
01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.370
<i>So don't be so serious about it.</i>

679
01:05:52.370 --> 01:05:58.600
<i>They say that there are people who meet again in the end, no matter how.</i>

680
01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.590
<i>That black car behind us? How long has it been following us?</i>

681
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:05.300
<i>The thing I'm most afraid of, is that person being ruined because of me.</i>

682
01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:08.060
<i>I decided to avoid the thing I was most afraid of.</i>

683
01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:13.130
♫ <i>Our hearts are colored with autumn</i> ♫
