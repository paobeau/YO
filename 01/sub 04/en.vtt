<i>I can help you investigate this hacker.</i>

He's so sincere.

I'm so envious.

35
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.320
It's so romantic. When I was little, I watched "The Story of a Noble Family."

36
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.310
There's a scene where Yanxi runs to Leng Qingqiu's school.

37
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.640
He publicly confessed to her outside her dorm. The next day, all the girls in class were talking about that scene.

38
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.530
"The Story of a Noble Family?" Oh, the novel by Zhang Henshui?

39
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.800
She's talking about the drama, the one that China Network Television is always broadcasting reruns of.

40
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.870
All little girls love dramatic scenes like this.

41
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.210
When I was little, I really admired Leng Qingqiu. She got a bucket of water

42
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.190
and poured it on Yanxi from the window. It was so cool!

43
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.950
How is that cool?

44
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.480
She was so high up, but her aim was so accurate. How can that not be cool?

45
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.540
Go away.

46
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.770
Her aim is really accurate, too.

47
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.110
Don't, don't!

48
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.100
Child, go home.

49
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.730
Your clothes are all wet. Hurry home and change.

50
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.630
I spent so long preparing this.

51
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.310
Everyone, go back inside.

52
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.140
Do you guys have boyfriends or someone you like?

53
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.080
My grandpa wouldn't let me date early.

54
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.900
Whatever. If you were in ancient times, you'd be the mom of three kids already.

55
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.020
Dating is pointless. Cracking cases is so much more fun.

56
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.710
You're so good at cracking cases, you even caught your own friend.

57
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.500
Cai Yasi took revenge because you were mistreated,

58
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.940
and look what happened? He received a major demerit.

59
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.530
I didn't know he did it when I took the case.

60
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.790
It's because I'm too good at criminal investigation.

61
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.180
Speaking of him, your relationship with him is quite intriguing. Is something going on between you two?

62
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.220
What do you mean? It's not like you don't know how we were in high school. It's always been like this.

63
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.510
But I think he treats you differently.

64
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.100
Think about it. For you, he's willing to

65
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.600
hack into the freshman speech in a fit of anger, isn't that a bit too ambiguous?

66
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.720
What's ambiguous? Stop talking nonsense.

67
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.010
If you don't believe me, ask Xiao Lu. With her experience, she can definitely tell that something's up with you guys.

68
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.800
I don't know. I've never dated.

69
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.990
You seem like you've been in 100 relationships.

70
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.740
You also seem like you'd have an entire soccer team pursuing you.

71
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.990
Why are you guys so shocked? It's not like any of you are dating.

72
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.930
Me.

73
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.900
I'd have to believe you first. You're so lazy, why would you date anyone?

74
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.450
She's so lazy that she wants someone to go to the bathroom for her.

75
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.800
Male celebrities don't count as boyfriends.

76
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.120
I'm too lazy to talk to you guys.

77
00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.030
Focus on eating. Why are you on your phone?

78
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.760
Don't annoy me, I'm checking my email.

79
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.090
Checking your email for what?

80
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.220
I emailed my application to create the Detective Club to the  Student Association. It's been a few days already.

81
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.510
I still haven't received a response.

82
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.560
I told you not to start some dumb Detective Club; you refused to listen to me.

83
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.120
Say it again.

84
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.270
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

85
00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.200
You guys have such a good relationship. Cai Yasi is so scared of you that you guys will never fight.

86
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.840
How can he not be scared of me?

87
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:44.970
Because he got a major demerit, his mom took away half a month's living expenses. He's completely dependent on me now.

88
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.540
I have to be nice to you for now.

89
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.050
Big Sister Zhou Xiao.

90
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.910
Talk nicely, or I'll end our friendship.

91
00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.810
The VR cafe near the school has a new game. I want to go try it.

92
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.440
I don't have money.

93
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.510
Just ¥200. I promise I'll pay you back next month.

94
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.490
No way. I'm saving my money to use as the operating expenses for the Detective Club.

95
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.700
You haven't even created the club yet, what do you need operating expenses for?

96
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.620
Don't jinx my club.

97
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.260
You've been talking about it for three days now. There's no way you'll be able to create it.

98
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.640
Shut up. I'm going to go to the Student Association later.

99
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.750
You're going to the Student Association? Can you return some books for me?

100
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.530
Sure, no problem.

101
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.920
It's because our Studying Club has an activity later today.

102
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.030
Do you call that an activity? Staying in a room for 2 hours and only studying?

103
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.530
You guys are severing from the world of mortals to take refuge in religious life.

104
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.940
Don't be ridiculous.

105
00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.160
It is ridiculous.

106
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.230
Hurry up.

107
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.600
Why are you always going to the Student Association?

108
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.990
Don't you think the Student Association President is kind of weird?

109
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.490
Actually, I think so too.

110
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:03.240
Fanzhou, what are you doing here?

111
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.730
Oh right!  Did you see my self-introduction?

112
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.760
I saw it. It looks fine.

113
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.400
You're not going to interview the new students?

114
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.860
My group finished interviewing already.

115
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.180
I wanted you to interview me.

116
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.490
With your skills, it'll be the same no matter who interviews you.

117
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.860
Why do I feel like, even when I was giving the new student speech, I wasn't this nervous?

118
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.220
- Even though I only gave half of my speech. 
<i> - Is Jia Yichun here?</i>

119
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.220
Here! I'm going to go interview now.

120
00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.140
Good luck.

121
00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.020
I was also rejected by the Literature Club.

122
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.200
It's not just the Literature Club, right?

123
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.890
It's you? I was just about to go to the Student Association office. Where is it?

124
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.390
- It's over there. 
 - Thanks.

125
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.990
The Student Association is conducting interviews right now. What are you going there for?

126
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:08.180
I want to ask why my email to apply to create the Detective Club still hasn't received a reply.

127
00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.130
I saw your email.

128
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.790
The Student Association has been busy recruiting new students. We'll respond to you in a few days.

129
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.530
Really? Then did my application pass?

130
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.140
Why?

131
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.640
Your application only listed you. It doesn't meet the guidelines.

132
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.080
A club has to have at least five members.

133
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.160
That's easy. I can find enough members in half an hour.

134
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.220
Half an hour?

135
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:38.130
You're actually going to time me? Wait.

136
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.650
Hello, Cai Yasi?

137
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.890
<i>What?</i>

138
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.220
Join my Detective Club.

139
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:49.750
I don't want to. Your dumb Detective Club has caused me enough trouble already.

140
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.370
If you join, I'll let you go play the VR game.

141
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.220
Starting today,

142
00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.280
<i>you are my Club President. Whatever you say goes.</i>

143
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.320
Okay, bye.

144
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:04.200
Did you see that? In half a minute I got one member already.

145
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:12.330
Hello, Tao Ling? Join my Detective Club.

146
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.910
Why does Luo Wei have to be at the Studying Club right now? Her phone is off.

147
00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.650
You have one more minute.

148
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.190
Do you have to time me?

149
00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.020
Cai Yasi. Cai Yasi's roommates.

150
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.520
Time's up.

151
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.420
Then let's say I lost. I'll keep looking.

152
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.200
No need.

153
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:03.850
Be a nice person. Why must I find everyone in 30 minutes in order to create the club?

You? Why?

156
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.660
When we investigated the case together last time, it was pretty fun.

157
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.900
Right? I thought so, too. Give me five!

158

Yes!

159
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.950

Classmates, don't just look at my warm, handsome exterior.

162

When I'm training, I'm very strict.

163
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.940
Crying and running noses

164
00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.690

You're Zhu Lu, right?

167
00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.940
I'm sorry about last time.

168
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.280
But even though you're not my fan,

169
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.120
after you play against me, you'll fall head over heels in awe of my skills.

170
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:37.440
I think... that after you go home, you'll probably put my signed shirt on an altar.

171
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.810
How about it? Want to play a game?

172
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.690
Do you always talk so much before you play a game?
<i>(T/N: Lit. do you always recite scripture)</i>

173
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.280
It's a bit bright.

174
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.520
Xiao Lu, are you okay?

175
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.080
I'm okay. Thank you.

176
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.020
I'm sorry. I overestimated your skills, I thought you could return it.

177
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.860
Why don't you take a break? Let someone else play.

178
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.870
No need. Let's continue.

179

<i>He's not following me, is he?</i>

180
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.250
<i>He's probably just going this way, right?</i>

181
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.510
<i>It's such a big road, I must be overthinking it.</i>

182
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:18.960

<i>Son, help me get ahold of your dad. He won't reply to my WeChat messages.</i>

186
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:18.030
At this time, he should be at work. What's going on?

187
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.530
<i>Then tell him I'm making dinner.</i>

188
00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.710
<i>Tell him to come home soon.</i>

189
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.090
Okay, I'll tell him for you.

<i>Don't forget.</i>

191

This spray was given to me specifically by the team doctor. Here.

192

Most people won't be able to get it.

I don't need it, thanks.

194

It's really effective.

195
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.990
I'm giving it to you because I think highly of you.

196

You played really well.

197
00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:52.920
I don't need you to think highly of me.

198
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.810
Also, in the future, don't talk to me when you don't need to. We're not close.

199
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.370
Why are you like this? Can't you tell I'm concerned about you?

200
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:03.900
I can't tell. Why?

201
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:19.140
Xiao Lu, ice it for a while.

202
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:21.640
Thank you.

203
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.200
It seemed like you sprained your ankle earlier. Is it serious?

204
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.780
It's not serious. It's much better now.

That's good. Be more careful next time.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.820
Nothing.

312
00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:12.490
Can't you look at it more closely?

313
00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:15.220
I think it has lost its appeal recently.

314
00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.550
Because you have too much hair and it requires a lot of effort to tidy up.

315
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.630
Why do I need to clean up my hair?

316
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.330
To peel your scalp and anatomize your skull.

317
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:34.690
Got it! I'm sorry. I've offended you.

318
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.830
I'll leave right now.

319
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:56.310
Students, Lu Xun once said, "I thought all good poems

320
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.740
were completed during the Tang dynasty.

321
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:04.830
After that, Tang Fei who is like the Monkey King that escaped from the Buddha's hand no longer needed to fight."

322
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.610
Next, I'll briefly talk about the Tang and Song dynasty literature.

323
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.620
The Tang dynasty was a period of great prosperity in ancient China.

324
00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:15.530
The poems from the Tang dynasty are a perfect art form.

325
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:20.550
Before the Tang dynasty, what was the first style to appear?

326
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.750
Luo Wei, you say it.

327
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.490
The Shangguan style.

328
00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:33.020
Correct. Students,

329
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.000
you should all learn from Luo Wei.

330
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.010
This semester, Luo Wei has done very well.

331
00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.140
Thank you, Professor.

332
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.970
Because Luo Wei is so outstanding, I'll play a game with everyone.

333
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:48.460
The pitch-pot game of ancient times.

334
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.110
Pitch-pot is when the scholar-officials of ancient times...

335
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:54.270
Wei-wei, go ahead and throw it.

336
00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.570
It is also a type of ceremony. In the Tang dynasty,

337
00:28:57.570 --> 00:28:59.330
it was developed and promoted even more.

338
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.450
You guys shouldn't think that ancient culture is boring.

339
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:05.930
In fact, Chinese culture is very broad and profound.

340
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:09.140
- Almost, almost. 
 - As you learn more of its essence, you'll realize

341
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.860
it's not only interesting but also useful.

342
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.670
You guys saw that, right?

343
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:26.020
I just casually threw it and I made it.

344
00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:30.060
I think I might need to drop out of school. The Olympics need me.

345
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.810
Are you guys listening to me?

346
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.360
I'm listening. You're competing in the Olympics, right?

347
00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:41.820
I'm trying to think about how I can make it in.

348
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.230
I don't think you'll be able to think of it.

349
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.500
<i>When are you going to take me to the VR cafe?</i>

350
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.770
<i>What's Zhou Xiao doing? Why isn't she replying to me?</i>

351
00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:16.420
<i>Ask her for me. When is she going to take me to the VR cafe?</i>

352
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.290
Cai Yasi said you're not replying to his WeChat. He asked when you're going to take him to the VR cafe.

353
00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.330
Just ignore him.

354
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.970
I really think he's interested in you.

355
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.030
I think he's interested, too.

356
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.940
- Right? 
 - I think he's interested in taking my money.

357
00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:36.790
You don't believe me, right? If you don't believe me, let's do an experiment.

358
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:43.050
I'm telling you, I'm already familiar with the VR cafe. All the games inside...

359
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.110
<i>To determine if a guy likes you,</i>

360
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:48.490
<i>first, you need to see if he's willing to treat you well.</i>

361
00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.850
Cai Yasi, I'm hungry. Can you buy me a meal?

362
00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.300
Sure, my treat.

363
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.150
I thought you didn't have any money.

364
00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.120
If it's to treat you to a meal, it's okay even if I go bankrupt.

365
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.470
Then, where are you going to take me?

366
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:02.250
The cafeteria.

367
00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.400
What's wrong?

368
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.400
Never mind. Let's just go to the VR cafe.

369
00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.620
Are you disappointed because it's the cafeteria? What's wrong with the cafeteria?

370
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.910
It's clean and hygienic, and it's even a buffet. Doesn't it sound super high-quality?

371
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:22.170
She's single herself, why did I listen to Tao Ling?

372
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.750
Zhou Xiao! Zhou Xiao, are you deaf?

373
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.300
<i>Wait for me. Can't you hear me calling you?</i>

374
00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.440
<i>- Zhou Xiao! 
 - Let go of me.</i>

375
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.800
<i>I'm calling you!  Can't you hear me?</i>

376
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.380
<i>- Wait for me. 
 - Go away!  Don't follow me.</i>

377
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.760
<i>- Why are you so annoying? 
 - Wait for me.</i>

378
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.180
- I'll put on the headset for you. 
 - Wait.

379
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:51.640
Is it really not scary?

380
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.730
Don't worry, it won't be scary at all.

381
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:55.030
Okay, put it on.

382
00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.290
Lower your head and walk upstairs.

383
00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.650
Don't panic, I'm right next to you.

384
00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.010
Cai Yasi!

385
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.150
No! No, no, no!

386
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:14.510
Zhou Xiao, you're not scared.

387
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:31.700
Look at you. It's all fake.

388
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.840
You'll be fine after playing a few more times. When you see me play later, you'll know what I mean.

389
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:39.550
I finished setting up the new game. Two people can play it together.

390
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.000
But this new game can be kind of scary.

391
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.350
How scary can it be?

392
00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:47.120
You'll know after you guys try it out.

393
00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.620
Let's play it together.

394
00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.530
I can't. It's too scary.

395
00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.440
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

396
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.170
<i>Two, see if he will protect you in a dangerous situation.</i>

397
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.000
You're really going to protect me?

398
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.700
Of course.

399
00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.080
Okay.

400
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.530
Diatom testing is the most advantageous method of testing how the victim died from drowning.
<i>(T/N: diatom = algae)</i>

401
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:23.580
We can test to see if any internal organs contain diatoms in the corresponding water.

402
00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:28.140
Thus, we can determine if the victim died from drowning or was thrown into the water after death.

403
00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.410
<i>- Wait for me. 
 - Go away!  Don't follow me.</i>

404
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:36.000
Zhao Fanzhou, come explain why this is.

405
00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:44.650
Student Zhao Fanzhou, why are you spacing out during class?

406
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.560
Because if the victim drowned after death,

407
00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:50.090
even if submerged for a long period of time, diatoms cannot enter the body.

408
00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:55.020
Whereas if they died from drowning, diatoms will surely enter the victim's internal organs.

409
00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.750
Did you guys hear that?

410
00:33:57.750 --> 00:34:01.710
Zhao Fanzhou can space out during class and still listen to the lecture content.

411
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.870
Which of you can do that? Next.

412
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.350
Who's next?

413
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.000
I'll go next, Professor.

414
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:20.650
Is this your first time in the lab?

415
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.070
Remember.

416
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:38.340
Where are you putting your hands?

You better protect me.

I'm here. I'm shooting it.

427
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.510
On the left! The left!

428
00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.410
You scared me, stop screaming.

429
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.900
There's another one.

- Save me, save me, save me! 
 - Let go of me!

Cai Yasi, are you a human?

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.990
Left, right, top, bottom, you let me take all of them!

434
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:49.140
They're zombies. There were so many zombies, weren't you scared?

435
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.870
He said he would protect me. Tao Ling is hilarious.

What about Tao Ling?

437
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.120
Nothing. It's not important.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.970
Auntie, this... can you help me...

439
00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:12.540
Got it. For 415, right?

440
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.910
Yes!  Thank you, Auntie!

Zhou Xiao, does she not want my presents?

The way you give gifts, who would want them?

446

Besides, I remember you used to be a top student who only knew how to study.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.980
Why are you pursuing girls with this kind of method?

448
00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:42.110
It's not that, Zhou Xiao. Aren't you being too cruel?

449
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:46.140
That's why if you bring more things like this, I'll say even worse things.

Let me tell you! Downstairs, I caught the guy who's been giving you sanitary napkins.

He's my high school classmate.

I heard he was also going to Southern University,

- What's his name? 
 - Fang Wei.

He has really good grades, but he's a bit introverted.

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.840
I never thought he would do something like this. How did you two meet?

Don't worry. I already scolded him and sent him away for you.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.840
<i>Hello, this is Zhao Fanzhou.</i>

466
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.280
How did you get my phone number? Why did you call me?

467
00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.580
<i>I'm calling to let you know that your application to create a club has been approved.</i>

468
00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.540
It got approved? Okay, thanks. Bye-bye.

469
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.220
<i>Wait.</i>

470
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.270
<i>What is it? Is there something else?</i>

471
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:14.340
Have you thought of what to do for the first club activity?

472
00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.290
The club activity?

473
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.100
Let's just read detective novels together when we have time. That can be the club activity.

474
00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:24.880
I'm not a strict club president.

475
00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.230
Every club needs to have a club activity.

476
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:33.040
That's so troublesome. Okay, I'll think about it.

477
00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.090
That's it for now. Bye-bye.

478
00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:36.540
<i>Wait.</i>

479
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.620
What is it now?

480
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.190
You... save my phone number.

481
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:48.560
I don't think there's a need, right? We don't have much to talk about.

482
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.100
Because I'm also in the Detective Club.

483
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.680
Oh, sorry.

484
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.550
<i>I almost forgot. Okay.</i>

485
00:38:56.550 --> 00:39:00.630
Then when I think of an activity, I'll let you know. Bye-bye.

486
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:11.380
<i>[Teacher's Office]</i>

487
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.450
<i>- Professor, thank you for letting me register for electives during the weekend. 
 - No problem!  You can go back now.</i>

488
00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:17.620
<i>- Bye-bye. 
 - Bye-bye.</i>

489
00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:47.490
<i>[Chemical Laboratory]</i>

490
00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:08.640
<i>I thought he was bringing it for his girlfriend.</i>

491
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.840
<i>I didn't know he was a pervert.</i>

492
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.170
<i>But you should be careful when you're out and about these days.</i>

493
00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:19.920
<i>Young people these days have a lot going on in their minds.</i>

494
00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.430
<i>Okay.</i>

495
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.570
Zhou Xiao!

496
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.840
<i>He even called my name.</i>

497
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.020
No way. Is there anyone there?

498
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.980
<i>[Preview]
Treat me to a meal.</i>

499
00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.010
<i>The Detective Club!</i>

500
00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.820
<i>Open the door, Club President.</i>

501
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:34.130
<i>Could it be that you like her?</i>

502
00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:37.340
<i>I want to invite you to our Detective Club's club activity.</i>

503
00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:38.600
<i>Okay.</i>
