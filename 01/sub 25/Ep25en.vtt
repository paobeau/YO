(Previously on Episode 24)
I'm here to apply for suspending my schooling.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.060
My mom had a relapse.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.380
To be honest,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.580
I've liked her for a long time.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.020
Is there someone you miss very much?

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.580
Yes.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.780
Will you miss her greatly

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.260
but restrain yourself from going to see her?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.220
Yes.

Cai Yasi, what's wrong with you?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.540
Why are you so restless?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940
Xiao, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.380
Go away if you're sorry. Good.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.900
Come here.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.100
If so, then come here.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.780
Why?.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.660
Let me beat you and...

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:39.740
I will forgive you.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.580
But you just beat me.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.780
No. It was a kick.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:44.220
Then come on.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.580
OK.

Don't dodge.

You...

What are you looking at?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.140
Nothing.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.020
Nothing.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.980
I couldn't hit you. I couldn't.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.820
Give me my bag. I'm going back to my dorm.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.140
Go on, little madam. See you.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.780
What did you call me?

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.460
What did you call me?

Fanzhou.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.500
When did you come back from Beijing?

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.900
Today.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.860
Great.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.820
I was going

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.380
to go there to see Mrs. Zhao

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.620
as well as

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.980
tell you something.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.300
Fanzhou,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.700
how's Mrs. Zhao recovering?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.260
She's recovering well.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.980
Shall we have dinner together?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.500
It's my treat.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.220
I'm flying back to Beijing tonight.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.340
What? That's so quick.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.460
Is it because of Zhou Xiao?

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.580
None of your business.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.500
Fanzhou.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.820
I really have something to tell you.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.780
It's very important.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.900
I've only got thirty minutes.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.740
My dad and mom are going to immigrate.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.100
They want me to go with them

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.340
and apply for another college there.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.940
That's pretty good.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.660
Do you really think so?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.580
I'm no longer

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.740

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.260
If you need me,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.380
I can bravely stay here for you.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:50.660
At that time

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.300
I was too cowardly

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.140
to stand up for you.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.380
That's why we failed to be together.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.820
I wish you wouldn't make

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.100
any decision for me.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.340
But you know I like you.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.820
Why...

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.020
Because I don't like you.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.700
I'm off.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.780
You still like her, don't you?

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.660
Answer me.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.500
It's no business of yours who I like.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.140
You and Zhou Xiao have broken up.

but not Zhou Xiao.

if you still had affection for me.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.380
If you had it,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:01.780
you would open the mail

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.140
and know the truth.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.860
If you didn't have it,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.500
you would be in the dark forever.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.580
You're furious now, aren't you?

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.580
I don't want to see you ever again.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.580
Now that

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.940
you'll never love me,

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:46.060
it's not a bad thing to be hated by you.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.620
Mom,

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.620
what do you want to talk about?

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.660
We have a plane to catch.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.380
I want to talk with you

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.300
about the reason you broke up with Zhou Xiao.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:03.860
It's been such a long time.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.420
There's no need to talk about that.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.620
It was because of

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.140
that genetic testing report, wasn't it?

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.700
How did you know?

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.700
I read it in the toilet.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.020
And just now I eavesdropped when you talked

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.460
with Yichun by phone.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.500
Mom,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.060
don't...

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.940
No, no, no.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.020
I'm okay.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.220
I just think I was being

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.060
a burden on you again.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:38.900
Don't think like that.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.460
It's my fault.

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:44.020
Fanzhou,

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.300
what are you going to do now?

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.180
Actually,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.340
I went back to the school
to see Zhou Xiao before.

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:57.020
She's quite happy now

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:00.300
and I was the one who ended our relationship.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.460
I don't want to ruin her quiet life.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.900
That's so untypical of you.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.020
I got well and now you're sick?

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.300
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.580
Actually I know

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.980
not everyone

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.300
is eligible to be a parent.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:28.900
Your dad and I quarreled all the time.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.820
We didn't let you grow up
in a good environment

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:33.340
and now

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.660
we even affected your relationship.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.500
I'm really sorry.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.980
Mom.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:48.180
Actually I've been thinking a lot

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.980
for a period of time.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.020
Your dad and I have stopped

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.140
loving each other long ago.

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.740
It's pointless for us to go on like that.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.740
So splitting up is a good choice.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.940
But you're different.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.540
I know you really like Zhou Xiao.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.420
You can't give up.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.380
What are you hesitating about?

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.380
Try your best to get her back.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.980
I'm especially experienced in that.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.860
I'll teach you, alright?

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.100
Mom,

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:22.660
it seems you've really recovered.

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.740
You're so annoying.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.540
I like Zhou Xiao very much

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.100
and so do you.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.540
Chase after her again.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.460
I support you.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:29.180
It's raining

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.780
and you want me to get your takeouts
at the back door?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.180
No, I'm not going.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.900
Ask Fang Wei to get them.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.860
The boys' dorm is closer to the back door.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.580
Why should I go there?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.020
I'm not going. Bye-bye.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:42.580
I'll hang up now.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:06.660
Zhou Xiao.

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.060
It's been a long time.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.500

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.460
Yes, indeed.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.780
I came back to school.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.540
Congratulations.

what's up with her?

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.180
Zhao Fanzhou is back.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.900
He dared to come back?

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.420
Where's he? I'll go and kick his ass now.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.620
Can you help me

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:19.060
kick Fang Wei's ass as well?

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.980
He didn't even have time
to fetch takeouts for me.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.620
I got it in the rain myself.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.740
Forget about it, Lu.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.420
I'm going to sleep.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:30.020
Change your wet clothes first.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.300
They're just a bit wet.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.820
The heat

00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:42.060
in my quilt will dry them.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:45.340
Fool.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.340
Have a good sleep.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.060
We need to prepare the exhibition tomorrow.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.500
Fanzhou.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.780
Give me a hug.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.740
You finally came back.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:00.900
I'm back.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.660
You won't leave this time, will you?

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:08.140
It's a great thing you came back.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.060
In order to keep your bed,

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.380
I have done

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.700
everything I could

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.780
and I almost fought with the dorm keeper.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.900
Thanks.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.940
If you come back to have classes now,

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.420
we'll be in the same grade, won't we?

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.980
The school has agreed

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:30.060
that as long as I pass the make-up exams,

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.740
I'll be able to be a senior directly.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.620
Boring.

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:41.700
Okay.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.980
I'll buy breakfast for you and your roommates

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:47.100
on my way to the library

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.940
tomorrow morning.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.380
Muah.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.580
What are you doing tomorrow?

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.020
Tell me now.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:14.500
It's alright.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.820
Fix it with something.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.140
Don't let it come loose.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.180
How come only you two are here?

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.300
Where are the others?

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.700
The exhibits are not enough.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.740
Lu and Xie Yixing have gone to the
Department of Art to make some.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.020
Tao Ling and Fang Wei seem to have left.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.100
Come down here. I'll go up.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.060
You're so talkative.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.940
Are you cosplaying as my dad?

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.700
My dear daughter,

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.500
come down.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:47.700
Come down here.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:48.580
No.

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.340
Are you okay?

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:01.700
Are you okay?

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.660
Don't go.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.060
What are you doing, Luo Wei?

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.660
You need to give them some space

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.020
and let them have a talk.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.420
I'm looking out for you.

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.300
Don't always play gooseberry.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.260
It's bad for your health.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.260
Help me hang these things up.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.820
How?

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:35.460
This. Move this there first.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:46.900
You finally came to see me.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:51.580
Where were you?

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.220
Tao Ling,

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.060
let me explain.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.060
Zhou Xiao, I have something to tell you.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:07.500
Shut up.

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.260
Tao Ling and Fang Wei are quarreling outside.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.500
It'll be awkward if they know we're here.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.700
I'm sorry.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.180
I've done the wrong things.

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:25.740
What are they?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:26.780
I

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:29.180
should have helped you with your takeouts

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.060
and the exhibition.

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:31.780
And?

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.140
I should have gone shopping,

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.740
watched the movie and eaten with you.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.300
But I really have

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.380
my reasons.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.460
I was too busy with the project
my tutor assigned.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.180
I haven't had a good sleep for a week.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:48.340
You deserve it.

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.620
But I came

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.780
to see you

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.700
as soon as I completed the project,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.420
instead of catching up on my sleep.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.340
Haven't I admitted

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.620
my mistakes very sincerely?

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.100
I'll think about

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.180
how I should judge you.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:06.060
Don't answer it.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.660
It's my tutor. Don't be childish.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.700
Mr. Li.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.540
Okay.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:19.540
I'll be right there.

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.860
Fang Wei,

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.540
I haven't agreed to let you leave yet.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.660
Can I go now?

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.620
We'll break up if you dare to go.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.180
Okay.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.860
It's the first time he has agreed
to break up with me.

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.500
I'm sorry, Zhou Xiao.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.140
It's okay. I forgive you.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.460
I want to start over with you.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.660
Are you sick?

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:22.700
I thought I was.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.780
What do you mean?

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.660
My mom's manic depression

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:30.980
could be inherited.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.900
I had a genetic test in Beijing

00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.060
and the results showed

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:39.540
my probability of having the disease

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:40.900
was 41.1 times.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.620
And... and then?

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.300
Then I broke up with you.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.900
But I didn't know until yesterday

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:55.660
that Jia Yichun

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.100
changed my test results.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.660
I'm actually not at risk of that disease.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:05.820
Okay.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:06.980
Got it.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:10.220
Zhou Xiao.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:18.140
You didn't tell me when you knew

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.540
you may fall ill.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.740
You only wanted to break up with me.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:24.620
As your girlfriend,

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:26.900
couldn't I even know about this matter?

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.300
You have been living a happy life
since your childhood.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:38.860
I was not sure

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.380
whether I could give you
such happiness or not back then.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.060
Even if there's a possibility of 0.01%

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:46.820
that I'm unable to give you happiness,

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.180
I shouldn't get you implicated

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.420
and let you share my burden.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.220
But have you thought about this?

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.380
I wouldn't be happy without you.

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.300
Sorry.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:11.500
So in your mind I'm not the one

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.740
you can share your sufferings with.

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.060
When you got into difficulties,

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.500
I was the first person you gave up.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.460
I thought I did some wrong things.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:23.580
So I didn't do anything wrong.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.460
I'm sorry.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.500
Let's just leave it at that.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.380
Your alarm.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.860
Your alarm.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.220
Turn off your alarm.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.420
My head aches.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:27.020
Mine aches, too.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.740
We drank too much yesterday.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.940
Get up now.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.060
We have things to do later.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:36.820
How are Zhou Xiao and Tao Ling?

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.140
I don't know. Check on them.

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:51.620
Lu,

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.580
Tao Ling and Zhou Xiao

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.100
are not in their beds.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.780
Would they do anything to themselves

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.340
because of their relationship problems?

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.180
Zhou Xiao is really an amazing girl.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.580
She loves her detective career so much.

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.340
After doing an experiment

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.140
all night and having

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.500
breakfast here,

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.780
will you feel energetic again

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.020
and have an impulse to go back to the lab?

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.500
No.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:35.460
It's been over a year
but you're still so boring.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:37.620
If you weren't so competent,

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.300
I would've been through with you long ago.

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.740
Fanzhou, here.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.740
What did you call him for?

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:46.900
Professor.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.580
He's my roommate, Xie Yixing.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:50.460
Hello, Professor Hu.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.340
This is his girlfriend,

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.940
Lu.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.180
Hello, professor.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:55.980
Are you the professor

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.940
who didn't allow

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:59.460
Zhao Fanzhou to go back
to his dorm and sleep?

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:01.340
Exactly.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.780
And you are the person
who called him a dozen times

00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:06.740
a night and constantly

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.180
interrupted our experiment, his roommate,

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:10.980
Xie Yixing?

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.300
Yes, that's me.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.020
Professor,

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.060
let's eat.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:19.940
Let's eat, too.

00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.380
(Notifications)

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:38.460
(An earthquake hits near
Nanshi Economic Development Zone)

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:40.420
Eat faster.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:42.300
We have to go to the library.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.780
What's the rush?

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.420
Let's wait for Fanzhou.

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.220
He must want to go as well.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.020
Zhou Xiao will be there, after all.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.260
Zhou Xiao doesn't want to see him.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.620
Lu, don't talk like that.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.980
Zhao Fanzhou is my friend.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.820
Let him go for my sake.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:07.740
Right.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.580
Don't go to the library.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.140
You're not welcomed there.

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:17.420
What happened? You broke up with Zhou Xiao?

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.980
Don't you like her very much?

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.980
He was in difficulty.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.180
Still we're not forgiving him.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.380
Right. We won't forgive you.

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.180
Have you finished eating?

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:43.980
Let's get going.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.140
Professor, we're off.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.540
Bye-bye, professor.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.340
You've been unpopular

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:03.180
after you came back.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:10.180
Xiao,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.660
help me check if Fang Wei is here.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:18.220
Nope.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:19.780
What?

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:21.500
Seriously?

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.060
He didn't come here.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:25.660
Is he really going to break up with me?

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:28.020
Why did you avoid him
since you miss him so much?

00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:29.060
Well,

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.780
my eyes are swollen.

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.420
I don't want him to see this.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.260
We cried together yesterday.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.100
How come my eyes are swollen

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:40.180
and nothing happened to yours?

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:42.500
It may be because I cry a lot

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:43.660
and I've been well trained.

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:46.180
I really can't see what you cried for

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.100
when your ex begged to be with you again.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:49.660
I'm the one who's pitiful.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.060
If so, just talk with Fang Wei

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.500
and don't be childish again.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:55.820
No.

00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.060
The one who apologizes first will lose.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.220
It's a matter of principle.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.380
How can you have so many bad arguments?

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.740
You don't believe me, do you?

00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:03.420
Look.

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:04.620
The one who lost is here.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:16.900
I bought you both breakfast.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.140
No, thanks.

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:20.220
You don't have time to buy breakfast.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.340
Take it.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.620
We don't need to have breakfast.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.780
Take it.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.180
I bought your favorite, cabbage dumplings.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.100
I don't like cabbage dumplings anymore.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.100
Don't follow me.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.580
You're such a heartless woman.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:36.500
Zhao Fanzhou was

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.380
such a pitiful sight

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.620
and you still turned him down.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.940
Just go. Don't talk rubbish.

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.180
My stuffed buns.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.380
I'll buy some for you.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.780
You've done so much work.

00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:55.980
What took you two so long?

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.940
Aren't you too late?

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980
I need to talk to you.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:02.340
Tao Ling,

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.220
come and help me.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:08.780
If this is a TV play,

00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:10.580
Zhou Xiao will absolutely

00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.100
be the heroine.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:18.460
What did Zhao Fanzhou say to you yesterday?

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.740
I've answered you a hundred times.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.020
Did you accept his apology?

00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:26.380
No,

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.940
honestly.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.140
Why are you here?

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:47.340
I came to help you.

00:34:49.340 --> 00:34:50.460
We don't need your help.

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:53.820
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:55.300
you're back.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.740
Ms. Huang.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.540
Can I help you with your exhibition?

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:01.540
Of course. Welcome.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.460
Thanks, Ms. Huang.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:05.100
Come on. Start working.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:14.900
Stop watching.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.060
Get back to work.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:42.340
Give me one of those.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:46.780
I'll help her.

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:47.780
You go there.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:14.180
Thanks.

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:15.100
No problem.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:24.100
There.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:24.900
Be careful.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.140
Oh,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.300
fetch me the bronze inscription, "Dog".

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.100
Be careful not to fall off the ladder.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:30.580
Mm.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.260
Which one?

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:35.620
The one that looks like a dog.

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.020
They all look like dogs.

00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:39.260
So do you.

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.300
Yes, that's it.

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.500
Thanks.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.460
It's so beautiful.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:02.860
Let's go.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.940
What are you two

00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:29.260
doing?

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.420
Well,

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:38.420
excuse me for a moment.

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:53.660
Don't call him.

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:55.300
Call him.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.300
Don't call him.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.020
This is driving me crazy.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.180
Shall I call him or not?

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.620
I just can't decide.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.620
Tao Ling,

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.540
what are you doing?

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.020
I didn't call Fang Wei.

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.860
You two quarreled again?

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:15.860
Call him if you want to.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.300
Go downhill when you need to.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:20.660
Wait not till only uphill roads are left.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.660
Don't just tease me.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.060
It's been two years
and you've made no progress.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:28.820
Zhao Fanzhou achieved more
than you in two days.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:31.300
What did he achieve?

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.500
Just now

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:34.820
Zhou Xiao went out.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.340
I saw Zhao Fanzhou going out as well.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.100
And you're still standing here.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.060
Where did they go?

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.540
How should I know
this kind of private matter?

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:04.460
Go away.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.860
Zhou Xiao, I have...

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:06.980
I know you have something to say

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.020
but I don't wanna hear it.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.020
How long are you gonna follow me?

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:11.340
Is this interesting to you?

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.900
Ms. Huang asked me

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.460
to look for some ancient characters with you.

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:19.580
We need more about animals.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:21.460
That's better for students
from the Department of Art

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.260
when they're making characters.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.140
Oh.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:13.340
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:55.220
What's he doing?

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:11.340
Cai Yasi,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:12.780
what are you looking for?

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.940
It seems a pile of books
hasn't been put away yet.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:18.780
I came back to check it.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.700
I'll go and handle those books.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.260
Mm.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:39.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.660
Zhou Xiao.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:43.700
What?

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.420
Come and have a look.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:51.740
What shall I look at?

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:52.900
Some characters.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.300
What do you want me to look at?

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:07.700
(I'm sorry. Please give me one more chance.)

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:13.980
I don't understand.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.540
Read the first characters on these books.

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:21.900
You've done this before.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.580
See? When you line them up,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.540
they become a thrilling detective story

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.620
with a twist of

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.460
kinship.

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:31.780
Have I?

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:33.620
I don't remember that.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.340
I'm sorry.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.140
Please give me one more chance.

00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:51.180
Put the books back in their places.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:52.900
Otherwise, other students won't be able

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.780
to find them according to their bar codes.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:56.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:57.940
Put them back.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.940
Where are you going?

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:14.460
Look for the characters yourself.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.140
I don't want to stay with you.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.940
Emergency. Emergency.

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:40.220
The earthquake agency warned

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.900
that a 4.3-magnitude earthquake
is striking the city.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.620
Staff in closed places,

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.300
please evacuate students right away.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.340
Don't take the elevator. Use the stairs.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.940
Don't panic. Don't push and shove.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.860
Mind where you're treading. Don't fall over.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:56.460
Withdraw quickly and safely.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.260
Emergency. Emergency.

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:00.700
The earthquake agency warned

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.180
that a 4.3-magnitude earthquake
is striking the city.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.980
-Zhou Xiao.
-Staff in closed places,

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.540
-please evacuate students right away.
-Zhou Xiao.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.660
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.580
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:14.740
Come with me.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:17.100
Leave right now.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:17.780
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:18.980
Zhao Fanzhou, don't go in.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.140
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.900
-Use the stairs. That way.-Zhou Xiao.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.420
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:28.860
Zhou Xiao.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.060
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:32.260
go outside now!

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.980
Quickly. Don't panic.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.060
Quick. Be careful.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:42.620
Hurry up.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:45.820
Be careful. Mind the steps.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:46.900
Were you hurt?

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.260
Slowly.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:50.780
Slowly.

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.500
Did anything hit you?

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.620
No. I'm okay.

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.100
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.740
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:00.300
What's wrong?

00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.940
Be careful. Quickly.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:02.620
Hey.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.540
Come back, Zhou Xiao.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.900
Be careful.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.980
Cai Yasi, what are you doing?

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.020
Ms. Huang, she went in.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:09.900
You can't go, Cai Yasi.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:10.700
Cai Yasi,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:11.500
you can't go.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.660
Cai Yasi!

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.100
Be careful.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:21.060
Zhou Xiao.

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.900
Zhou Xiao.

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:24.540
Zhou Xiao.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.180
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:28.900
I'm here.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:29.940
Be careful!

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.460
Are you okay?

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:43.500
Are you okay?

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.260
Yes.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.420
Let's go.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.460
Come on.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:49.220
Go to a safe place.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.500
Zhou Xiao,

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.380
where's Cai Yasi?

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.340
We didn't see him just now.

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:56.940
Zhou Xiao,

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:58.220
are you okay?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:58.780
Yes.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.740
Cai Yasi just went inside to look for you.

00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:02.020
I'll look for him.

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.540
You stay here. I'll go.

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.540
Cai Yasi, here.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.460
You scared me to death.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.420
Are you okay?

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:24.900
Of course.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.100
I'm a lucky guy.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:26.980
I wasn't hurt a little bit.

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.300
You weren't hurt a little bit

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:31.140
but Zhao Fanzhou...

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.060
Fanzhou, what happened to your shoulder?

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:34.060
Go to the hospital.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:34.940
What is it?

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:37.580
Don't look at it.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.460
I'm okay. I just bled a bit.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.660
Let me have a look at it.

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:42.100
Don't. You'll faint at the sight of blood.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.060
Go to the hospital.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.740
No. I'll handle it myself.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.220
Do you think you're a gibbon?

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.100
We're off.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.300
There must be lots of people
at the campus hospital.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:50.820
I'd better not go there.

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:51.420
Are you going or not?

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:53.980
Yes.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.180
Aren't you going with me?

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.060
Go there yourself.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.580
Go.

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.660
I'll go if you turn around.

00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.700
Fine. I'll go with you.

00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:11.980
I'll take him to the hospital.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.060
Go.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.140
Perhaps we're really not

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:04.940
suitable for each other.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.700
Come and have lunch with me.

Just the two of us.

00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:08.500
OK.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.340
Fanzhou,

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.380
why do you suddenly come back?

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.540
In my son's mind,
