Yes, hello.

I'm the father of Kwon Hyeok Soo, who died unjustly because of you.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.620
Sir. Come to your senses.

21
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.470
You were arrested on the scene and with the weapon, so the warrant will be issued right away.

22
00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.300
If the victim dies, you will be indicted for murder without delay.

23

If you know a lawyer, you should call that person right now.

- Are you his guardian? 
 - Pardon?

What happened?

30
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.630
He is the father of an employee who suicided some years ago.

31
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.410
He sued the Vice President not long ago and lost the case.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.400
It seems he was harboring a grudge over this matter.

And what about him?

34

My apologies.

37
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.630
Then this happened while Jae Hyeon was alone?

38
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.250
I was together with him.

<i>Okay, I got it. </i>

42
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.820
Come back home, you too. Will anything change because you're there?

43

What if he doesn't wake up?

48
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.550
Why are you crying out here, instead of going inside?

49
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.970
I called the ambulance right away, but... He'll be fine, right?

50
00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.790
It's all right.

51
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.720
It took me some time to find my phone and call. He'll really be fine, right?

52
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.700
What will happen to him?

53
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.520
He will wake up for sure.

Yes, he will.

why he needs to wake up.

57
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.250

- Is there some kind of problem? 
 - No, it's not that.

- He has been moved to a ward but he's not yet awake. 
 - Why?

105
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.060
They said it's because everyone's recovery speed is different.

They said it went well.

130
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:37.920
All that is left is for him to wake up. Don't worry too much.

132

Does it look like I've been well?

133
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:09.130
Is seems like Jae Hyeon was overly loyal and he did things he wasn't asked to.

134
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.900
And with that, he made himself enemies everywhere.

135
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.030
It seems like you're uncomfortable, I'll come back later.

136

This is a very good opportunity for us.

137
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:39.130

138
00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.880
Dad.

139
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.210
Even if he's just a hunting dog like you said, shouldn't you <i>not</i> be doing this?

140
00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.140
Then what do we do?

141
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.290
It's exactly because he was acting as your hunting dog that he ended up like that.

142
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.390
If you look after him with your most earnest devotion,

143
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:58.320
do you think that when he wakes up he'll want to work things out with you?

144
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.510
Do you think he'll say, "I'll live as a loyal hunting dog for the rest of my days"?

145
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:06.240
Get your head on straight.

146
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:09.600
There may not be guns involved but this is a battlefield.

147
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:22.760
I was worried that you'd live a lonely, sad life like your father.

148
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:29.910
So I pretended not to notice, even if you lived as if you were another person.

149
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.170
But it looks like that came back to you in this way.

150
00:20:54.530 --> 00:20:58.200
I know that you were in charge of the lawsuit filed by the elder who was doing a one-man protest.

151
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.580
What about that?

152
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.000
That man stabbed Jae Hyeon.

153
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.130
I'm aware of this. It was on the news.

154
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:10.180
The news didn't say who the culprit was.

155
00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.310
This won't just pass by without a hitch.

156
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.870
Are you implying that I did something?

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.640
he just turned around and sighed. He's that kind of person.

159
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.340
He's not someone who would deliberately chase after a person to harm them.

160
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.140
Are you his family member?

161
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.120
How many times have you seen him that you are this certain?

162
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.770
We'll just have to see about that.

163
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:34.650
Did you come here to threaten me?

164
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:38.670
No, I came here to confirm something.

165
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:07.200
<i>Hello, Sir. I went out to get a drink and I'm calling you from there.</i>

166
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.150
<i>I saw someone I wasn't happy to see.</i>

167
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.890
<i> Han Jae Hyeon seems to be living a nice life as usual.</i>

168
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:20.760
<i>This is a bar in front of Hyeong Seong headquarters.</i>

169
00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.260
<i>Yes.</i>

170
00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.190
Are you okay?

171
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.650
You had surgery. Do you feel pain anywhere?

172
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:22.820
Are you looking for someone?

173
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.950
There's no point looking for her. She can't come here.

174
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.750
As of now, I'm still your wife and it's my duty to nurse you.

175
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.040
You can't stay in a hotel in your current state.

176
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:47.460
If you're really worried, I'll deliver the message.

177
00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.930
that you woke up.

178
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.370
Should I tell her?

179
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:07.900
- No. 
 - I understand.

180
00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:11.330
I'll go get Joon Seo and bring him here. In the meantime, keep Jae Hyeon company.

181
00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.420
I understand.

182
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.870
In Kwon Pil Ho's call history,  you should find Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

183
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:25.170
We already looked through his call record, of course. Did you come all the way here to say this?

184
00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.750
I'm here to tell you about Lee Se Hoon's relationship

185
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.310
with both parties involved in this case.

186
00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:45.390
<i>I'm the father of Kwon Hyeok Soo, who died wrongfully because of you.</i>

187
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.500
You shouldn't sit up yet, though.

188
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.170
- It's time for you to go home. 
 - It's alright, I'm okay.

189
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:59.890
I'm not okay.

190
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.530
Does love change?

191
00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.180
What on earth are you talking about?

192
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:10.540
Why do you keep putting up a wall with me?

193
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.440
I'm feeling distressed by the fact that I didn't protect you.

194
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.560
So please don't push me away.

195
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.960
It seems like you are able to understand me now.

196
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.330
Then I'll step outside for a while.

197
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.040
I'm going to come back.

198
00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:10.420
Come here, Joon Seo.

199
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.150
Why are you crying?

200
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:20.630
Dad, I thought you were going to die.

201
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:27.300
I didn't die, so stop crying. Come here.

202
00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.970
My dear son.

203
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:28.180
I am here as Kwon Pil Ho's lawyer, the suspect in Han Jae Hyeon's assault.

204
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:30.500
Have a seat.

205
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.080
- Lee Se Hoon? 
 - Yes.

206
00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.790
You can't be Kwon Pil Ho's lawyer.

207
00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.300
What do you mean?

208
00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:49.580
We had planned to summon you as a testifier, actually.

209
00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.720
You made a phone call with Mr. Kwon Pil Ho two hours before the event, is that right?

210
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.100
I called to see how he was doing. Is that a problem?

211
00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.040
If it's his last call before the assault, then it is indeed a problem.

212
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.110
There was discord between you and the victim, too.

213
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:15.180
I'm on my way to your house, so come out in around ten minutes.

214
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:29.420
Will you really not go?

215
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.380
They said he woke up, why would I go there? It's not like I'm a doctor.

216
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.720
And I am?

217
00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.070
If you're going to beat yourself up and tear your hair out, let's go together before you get bald.

218
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:42.170
I won't. My hair is precious.

219
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.320
Will you really be okay if you don't to go?

220
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.210
Alright, don't worry about anything.

221
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:53.380
The way I see it, he'll soon be on his feet and be running everywhere.

222
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.220
Go on.

223
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.760
He woke up. He's awake.

224
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.690
I kept telling them not to come, but they still did.

225
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.210
- Why would you come all the way here? Seriously. 
 - They have a beautiful heart.

226
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:17.350
It's so embarrassing.

227
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:21.110
Why did you come all the way here, really? Welcome, anyway.

228
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.140
Ji Soo couldn't come.

229
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.190
Something came up.

230
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:30.420
- Doesn't your stomach hurt? 
 - Of course it does.

231
00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.180
I'm okay.

232
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.630
Isn't it something where you need a good fart to get it over with?

233
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:40.280
- Sunbae, come on. 
 - What? This is really important!

234
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.540
- When you get your stomach cut open and sewn back, it's important to let it out, be it a small or a big one. 
 - That's enough.

235
00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:48.220
Let's take a picture together, to celebrate you getting better.

236
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.420
What are you talking about? Why a picture, out of the blue?

237
00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:54.200
I've become addicted to social media these days, you see. Okay, anyway.

238
00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.140
- Gather around, quick. 
 - Why take a picture in front of a bedridden person? 
 - Come on, gather around.

239
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:04.590
- Ah seriously, so annoying. 
 - Look here, one, two three.

240
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.040
<i>Sunbae looks alright, see? </i>

241
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.220
<i>Incoming call: Jang Seo Kyeong</i>

242
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:39.700
Yes?

243
00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.220
<i> I'm in front of your house. Can you come out for a moment? </i>

244
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.270
What is it about?

245
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.760
Jae Hyeon woke up.

246
00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:03.280
If you were worried to death like this, how did you manage to stay apart all this time?

247
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.060
Did that happen while you were with Jae Hyeon?

248
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.560
You can resent me.

249
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.420
If I'd only gone there a bit earlier...

250
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.290
I could have prevented it.

251
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.860
Had I known there was someone like you,

252
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:39.260
then I wouldn't have chased after Jae Hyeon from the start.

253
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.620
I'm sorry.

254
00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.070
I realize that I've never properly apologized to you.

255
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.400
I am really sorry.

256
00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.370
If you are sorry, please give up.

257
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.230
I'm also tired of saying this,

258
00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:16.130
but then I won't throw hostilities and I'll stop tormenting the people around you.

259
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:22.310
I am desperately asking this of you.

260
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.470
I can also get on my knees.

261
00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:29.410
If I get on my knees, will you give up?

262
00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.130
There's something I promised to Sunbae.

263
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:43.630
That I would never disappear without a word.

264
00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:51.590
That we wouldn't be thrust apart, be it by fate or by someone else.

265
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.080
Then just live like that.

266
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.750
Since I can't ever give up either.

267
00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:31.840
Stay home at least until you are fully recovered.

268
00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.770
I'll stay at my mother's house.

269
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.590
It'll be hard on you to go back and forth there.

270
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:38.740
I think it's better.

271
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.840
Is it because of Yoon Ji Soo?

272
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:50.060
She said she'd give you up.

273
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.370
I met her to tell her that you woke up.

274
00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:01.030
She said that you getting stabbed and you're family being wrecked

275
00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:03.630
all felt like it was her fault.

276
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.730
Really. She said she will leave.

277
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.280
I'll stay at my mother's house.

278
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.340
My mother wishes I can be by her side, too.

279
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.640
Are you not going to contact Yoon Ji Soo?

280
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:26.360
She seemed very shocked.

281
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:29.970
She was at the scene with you, and she got on the ambulance as well.

282
00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:32.850
She cried a lot.

283
00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.120
Do you really think she said she would leave?

284
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:44.720
That can't be true.

285
00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.540
But I want to first put down my burden, and then take my time to see her.

286
00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:54.370
I should first see my mother, the elderly man, and Chairman Jang.

287
00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:57.450
As expected. Elders first.

288
00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.980
You've grown up, uh?

289
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.340
Why did you come again today?

290
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.070
I'm stuck to you like chewing gum.

291
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.190
Thank you for all you did, Ji Soo.

292
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.610
I know you've been going to my house every day.

293
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:19.870
And I know you gathered signatures for the petition, too.

294
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.850
I've been so busy these days that I couldn't take care of the lawsuit.

295
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.400
I plan on getting back to it. Everything is ready.

296
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.000
I can take over now, really.

297
00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.310
Well, that's one thing.

298
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:37.170
On that day, you went to meet him, right?

299
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:43.130
The day you kept looking at the clock of the hospital ward.

300
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:45.780
Yes.

301
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.780
And you two, it's true?

302
00:35:54.010 --> 00:36:00.420
I didn't even know that and was cursing him out, called him vicious and a bad guy. You must have hated me in your head.

303
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.180
I didn't.

304
00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.160
Everything you said was true, after all. He's vicious and a bad guy.

305
00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:13.190
How did you manage to fight all this time? Against the person you love.

306
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:17.550
I learned to fight like that.

307
00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.110
And since I learned that when I was young, it's even harder to unlearn.

308
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:26.010
Who was your teacher? That person must have had very firm teaching ways.

309
00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.800
<i>Jae Hyeon was discharged. </i>

310
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:45.170
We should be careful that Joon Seo's feelings don't get hurt too much.

311
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:53.170
I'm scared he'll go around doing mean things again, if his father isn't around.

312
00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.420
I won't bury myself in work like I used to.

313
00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:02.870
I plan on hanging out and playing with him more often than when we lived together.

314
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:09.440
No matter how much you do for him, it'll always feel windy in his heart.

315
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.670
I'll probably come here often with Joon Seo.

316
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.520
Would you?

317
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:25.920
When I'm here like this, I feel like the wind is calming down and my mind becomes at ease.

318
00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.690
My mom is so pretty.

319
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:44.830
<i>A happy correction for a happy nation.</i>

320
00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:06.110
I lost my mind at the thought of my son and my wife.

321
00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:16.680
Elder, my father also passed away like your son.

322
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.800
He was working at Hyeong Seong as well.

323
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:30.160
He liked people and cherished the company that allowed him to see these people every day.

324
00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:35.780
For the people he liked and the company he cherished,

325
00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.850
he worked extremely hard.

326
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.420
He went through the same thing as Hyeok Soo.

327
00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.790
And like Hyeok Soo, he left this world.

328
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:53.980
After losing my father in this manner, I lived carrying a knife in my heart (harboring vengeful thoughts).

329
00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.790
If there is someone in this world who can understand you better than anyone else,

330
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.940
that would be me.

331
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.960
All the time I was bearing that knife, my wounds didn't heal.

332
00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.150
And I couldn't cut it off either.

333
00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.130
I could neither grab that knife

334
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:18.160
nor let go of it and was carrying it inside.

335
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.530
I lived with it until now.

336
00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.510
I didn't know this.

337
00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.250
I am sorry.

338
00:39:26.250 --> 00:39:28.350
Do not be, Elder.

339
00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:31.960
On the contrary, I want to thank you.

340
00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:38.620
That knife I couldn't let go of all this time,

341
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:42.340
you made me put it down.

342
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:04.810
<i>Battle for shares in Hyeong Seong Group, stock value shoots up with the whales fight. </i>

343
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.330
How much did the stock price increase?

344
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:12.390
It increased by 30% compared to yesterday. It's reaching the upper limit price every day.

345
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:13.610
What's the cause?

346
00:40:13.610 --> 00:40:17.480
The stock market sees our capital increase as a dispute over management rights.

347
00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.330
The opposing side also filed for an injunction to stop the capital increase,

348
00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:24.590
and they even made a public declaration of purchase, saying they will keep buying stocks.

349
00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:27.720
How much more money do you think we'll need to achieve the recapitalization?

350
00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.490
At this rate, at least three times more...

351
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.080
Do you know how much that amounts to? It's over a trillion won ($1B USD)!

352
00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:36.480
I don't have that kind of ready money!

353
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:40.520
This matter started because of shares, and I can't sell my shares.

354
00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.510
My apologies.

355
00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.990
How many shares is their side purchasing?

356
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:53.560
They announced that they are buying a thousand every day.

357
00:40:57.350 --> 00:41:01.600
Do we have the money to continue with the recapitalization?

358
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.330
That is the question.

359
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:10.370
From the start, he never intended to prevent the recapitalization!

360
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:14.870
It also seems like they will request an extraordinary general meeting of stockholders.

361
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.230
A stockholders' general meeting?

362
00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:23.610
That means he wants to settle things once and for all.

363
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:26.190
Call that guy here.

364
00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.570
He is currently on sick leave after his discharge—

365
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.220
What sick leave, I can't believe this!

366
00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.590
That guy has a lifeline that's as long as a rope! He even got over being stabbed!

367
00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:40.130
By the way, shouldn't you have been the ones to do what that old man did, in the first place?

368
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.170
The dogs have their stomach full,

369
00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:46.020
so the master is worn out.

370
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.940
Kwon Pil Ho finally talked.

371
00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:57.460
He told us what you spoke to him about on the phone that day.

372
00:41:58.170 --> 00:42:03.140
I said that I saw someone, what he was doing, and where&gt; Is that a crime?

373
00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.410
You can figure out whether it was a crime or not when you go to court.

374
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:10.070
But why did Kwon Pil Ho suddenly change his mind?

375
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:14.540
Well, I don't know about that. Even if I did, I cannot tell you.

376
00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.330
Come in. You went through a lot, didn't you?

377
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.590
How is it, are you feeling better?

378
00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.730
Yes.

379
00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:37.750
I went to visit you at the hospital myself. Your wife told you,  I suppose.

380
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:41.660
Yes, thank you.

381
00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.980
Let us take a seat to talk.

382
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:59.460
Seeing how I cannot easily call you a hunting dog,

383
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.940
I guess you grew up quite a lot.

384
00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.410
You think you've become something important?

385
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:13.510
Seeing that you are being careful with your words, I guess I have indeed become something important.

386
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.260
Having pushed your way this far is your talent.

387
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.830
I should value you highly for that.

388
00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:28.130
Tell me. Have you done a lot of thinking while you were lying down in the hospital?

389
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.280
I couldn't do anything else besides think.

390
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.320
We've shown our cards on both sides now,

391
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.100
so now tell me yourself. What do you plan on doing now?

392
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.930
You should step down now.

393
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.280
Step down?

394
00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.230
You're telling me to step down from my position as chairman?

395
00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:52.410
I know very well you cannot keep up with the recapitalization through to the end.

396
00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:55.820
It's not that I cannot, it's that I choose not to. Do you know why?

397
00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:00.070
Because Hyeong Seong Group was mine from the start. Why would I need to exert myself to demonstrate that?

398
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.350
As the largest shareholder, I will apply for an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders.

399
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:09.210
To change the chairman? Do you think you will win?

400
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:17.210
Even if I cannot win, I won't lose easily.

401
00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.760
Did you come all the way here to play with words?

402
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.090
I will do my best.

403
00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:32.040
And that will be my last best.

404
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:43.260
<i>Seoul ↔ Yangpyeong </i>

405
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.540
<i>He said he's staying at his mother's house. In Yangpyeong.</i>

406
00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.290
By chance...

407
00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:12.920
It's you, right?

408
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.150
The one my Jae Hyeon liked.

409
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.580
You haven't changed one bit.

410
00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.300
You are still as beautiful as when you were young.

411
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:40.200
I heard a little bit about you from Jae Hyeon.

412
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:45.910
You went through many hardships, but you stayed upright.

413
00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.660
That's not true. I became really twisted.

414
00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:52.860
I was very disobedient, too.

415
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.690
There are people like that.

416
00:45:55.690 --> 00:46:01.250
People who are so unbelievably kind. People like you.

417
00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:10.320
Even if the world seems to be moved by the wicked and violent people,

418
00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.090
the truth is, it's those kind people that are constantly pushing the world forward.

419
00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.150
That's what I think.

420
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.660
Ji Soo.

421
00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:00.920
Are you all right?

422
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:08.460
I thought I was going to die.

423
00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:11.940
Me too. I thought the surgery went wrong.

424
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.080
I thought I wouldn't see you again.

425
00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.840
The reason I came

426
00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:36.580
is that last time you asked to meet because you had something to say.

427
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:42.180
I was curious about that. I'm someone who cannot hold in her curiosity.

428
00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:44.310
I didn't ask, though.

429
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.800
You didn't?

430
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.190
I thought you did.

431
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:05.610
When I walked all night with you back in the days, I thought we would walk like that forever.

432
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.610
But it took so long for us to come back here.

433
00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.810
Will you really come back?

434
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:18.180
I'm almost there already.

435
00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.650
Thanks to someone.

436
00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.610
I probably wouldn't have been able to come on my own.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.900
Three!

468
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.910
Don't eat dinner. Let's go eat out somewhere nice.

469
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.420
I don't eat dinner late. You know that, right?

470
00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:52.560
I'll be back soon.

471
00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.530
I've made the stockholders' title closure announcement.

472
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.500
It's until June 5th, and the extraordinary stockholders meeting is twenty days later.

473
00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.290
What about the meeting with those people?

474
00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.550
It's today at three.

475
00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.660
There he is!

476
00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.460
Chairman Jang!

477
00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.260
Chairman Jang!

478
00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:49.200
Why are there so many of those things?

479
00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.990
I'm sorry.

480
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:54.870
Tell them we'll pull all our ads if they release any weird articles.

481
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:56.720
Yes, understood.

482
00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.410
Chairman Jang, just a word, please!

483
00:52:58.410 --> 00:52:59.970
Do you acknowldege the charges?

484
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:01.880
How much do you plan on revealing today?

485
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.800
Do you acknowledge the charges?

486
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.710
- What do you have to say on the matter? 
 - Do you acknowledge the charges?

487
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.260
Please look this way!

488
00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:12.690
Chairman Jang, just one word, please!

489
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.030
Hello, Chairman.

490
00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.220
I'm Prosecutor Kang Seung Won from Seoul Central District's Special 2nd Division.

491
00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:25.360
Prosecutor Kang, it's nice to meet such a famous man.

492
00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.180
I ask you to look out for me today. I have some plans for the evening.

493
00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:32.970
I'm the one who should be asking for your favor. I have a lot of things to ask you, too.

494
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.450
Today's going to be quite a busy day.

495
00:53:44.660 --> 00:53:48.860
<i> Our marriage had been over since before I meet Ji Soo.</i>

496
00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:54.840
<i> I was indifferent. You were seeing another man.</i>

497
00:53:55.780 --> 00:54:03.910
<i> When my fight with your father is over, one of us will be paying for our sins.</i>

498
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:09.860
<i> Whether that's me or your father, it will be hard for you to handle.</i>

499
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:15.130
<i> If you look after him with your most earnest devotion, do you think that when he wakes up he'll want to work things out?</i>

500
00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:20.570
<i>Do you think he'll say "I'll live as a loyal hunting dog for the rest of my days"?</i>

501
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.240
<i> There's something I promised to Sunbae. </i>

502
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:30.070
<i> That I would never disappear without a word.</i>

503
00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:33.830
<i> That we wouldn't be thrust apart, </i>

504
00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:36.670
<i>be it by fate or by someone else.</i>

505
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:43.830
<i>Looking for friends at the Sparkle Sparkle Piano House</i>

506
00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.220
Mom.

507
00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:06.320
The things I've inquired about so far have been matters for which the statute of limitations have expired or are special cases between relatives

508
00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:09.290
where we have a record of a criminal offense but cannot indict you.

509
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:11.600
However, your confirmation was in line

510
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.350
with the results from our internal review.

511
00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:17.660
You've worked hard, Prosecutor Kang. Now.

512
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.860
One moment, Chairman.

513
00:55:25.230 --> 00:55:28.330
From this moment forward, Hyeong Seong Group's Chairman, Jang San,

514
00:55:28.330 --> 00:55:31.580
Executive Director Hwang Ak Soo, and Department Head Im Yeong Geun of Management Support

515
00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.960
are under investigation for bribery, embezzlement, professional negligence,

516
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.290
violation of National Tax Collection Act, Capital Market Law... There are so many.

517
00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:44.150
The Labor Standards Act, and the Labor Union Act. You are now suspects for the aforementioned charges.

518
00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:52.940
I'm not sure if you know this, but Jae Hyeon is trying to take our company.

519
00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:55.990
Simply put, it's stealing.

520
00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:04.830
He's trying to drive out the original owner and gain power and riches.

521
00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:09.050
Don't self-righteous people like you dislike this kind of stuff?

522
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:12.430
It is exactly on the opposite side

523
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:15.830
of what you and your colleagues want.

524
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.370
<i>Will you really come back?</i>

525
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:25.920
<i>I'm already almost there.</i>

526
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:29.300
<i>Thanks to someone.</i>

527
00:56:36.090 --> 00:56:39.400
- Chairman. 
 - Yes.

528
00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:46.310
They say Vice President Han Jae Hyeon has called together the joint labor-management council representatives and labor union executives.

529
00:56:46.310 --> 00:56:48.020
That jerk.

530
00:56:48.020 --> 00:56:49.480
I wonder what he's thinking.

531
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.900
He's trying to move our shares!

532
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:55.050
All while I'm not around!

533
00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:59.090

<i>Hyeong Seong</i>

535
00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:16.500
So what is it that you want to say?

536
00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:22.300
Unless your principle is to overlook the faults of the one you love,

537
00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:26.420
please stop Jae Hyeon.

538
00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:31.400
You're the only person who can stop him.

541
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:56.280

548

<i>I thought love could work with effort, too.</i>

549

<i>I want you to be happy.</i>

<i>Will we be able to meet again?</i>
