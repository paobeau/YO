(Previously on Episode 17)
Since when has Zhao Fanzhou

16
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,980
been interested in love psychology.

17
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,460
You've got to be careful.

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,860
Do you know where Zhao Fanzhou is?

19
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,020
If you don't know, why would I know?

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,460
Fanzhou asked me not to tell.

21
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,740
Zhao Fanzhou is obviously hiding from me.

22
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,340
We've broken up.

23
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,380
Did he hurt you?

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,420
How do you know?

25
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,620
(Episode 18: Breakup gift)

26
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,700
Let's go.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,100
I'm not in the mood.

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,180
(Breakup symptom 4: Walking dead)
Pull yourself together. Don't be like that.

29
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,060
What's the fun in watching badminton game?

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,220
It's all about a flying ball.

31
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,260
I don't want to watch it.

32
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,540
I want to lie in my bed.

33
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,260
No way.

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,940
Xie Yixing told me

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,180
he'd tear off his shirt

36
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,900
if he wins the game.

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,500
Do you hear that? Tear off his shirt!

38
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,620
What's the big deal?

39
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,460
I'm leaving.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,580
Lechery is not my thing.

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,580
Let's go! Let's go!

42

Xie Yixing!

Xie Yixing!

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
Xie Yixing is waving hands to the audience.

46
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,420
He looks pretty confident.

47
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,340
Come on! Cheer up!

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,620
Look!

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,340
The audience is also very passionate.

50
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,740
Let's look forward to the game!

51
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,500
OK, the game starts now.

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,620
Xie Yixing is cooperating well
with his teammate.

53
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,380
Bravo, Xie Yixing!

54
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
Nice smash!

55
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,180
Both sides are playing patiently,

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:23,540
-the lead goes saw between them.
-Come on, Xie Yixing!

57
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,260
Xie Yixing has got in the groove
shortly after the game started.

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,260
The game is in the clutch.

It's 20-19 now.

Xie Yixing has reached the match point.

61
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,980
Excellent!

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,900
Xie Yixing smashed the ball!

63
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,980
The game is over.

64
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,900
Congratulations, Team Renzhou.
Congratulations, Xie Yixing!

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,740
Look! Xie Yixing is going
to tear off his shirt!

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,180
He got stuck.

67
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:29,580
Come on, Xie Yixing!

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,460
Lu,

69
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,900
your badminton star is so funny!

70
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
You can't be like this anymore!

71
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,340
Change your attitude.

72
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,100
Change your belief.

73
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,940
Be more active.

74
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,860
Make achievements.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,340
Be active about everything!

76

writers can learn a lot

80
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,500
from flash fiction.

81
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,340
Besides Zhou Xiao,

82
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,140
does anyone of you

83
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
know

84
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,220
the pursuit

85
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,180
of writing novels?

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,420
I do!

87
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:30,980
Oh, my!

88
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,740
It freaked me out.

89
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,140
You again?

90
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,740
It's shortness, novelty,
compactness and originality.

91
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,660
It refers to short story,

92
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,460

original ending.

95
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,260
Calm down. Sit back.

96
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,060
Yes, Sir!

97
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,100
She's right.

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:47,820
She's right.

99
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,220
But...

100
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,100
Zhou Xiao,

101
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,460
you've answered five, six questions in a row.

102
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,860
It's more than the total number
of last month.

103
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,500
The rest of you

104
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,980
are welcomed to answer the questions.

105
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,660
It's not

106
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,700
a private lesson.

107
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,780
Well, another question.

108
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,020
Who knows...

109
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,900
I do!

110
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,380
Sir, I do!

111
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,380
Sit back. Sit back.

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,780
Sit back.

113
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,940
I have another question.

114
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,620
I've run out of questions.

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,340
On an unrelated note,

116
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,700
before the vacation,

117
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,740
there is this "Cup of Seeking Truth"
Novel Contest

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,580
in our Department.

119
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,020
You are welcomed

120
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,540
to send your complete work to me.

121
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,220
The deadline is next Friday.

122
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,660
Sir,

123
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,500
I...

124
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,500
I'm in.

125
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,700
Zhou Xiao, please calm down.

126
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,820
Sir, I mean it.

127
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,700
I've posted my serial on the internet.

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,420
It's very popular.

129
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,380
I can make about three yuan a day.

130
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,940
I use the money to buy ice pops

131
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,140
for my roommates every day.

132
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,820
You're a genius.

133
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,180
How about this?

134
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,180
Arrange your ice cream,

135
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:22,820
I mean,

136
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,580
your script

137
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,220
and send it to my office.

138
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,780
Before that,

139
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,860
I have something to discuss with you.

140
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,300
It's about the character arc.

141
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,540
My characters

142
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,460
have desires,

143
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,940
contradictions in humanity,

144
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,740
inside and outside pressures.

145
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,900
They even have choices to make.

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,820
So, I believe

147
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,540
I've created character arc.

148
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,220
However,

149
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:45,900
I think...

150
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,460
That's it for today.

151
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,180
Sir!

152
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,180
Sir, I haven't finished yet.

153
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,460
Wow!

154
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,060
Zhou Xiao,

155
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,220
you're awesome!

156
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,820
You even made King Shu of Overtime

157
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,460
drop his class like that.

158
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,700
See?

159
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,900
Is she gonna compete
for the scholarship against me?

160
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,500
Perhaps.

161
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,380
The world is full of hot guys.

162
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,660
Zhao Fanzhou means nothing to me.

163
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:23,820
Ling.

164
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,020
Ah?

165
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
Send me some pictures of hot guys, please.

166
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:28,900
Well.

167
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,580
I thought you were writing a novel

168
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,540
for the contest.

169
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,940
Why do you keep looking at hot guys?

170
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,100
I've finished my novel.

171
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,300
So soon?

172
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,980
I've written out all of my characters.

173
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,340
What?

174
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,420
Come on.

175
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:40,620
Just

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,940
share with me

177
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,900
all your collection

178
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,660
of hot guys.

179
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,460
Why should I?

180
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,900
I spend a whole year on collecting them.

181
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,020
I'm keeping it to myself.

182
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,140
But,

183
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,700
I broke up with my boyfriend.

184
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,660
Alright, lady.

185
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,540
I'll send the photos to you right now.

186
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,140
Hurry up!

187
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,500
Wei.

188
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,780
Eh?

189
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,460
Have you written your review

190
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,700
on the conclusion of the course
of ideological and moral education class?

191
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,580
Yes.

192
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,900
Great. Write one for me.

193
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,540
Why should I?

194
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:26,820
I broke up with my boyfriend.

195
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,500
Alright, alright.

196
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,620
I'll do it for you.

197
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,940
You...

198
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,700
Why are you staring at me?

199
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,340
I want you to spray your perfume

200
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,540
in my wardrobe.

201
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,100
Nope.

202
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,940
I'm not gonna do it.

203
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,620
It's very expensive.

204
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,540
Very expensive?

205
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:58,980
Yes.

206
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,060
OK.

207
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,700
I...

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,460
I broke up with my boyfriend

209
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,260
so I want to smell something good.

210
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,140
But I don't want to push in.

211
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,900
I'll work it out on my own.

212
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,860
Is that OK for you?

213
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,460
I also want to use your Mihoo facial mask

214
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,260
which is super moisturizing.

215
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,180
You're way out of the...

216
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,980
OK. OK.

217
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,580
(Mihoo)

218
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,220
I...

219
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,340
I suddenly feel like eating an orange.

220
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,380
Can you cut one for me?

221
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,940
I mean, peel one for me.

222
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,780
Sure.

223
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,180
Lu.

224
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,620
Wei.

225
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:24,900
It's...

226
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:27,980
Who is this?

227
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,140
Hey, hey, hey.

228
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,060
What's up?

229
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,860
Come to the cafe.

230
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,540
I have a great gift for you.

231
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:42,420
Nope.

232
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,100
What great gift can I expect from you?

233
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,620
Every time I ask you to order meal for me,

234
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,260
you'd buy me cheap snacks.

235
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,500
Garage kit of Conan, limited edition.

236
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:52,700
It's your decision to make.

237
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,260
Amazing.

238
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,340
You're so amazing!

239
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,380
I'm coming down right now.

240
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,580
Wait for me.

241
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,020
This is ridiculous.

242
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,060
This is ridiculous.

243
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,940
Slow down.

244
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,300
Take care.

245
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,740
Why do you bring me here?

246
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,100
Let go of me.

247
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,140
We haven't broken up.

248
00:12:59,380 --> 00:12:59,780
Zhou Xiao.

249
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,140
Shut up.

250
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,260
You haven't...

251
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,700
Shut up!

252
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,140
What are you doing?

253
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,300
I've tried to contact you every day.

254
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:18,940
Take it.

255
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,660
Just take it.

256
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,460
Isn't this your phone number?

257
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,740
Why did you call him?

258
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,940
How come you remember my phone number?

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,620
I called you so many times.

260
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,700
It's only natural that I remember it.

261
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,900
Check the messages.

262
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,060
Why should I?

263
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
(Why didn't you answer the phone?
My mom got injured.)

264
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,300
(Didn't Yixing tell you about that?)

265
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,100
It can't be true.

266
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,060
I didn't get anything on my phone.

267
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,380
I mean it.

268
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,580
I'm an expert.

269
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,300
Don't look down upon me.

270
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,860
Leave it to me.

271
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,180
Zhou Xiao,

272
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,500
you blocked him.

273
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:40,780
Ah?

274
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,060
Why would I block him?

275
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,260
How should I know?

276
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:00,620
Perhaps

277
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,980
I'm not familiar

278
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,460
with this phone.

279
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,660
I pressed the wrong button.

280
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,900
Now, it's your turn to explain it.

281
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,220
Explain what?

282
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,740
Why didn't you call me?

283
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,180
I did.

284
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,780
I did like five times.

285
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,260
I called you at least 50 times
every single day.

286
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,260
Well.

287
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:22,860
Number

288
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,420
doesn't matter.

289
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,620
Then what matters?

290
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,940
You.

291
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,300
You smiled.

292
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:36,740
No, I didn't.

293
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,460
Yes, you did.

294
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,660
No, I didn't.

295
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,500
Yes, you did.

296
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,340
No, I didn't.

297
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:41,740
Yes, you did.

298
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,900
No, I didn't.

299
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,420
Wait a moment.

300
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:44,420
Hey,

301
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,180
it's a public place.

302
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,540
Don't you think it's a little disgusting

303
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,740
to show your affection like that?

304
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,780
I'm leaving.

305
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:53,860
Hey, wait a moment.

306
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,580
Pay the bill first.

307
00:15:59,500 --> 00:15:59,940
Zhou Xiao,

308
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,340
don't you think you've gone too far?

309
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,140
Nope.

310
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,700
Thank you for what you did.

311
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,740
No big deal.

312
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,380
You two have a good time.

313
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,100
Bye!

314
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:15,900
Bye!

315
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,900
Why did you thank him?

316
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:23,980
Nothing.

317
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,220
I don't think so.

318
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:26,980
Tell me.

319
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,620
Why did you thank him?

320
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,820
I thanked him for clearing my name.

321
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,260
Otherwise,

322
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,500
I wouldn't know someone has blocked me.

323
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,300
Oh!

324
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,380
But

325
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,460
why were you two waiting for me together?

326
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,700
I ran into him.

327
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,220
Then I asked him

328
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:50,940
to find an excuse to ask you out.

329
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,580
Oh, I see.

330
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,180
So,

331
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,340
there is no limited edition
of Conan garage kit?

332
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,980
I was so excited on my way here.

333
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
I'm in my slippers, for god's sake.

334
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,460
I just know it.

335
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,900
Cai Yasi would never be so generous.

336
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,580
How is Zhou Xiao?

337
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,300
She is fine.

338
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,420
They why are you here?

339
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,540
And

340
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,700
how do you know I'm here?

341
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,540
There's not a single person I can't locate.

342
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,260
It's lunch time.

343
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,420
Buy me lunch.

344
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,420
Pork stewed with potato noodles.

345
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,580
Stewed pork ribs.

346
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,100
Chicken stewed with mushrooms.

347
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,060
Fried pork.

348
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,340
Crispy pork.

349
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,740
And, fried eggplants,
potatoes and green chili.

350
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,300
Sir, I'm afraid it's too much for two people.

351
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,820
That's it.

352
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,380
Don't worry.

353
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,700
This guy is very rich.

354
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,980
Extravagance

355
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,020
is his hallmark.

356
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,060
Understood.

357
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,260
Do you have any money with you?

358
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,420
Just so you know,
I don't have any cash on me.

359
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,460
What do you want from me?

360
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,900
I think

361
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,340
we need talk it out face to face.

362
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,500
I like Zhou Xiao.

363
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,740
I just can't stand you
treating her like that.

364
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,180
You can tell her face to face.

365
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,380
Don't worry about her emotions.

366
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,260
I'll comfort her.

367
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,180
She likes crying.

368
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,740
But she's also forgetful.

369
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,740
She is way tougher

370
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,620
than you think.

371
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:14,980
Why are you trying to say here?

372
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,740
Zhou Xiao said she couldn't get in touch you,

373
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,540
and that you're trying to break up
with her using cold violence.

374
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,020
Who told you we broke up?

375
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,260
Then why do you disappear
and disconnect from her?

376
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,020
I think I'm the one who couldn't
get in touch with her.

377
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,020
I never thought you're like this.

378
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,860
You even let her to take the blame for this.

379
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,380
Check it out yourself.

380
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,900
(Recents)

381
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,460
There must be

382
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,980
some misunderstanding here.

383
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,700
As an outsider,

384
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,940
I guess I shouldn't intervene too much.

385
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,060
It was just a joke.

386
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,380
I didn't say anything.

387
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,860
Now, we have to deal with

388
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,300
something even more important.

389
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,500
What is it?

390
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,500
We ordered so many dishes.

391
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,100
Hope we can finish them.

392
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,780
Where are you going?

393
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm calling my mom

394
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,820
and then getting back to the campus
to find Zhou Xiao.

395
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,380
No rush, no rush.

396
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,340
Let's have lunch first.

397
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,580
Give Zhou Xiao some time to think.

398
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,860
It's not a big deal.

399
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:02,260
Sir,

400
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,180
here is the dish of crispy pork.

401
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,780
Well...

402
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,660
Well...

403
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,420
Can I cancel the order

404
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,340
of the rest dishes?

405
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,380
I'll check it for you.

406
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,660
Thank you so much.

407
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,300
It's OK.

408
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:23,700
Let's go.

409
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,540
The dishes haven't been served yet.

410
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,700
You're no fun.

411
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,100
What does Zhou Xiao see in you?

412
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,300
As you said,

413
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,620
you shouldn't be intervening too much.

414
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
If you don't treat her well,

415
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,700
I'll intervene even more.

416
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,220
Remember,

417
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm always waiting for a chance.

418
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,140
Let me tell you,

419
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,540
you don't stand a chance.

420
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:56,780
That's good.

421
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,900
Don't forget to pay the bill, dude.

422
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,500
Why do you bring me here?

423
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,700
Buy you a new cell phone.

424
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,140
No, no.

425
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,180
My cell phone will be fixed in a couple days.

426
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,140
Why are you buying me a new one?

427
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,700
Does your money burn a hole in your pocket?

428
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,660
So, you've already decided

429
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,420
that I'm gonna pay for it?

430
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,860
I thought...

431
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,940
Well, I don't have the money
to pay for it, after all.

432
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:27,780
Let's go.

433
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,340
Let's go.

434
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,020
I'll pay for it.

435
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,180
Nope.

436
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,500
I mean it.

437
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,380
I'm getting back to hospital tomorrow.

438
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,060
I don't want to lose touch with you.

439
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,660
I've already removed you

440
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,900
from the blacklist.

441
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,380
OK, OK.

442
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,900
We'll buy it.

443
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,860
Excuse me,

444
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,860
what can I do for you?

445
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,020
I want the latest one in your shop.

446
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,260
Since we're gonna buy it,

447
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,380
why don't we buy a good one?

448
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,460
Fine.

449
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,860
I don't want the latest one.

450
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,740
I want

451
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,540
the most expensive one.

452
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,220
OK.

453
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,340
Miss,

454
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,740
this is the most expensive,

455
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,980
the most well-equipped cellphone in our shop.

456
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,260
It costs 6188 yuan.

457
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,700
What did you say?

458
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,260
6188 yuan.

459
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,940
I... I was kidding.

460
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,820
Well. I'll take

461
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,740
the cheapest one.

462
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,540
Ah.

463
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,460
Well,

464
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,540
what's your budget?

465
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,220
Within 1000 yuan...

466
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
We'll take it.

467
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,100
I'll use WeChat-pay.

468
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,020
OK.

469
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,580
Please wait a minute.
I'll bring you a new one.

470
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,660
Are you born with a silver spoon

471
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,020
or are you a potential business tycoon?

472
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,020
Am I

473
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,220
the lucky one?

474
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:01,020
See?

475
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
It works quite smoothly.

476
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,500
What did you just say?

477
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,220
You like taking pictures so much.

478
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,100
Why didn't you choose the latest cell phone?

479
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,340
It has better performance in photographing.

480
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,700
I'm fine with using
the same cell phone as yours.

481
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,180
I'm not a gold digger.

482
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,100
Is your family so rich

483
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,220
that you have problem spending it?

484
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,100
Ah!

485
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,220
Do you use

486
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,300
black cards?

487
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,980
Is there a Rolls-Royce stretch limousine

488
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,780
in your garage?

489
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,580
When you come back home,

490
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,620
is there a butler waiting
at the front door asking

491
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,420
"Master,

492
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,300
how is your day?

493
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,260
Did anyone make you unhappy?

494
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,180
If so, please let me know,

495
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,380
I'll let his family go bankrupt."

496
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,420
Do you want to check it out?

497
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,540
Nope.

498
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,740
Let me keep a little imagination.

499
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,300
Perhaps I'll write a novel
about a bossy president.

500
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,940
What's more,

501
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,220
if I find out you're even poorer than I am,

502
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,060
you may blame me for being snobbish

503
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,380
when we break up one day.

504
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,780
It will bother me.

505
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,860
Why do you always think
we're gonna break up one day?

506
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,540
I didn't mean it.

507
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:09,860
I just think

508
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,820
no one can tell the future.

509
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,500
So, am I not allowed to bring it up?

510
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,460
No, you're not.

511
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,820
Hum.

512
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,220
OK.

513
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,060
I see.

514
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,500
What?

515
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,900
I shouldn't bring up the breakup thing.

516
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,100
Because it's a jinx.

517
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,100
It's because we won't break up.

518
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,300
Hum.

519
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,140
We won't break up.

520
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,500
Why are you laughing?

521
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,940
Nothing.

522
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,740
It's just

523
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,100
I suddenly find you're cute.

524
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,780
Why are you silent?

525
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,340
You're blushing.

526
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,500
You really are.

527
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,540
No, I'm not.

528
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,860
Yes, you're.

529
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,980
Now, who is blushing?

530
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,060
You cheated!

531
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,900
I have prepared a gift for you.

532
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,620
Now, I'm not gonna give it to you.

533
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,620
When did you buy the gift?

534
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,300
When you were in the washroom
in the shopping mall.

535
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,380
I need to go to the washroom.

536
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,940
Wait for a moment.

537
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:15,380
OK.

538
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:15,980
I'll be waiting for you.

539
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,380
Would you hold this for me?

540
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:18,220
Ah!

541
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,340
Why don't you ask me what the gift is?

542
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,980
You're not giving it to me.

543
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,060
Why bother?

544
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,900
You could still ask about it,

545
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,700
even though I'm not giving it to you.

546
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,980
I won't ask.

547
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,700
Hey, how come

548
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,980
you don't have any curiosity at all?

549
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,940
Then, what is the gift?

550
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,860
Couples phone shells.

551
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:01,500
Do you want it?

552
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,220
No way.

553
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,780
What should I do

554
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,700
to make you change your mind?

555
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,260
Run ten circles

556
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,300
around the playground.

557
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:11,980
Hey!

558
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:12,860
I'm just kidding.

559
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,660
Here you are.

560
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,100
It's for me?

561
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,180
Yep.

562
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:21,660
I like blue.

563
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,460
I'll have the blue one.

564
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,460
I don't want it.

565
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,380
Hey!

566
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:24,620
Wait!

567
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,740
Hey!

568
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,780
What's the problem with the pink one?

569
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,020
We live in a modern society.

570
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,620
There is no rule that says blue is for boys

571
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,940
and pink is for girls.

572
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,620
You have to break the gender barriers.

573
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,140
Hey!

574
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:40,500
Hey!

575
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,340
(Mom)

576
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,660
Hello, mom.

577
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:12,500
What's up?

578
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,380
Fanzhou,

579
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,260
get back home soon.

580
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,620
Get back home soon.

581
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,020
I thought you're in the hospital.

582
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,500
Why are you at home?

583
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,900
They wanted me
to have psychiatric evaluation.

584
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,100
I'm not a psycho. I'm not gonna do it.

585
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I asked your dad

586
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,900
to bring me home.

587
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,900
But once we got home,
he said he needed to go to work.

588
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,700
He's leaving me alone at home.

589
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,700
Can you get back home soon?

590
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,500
Get back home soon.

591
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,100
Get back home soon.

592
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,020
Get back home soon.

593
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:38,660
OK.

594
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,580
I see.

595
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,780
I'll be back soon.

596
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,620
What's up?

597
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,540
How is your mom?

598
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,540
It's OK.

599
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,060
She checked out on her own.

600
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,660
I need to get back home now.

601
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,100
OK.

602
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,020
Go home now.

603
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,300
I'll walk you back to your dorm.

604
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,260
No, no. I can do it on my own.

605
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,020
Go home now.

606
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,740
Should I offer

607
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,140
to visit your mom?

608
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,260
Perhaps it's better this way.

609
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,380
Do you want to visit her?

610
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,700
Actually, I'm very nervous.

611
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:08,740
But I'll get over it.

612
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,180
Maybe next time.

613
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,820
The doctor said she is unstable

614
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,180
and needs some quiet time.

615
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:20,900
Alright.

616
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,460
See you.

617
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,460
Fanzhou, cheer up!

618
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:52,460
Dad,

619
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,660
mom.

620
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:54,980
You're home.

621
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,380
Fanzhou.

622
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:57,540
Mom,

623
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:58,980
are you alright?

624
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,580
I'm fine.

625
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,460
I've been talking to Yichun.

626
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:05,940
Yichun,

627
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,180
what brings you here?

628
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,180
Well,

629
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,780
I called Mrs. Zhao to ask if she's OK.

630
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,420
She told me she had checked out.

631
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,380
I'm here to visit her.

632
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,100
Yichun is very considerate.

633
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,780
We've been talking for a while.

634
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,220
It makes me feel less painful.

635
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,340
Thank you, Yichun.

636
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,820
It's alright.

637
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,380
Mom,

638
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,460
did the doctor write you prescriptions?

639
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,940
Of course.

640
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,300
I asked the doctor

641
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,740
to write a prescription for my injury.

642
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,860
You can change the dressing for me.

643
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,900
It will save me from going to the hospital.

644
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,300
I don't like the smell there.

645
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:43,580
Mom,

646
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,540
where did you put the medicines?

647
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,660
In my room.

648
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,540
OK.

649
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,580
He always looks like that.

650
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Don't take it personally.

651
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,780
It's alright.

652
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,380
Mom, you can have your medicine.

653
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,820
Fanzhou, are you going
to the campus tomorrow?

654
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,500
If so,

655
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,220
I could go with you.

656
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,540
I've asked for leave.

657
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,460
I'm taking care of my mom at home tomorrow.

658
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,020
You don't need to do anything during the day.

659
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,540
You can change my dressing

660
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,380
after school.

661
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,300
Tomorrow,

662
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,220
you two go to the campus

663
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,740
together.

664
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:20,580
OK.

665
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,340
You two grew up together.

666
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,380
You must take care of each other

667
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,860
in the campus.

668
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:26,740
Mrs. Zhao,

669
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,260
Fanzhou takes care of me a lot in the campus.

670
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,860
Does he often buy you dinner?

671
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,100
No.

672
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,380
Why?

673
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,940
I have a girlfriend.

674
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,580
I need to have dinner with my girlfriend.

675
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,540
You two talk.

676
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,020
A girlfriend?

677
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,460
Mrs. Zhao,

678
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,100
it's getting late.

679
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,620
I've got to go

680
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,580
now.

681
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,620
Please stay for dinner.

682
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,740
Don't go.

683
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,940
Thanks, but I've got something to do.

684
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,020
I'll visit you some other day.

685
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,100
Thanks.

686
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,220
Take good care of yourself.

687
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,180
See you.

688
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:05,700
See you.

689
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,300
You take care.

690
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,100
A girlfriend?

691
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:21,940
Fanzhou,

692
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,900
when did it start?

693
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,780
This semester.

694
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,740
Why didn't you tell me about it?

695
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,500
Why are you like your dad

696
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,780
who never tells me about anything?

697
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:40,460
Mom,

698
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,180
let me change your dressing.

699
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,540
No, no.

700
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,540
Do you think it's annoying

701
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,700
for me

702
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,620
to ask you about this?

703
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,220
Her name is Zhou Xiao.

704
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,460
She majors in Chinese.

705
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,220
She has big eyes,

706
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,900
a round face,

707
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,980
cute smile.

708
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,820
She eats a lot.

709
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,500
But,

710
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,300
she hates carrots.

711
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,820
She is like you.

712
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,900
You hate carrots, too.

713
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,380
When you have meals,

714
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,620
who would eat carrots in the dish?

715
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,980
It's me.

716
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,220
Love is not always easy.

717
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:30,860
Do you have a picture of her?

718
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,020
Can I see it?

719
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,100
OK.

720
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:37,980
This phone shell...

721
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,380
It's a gift from her.

722
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,380
That's good.

723
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,340
Mom.

724
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,660
She has short hair.

725
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,180
Yes.

726
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,540
She looks nice.

727
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,460
One more thing.

728
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:00,940
How is her temper?

729
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,740
Hope she is not

730
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,060
as annoying as me.

731
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:06,860
She is good-tempered.

732
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,340
Mom.

733
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,220
That's good to hear.

734
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,100
When will you

735
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,620
bring her to me?

736
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,540
She would have come today.

737
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
But the doctor said

738
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,660
you needed some quiet time.

739
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,260
That's right.

740
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,460
She might get frightened

741
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,020
by what I look like right now.

742
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,100
Mom,

743
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,620
let me change your dressing.

744
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,620
What a horrible ending.

745
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,060
It's bullshit.

746
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:45,900
Come in.

747
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:48,980
Sir.

748
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,300
Come in.

749
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,780
I'm looking for you.

750
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,020
The first half of your novel is good.

751
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,620
But what happened

752
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,580
to the ending?

753
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,340
How come the bloodthirsty medical examiner

754
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,340
was killed by his crush

755
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,340
with a scalpel

756
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,140
while the rest were killed

757
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,460
by poisonous gas?

758
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,580
Isn't it ridiculous?

759
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,740
Are you kidding me?

760
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,100
Sir,

761
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,020
I'm here to talk about this with you.

762
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
I want to quit.

763
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,220
Why?

764
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,940
I haven't finished this story yet.

765
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,700
I don't want to rush it for the contest.

766
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:20,660
There you go.

767
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,780
That's the kind of attitude we look for
when it comes to writing.

768
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,340
We need to be precise,

769
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,900
scrutinous,

770
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,580
prudent.

771
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,300
Am I right?

772
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,060
Alright.

773
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:28,740
Get back and work on it.

774
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,780
Bring it to me when you've finished.

775
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:30,740
Ah?

776
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,300
Are you rushing me?

777
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,260
I'm a gatekeeper for your novel.

778
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,020
Sure.

779
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,860
Sure.

780
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,660
See you.

781
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:39,420
Thank you, Sir!

782
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:54,700
Let me tell you,

783
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,700
Mr. Shu has become
a fan of my work now.

784
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,220
I'm literally a genius

785
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,220
in the writing circle of web novels.

786
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm not going to listen to your boasting.

787
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,460
When you come back,

788
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,180
bring us dinner.

789
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,020
I want rice noodle roll of No.2 cafeteria,

790
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,860
Lu wants Wet Fried Beef Rice
of No.1 cafeteria,

791
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,420
Luo Wei wants rice served with roast goose.

792
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,140
Hey!

793
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,100
Can you at least show me some respect?

794
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,380
Professor,

795
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,420
here is my exam paper.

796
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,220
You handle it in so soon.

797
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:51,460
It's a pressure for the rest of the students.

798
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,940
Take it back and give it a check.

799
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,100
I already did.

800
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,420
Thank you, Professor!

801
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,340
I've finished the exam.

802
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,300
How about you?

803
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,100
(Final exam for the Chinese Major of the 2rd
semester of 2017 - 2018 academic year)

804
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,420
You have thirty minutes

805
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,820
before the exam is over.

806
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,300
Seize the time.

807
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,820
Don't look at me.
The answers aren't written on my face.

808
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,100
Sir,

809
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,020
here is my exam paper.

810
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,500
It seems you can't wait
to start your vacation.

811
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,580
Well,

812
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
I guess I'm not that eager.

813
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,540
May I know

814
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,340
why you haven't finished your exam paper?

815
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,660
I was in a hurry.

816
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,860
I didn't notice the back of the paper.

817
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,540
I'm sorry, Sir!

818
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,500
Why are you saying sorry to me?

819
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,780
You should say it to yourself!

820
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,380
Hurry up. You have only thirty minutes.

821
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,340
Why bother saying sorry?

822
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,100
Some of you

823
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,900
are absent-minded.

824
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,260
It's the last final exam.

825
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,260
Don't take it lightly.

826
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,380
It's OK to be in a relationship,

827
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,540
but one must be serious about the exam.

828
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,180
Time is up!

829
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,260
Sir,

830
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,980
this time, I've really finished it.

831
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,980
Wait a moment.

832
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,100
I need to talk to you.

833
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,780
OK.

834
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,260
You're

835
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,020
a careless person.

836
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:34,460
(-I'm waiting for you outside.
-OK, I'll be there soon.)

837
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,500
Sir, what is it about me?

838
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,740
Here is the thing.

839
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,900
Next month,

840
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,780
there's a one-week writing
summer camp in Beijing

841
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,620
which is organized by

842
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,900
the Writers Association of the city.

843
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,060
Our Department has one quota.

844
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,540
Do you have someone

845
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,540
to put forward?

846
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,140
I have no idea.

847
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,380
You can recommend
whoever you think is appropriate.

848
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,420
I have this student who writes a novel.

849
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,020
The first part is really good.

850
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,180
It's called

851
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,460
the Bloodthirsty Two-faced Medical Examiner.

852
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,060
Thank you, Sir! I'd love to!

853
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,140
I'll recommend you.

854
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,140
But you have to promise

855
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,820
that you'll finish the novel

856
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,780
before you leave the campus.

857
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,540
I'm waiting for it.

858
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,420
Sure. Sure.

859
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,500
I owe you big time.

860
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,660
Perhaps I'm not able to pay you back.

861
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,140
Actually, I'm thinking
of another student in the class

862
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:28,180
who is also very competent.

863
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,020
Sir,

864
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,500
I was just kidding.

865
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,740
I will definitely pay you back.

866
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,260
I will finish the novel soon.

867
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,900
Go to your boyfriend, then.

868
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,460
You're excused.

869
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:41,660
Yes, Sir!

870
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,180
Zhao Fanzhou.

871
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,700
Here I come!

872
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,460
Slowly. Slowly.

873
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,580
You must have waited for a while.

874
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:53,820
Well, you tell me.

875
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,700
I have some big news to announce.

876
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,020
What news?

877
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,740
You're looking at

878
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,420
the rising star

879
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,900
of the writing circle,

880
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,220
the future leader of the literary world

881
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,020
who is about to rise to the top,

882
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,140
the most promising candidate

883
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,940
for Nobel Prize in Literature.

884
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,620
Did the exam hurt your brain?

885
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,300
Hum.

886
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,820
I'm dispatched to Beijing

887
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,780
by the Department of Chinese

888
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,060
for the writing summer campus
organized by the Writers Association.

889
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,540
When is it?

890
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:19,340
For how long?

891
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,220
Next month.

892
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,020
For a week.

893
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,740
I'll go with you.

894
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,980
Nope.

895
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm an independent girl.

896
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,100
They all go there on their own.

897
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,060
Are all the other kids going there

898
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,620
on their own?

899
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,380
Yes.

900
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:31,860
So, don't follow me everywhere.

901
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,300
I need some personal space.

902
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,180
Did I follow you everywhere?

903
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,340
What's your plan for summer vacation?

904
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,620
I'll stay at the campus
and conduct experiments.

905
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,020
So boring.

906
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,580
How about you?

907
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,260
I can't think of anything other than go home.

908
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,540
That's why I'm asking you.

909
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,260
How about I go home with you?

910
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,060
No, no.

911
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,500
You take it the wrong way.
I don't mean it like that.

912
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:58,780
Then, what do you mean?

913
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,500
I mean you're not going
to my place that easy.

914
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,060
Lazy Ling,

915
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,620
Lu,

916
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,900
I'm leaving.

917
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,100
See you next semester.

918
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,060
Bye.

919
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,300
See you next semester.

920
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,100
Bye.

921
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,900
Take care.

922
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,100
OK.

923
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,140
Let us know when you get home.

924
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:37,780
OK.

925
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:37,980
Let's go.

926
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,180
Have a nice trip.

927
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,940
Every time the exam is over,

928
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,020
Wei would pick up and leave for hometown.

929
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,060
Perhaps she is missing her grandpa.

930
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,700
She is a sweet girl.

931
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,300
Why are you still up there?

932
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,100
Are you waiting for your boyfriend
to pack things for you?

933
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:01,660
I wait for him?

934
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,700
Bullshit.

935
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,340
He'd stay and conduct experiments
for his tutor

936
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
instead of accompanying me home.

937
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,340
I'm pissed off.

938
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,460
Oops.

939
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,620
My apology.

940
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,020
Lu.

941
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,100
You're back.

942
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,420
Yes.

943
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,500
Lu,

944
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,540
are you going back home this early?

945
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,660
Nope.

946
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,900
We're having a sketching

947
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,940
after the final exam.

948
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,300
Where are you going for the sketching?

949
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,980
We're going

950
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,220
to Haicheng.

951
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,820
Haicheng?

952
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:31,500
It's on the way

953
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
to my and Ling's hometown.

954
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,460
Really?

955
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:33,820
Yes.

956
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,060
How about

957
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:37,380
we go together?

958
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,300
We have some fun at the sketching spot.

959
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,140
After that, we get back home together.

960
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,180
Deal.

961
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,820
(Next Episode)

962
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,620
I like you.

963
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,500
Could you like me back?

964
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,380
Zhou Xiao!

965
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:05,980
We're so dead.

966
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,700
Dad.

967
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,540
