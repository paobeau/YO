What are you saying, you bastard?

24
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.590

Hey! Come back here!

Gosh, really...

31

How dare you kiss me without permission?

32
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.180
A kiss that I haven't done in 10 years...

33
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.390
10 years. 10 years!

34
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.600
Why does it not feel like 10 years though?

Okay, let's go.

55
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.410
- Are you going to work? 
 - Yeah.

56
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.980
Hey, what are you doing this weekend? You should help me with Doha's first birthday party.

57
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.870
I'm going to take pictures only and not throw a party. Should I use a baby studio?

58
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.970
If there's a good place, introduce me.

59

Okay.

60
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.760
We should go shopping and eat delicious food.

61
00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.130
- Shall we give Doha to Aunt for a bit and go watch a movie? 
 - Yeah.

62
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.420
Really? It's for real, right?

63
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:37.710
What should we watch? I'm thinking a romantic one is good. A sweet movie.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.130
Yeah.

65
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.300
- You're not listening to me, right? 
 - Yeah.

66
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.200
- Hey! 
 - You scared me!

67
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.910
What's wrong now?

68
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.070
You said it wasn't a man making you upset.

69
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.890
Being single-minded and only liking one man. Don't do that.

70
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:56.260
Look beside you and select the man who has everything.

71
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.930
Here.

72
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:02.590
You also have a lot of sins in your life.

73
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.570
What?

74
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.130
What sins do I have?

75
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.590
I'm reborn. I don't let Doha go hungry anymore.

76
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.780
Right, Doha?

77
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.810
Do you not have square-shaped kimbap here?

78
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:44.290
Do you want to eat this?

79
00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.840
Senior, are you not going to eat?

80
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.550
What's the point of eating?

81
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:07.120
Why are you like this again? We need to get rid of our hangovers.

82
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.840
Hey, let's go eat.

83
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.170
What should we eat? Let's get soup.

84
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.450
You're really not eating?

85
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.290
I should probably eat to survive.

86
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.140
It's refreshing.

87
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.370
Do you... become the chief editor now?

88
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.910
What do you think, Chief Editor Jang?

89
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.180
He wouldn't sue me after all this time, surely...

90
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:43.700
What? Something tastes nutty? What does?

91

95

<i>Reporter Yoon, it's not uncommon to hear about a woman getting arrested for sexual harassment.</i>

96
00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.280
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

97
00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.330
<i>This woman pleaded that she thought men would</i>

99
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.830
<i>I was surprised by this wrongful mindset.</i>

100
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.400
A life full of sins.

101
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.890
Right, right.

102
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.310
- Hello! 
 - Welcome!

103
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.860
- The seats... 
 - We can eat later.

104
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.290
I already ate everything. There's a spot here.

105
00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:36.300
You didn't eat at all.

106
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.320
<i>You should pay!</i>

107
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.980
- I don't have my wallet. 
 - I'll eat this.

108
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.400
I didn't bring my wallet.

109
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:45.750
Another bowl, please!

110
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.160
Ugh, well, ugh.

111
00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.810
I must be crazy.

112
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.270
Deputy Editor, yesterday... I...

113
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.770
Why did you do that to me?

114
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.820
Because I heard you and Reporter Park talking about you liking me in the reference room.

115
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.590
I... I caused you to misunderstand, didn't I?

116
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.950
I'm sorry. I was talking about your sperm.

117
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.870
No, I'm sorry. The alcohol...

118
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.930
It's okay. Who am I to criticize?

119
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.000
I didn't know my sins. I should die...

120
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.170
Thank you, Deputy Editor!

I can call you "older brothers," right?

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:28.960
- No. 
 - I don't like it.

You said it had to do with Hari. What is it?

134
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.670
To be honest, I made a huge mistake with Deputy Editor.

135
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.650
What mistake?

136
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.970
I... think I confessed wrong.

137
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.340
What confession?

138
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.590
Oh, you caused an accident?

139
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.360
You borrowed money but can't pay it back?

140
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.880
I think I like Deputy Editor.

141
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.590
I think I like Deputy Editor.

142
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.960
Hey, young friend, what's with the "I think?"

143
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.720
The term "like" is a little too light.

144
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.550
The term "admire" is too heavy...

145
00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.750
I think it's in the middle somewhere?

146
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:25.380
But why did you confess?

147
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.580
That'll get you a scolding from Hari.

148
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.230
I did get scolded while drunk.

149
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.860
I was going to officially do it again, so I'm wanting advice from you two.

150
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.000
We're also like allies, right?

151
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.750
No. We're not.

152
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.420
No, you should try it once.

153
00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.600
Since she likes receiving attention,

154
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.300
prepare an event in Myeongdong where everybody who passes by can see.

155
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.850
- An event? 
 - With a huge flower bouquet.

156
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.690
- A million flowers is good. 
 - Right.

157
00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.110
And... you can't leave out singing and dancing.

158
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.820
Looking at you, you should learn to b-boying. (breakdancing)

159
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.440
B-boying?

160
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:10.340
But the trend for 2020 is the Bongsan Mask Dance. It's a trend over in Hongdae.

161
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.020
Wow, you know stuff.

162
00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.300
And it's good to prepare an instrument.

163
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.910
- The gong? 
 - Castanets.

164
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.550
- Triangle. 
 - Ajaeng <i>(a bowed seven-stringed instrument)</i>.

165
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.160
Those are good, too.

166
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.500
If you can, a saxophone.

167
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.530
Wow, so nice.

168
00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.870
Older brothers... I actually majored in the saxophone.

169
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.930
That's good, man! A saxophone serenade!

170
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.330
There will be videos popping up on social media.

171
00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.700
Hari will really like it.

172
00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.070
You're such a romantic.

173
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.820
What do I do with my shoulder? My shoulder...

174
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.080
What if he's actually cool?

175
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.790
I didn't think about that.

176
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.090
Hari sometimes gets obsessed with weird things.

177
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:00.930
Mr. Eutteum?

178
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:05.560
But you know a one-sided confession may make the other feel troubled.

179
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.710
Especially if it's Jang Hari.

180
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:09.180
I know.

181
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:14.250
I think Deputy Editor has an interest in me because I have a lot of sperm.

182
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.820
Lot?

183
00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:17.140
You have a lot?

184
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.410
Yeah. 10 times the average.

185
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.130
- Wow. 
 - Does Jang Hari know that, too?

186
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.450
Yes. I told her I'd give it to her, but I think she's thinking over it.

187
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.500
So you're... the legendary sperm king?

188
00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:40.240
That's why... there are two stars.

189
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.820
<i>[Dachae Media]</i>

190
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.630
Deputy Editor, I have a question.

191
00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.040
Between a Bongsan Mask Dance and b-boying, which do you like better?

192
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.720
Bongsan what?

193
00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.000
I'm thinking about learning to dance.

194
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.970
Which do you like better?

195
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:07.390
Pick whatever you want. I'm not a fan of either.

196
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.920
Both of them are not good, I see.

197
00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.560
Why am I getting goosebumps all of a sudden?

198
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.570
Deputy Editor!

199
00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:34.520
- What kind of song do you like? 
 - What?

200
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.870
I'm planning to practice singing, so what song do you like?

201
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:44.220
Well, whatever you like. I don't particular... ly.

202
00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.100
What's this? Why am I feeling chills all of a sudden?

203
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.920
So cold.

204
00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:01.090
Are you going out to do an interview?

205
00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.690
This time, between the alto saxophone and the soprano saxophone,

206
00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.560
which do you like better?

207
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.470
Mr. Eutteum...

208
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.760
If you're planning to prepare something because you feel sorry towards me, don't do it.

209
00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.230
I can't see anything right now.

210
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.670
I'm sorry. It seems I made a huge mistake so...

211
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.130
I think it's best if you leave quickly from here.

212
00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:31.880
- What? 
 - Hurry and go inside.

213
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:38.260
Why does the back of my head itch all of a sudden?

214
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:43.390
Chief, isn't this Deputy Editor's?

215
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.500
That's probably hers. It's been there for some time. She must have left it.

216
00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.190
<i>Give it to her.</i>

217
00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.150
<i>She wouldn't find it there.</i>

218
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.490
<i>[DoReMi Song]</i>

219
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:20.690
You read Deputy Editor's column, right?

220
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.060
How is she going to get pregnant?

221
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.500
If you guys don't know that, how would I know?

222
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.390
It seemed like there was someone.

223
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.130
Then we've got to help her out.

224
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:32.460
Ms. Hari doesn't know how to seduce a man at all.

225
00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:35.990
Director! Director, you shouldn't give love advice.

226
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.100
I had a lot of women interested in me back in the day.

227
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.460
Great... he's talking about "back in the day."

228
00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.100
You're just going to suggest something lame, like slipping her a message asking to meet in front of the fountain.

229
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:49.630
I'm at a loss for words. What do you take me for, a college student during the tumultuous seventies?

230
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:54.230
If you like someone, just tell them! A frontal attack—

231
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:59.130
No, no. Seduction is not me having to move,

232
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.390
but making the other move.

233
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:04.540
How?

234
00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.800
Oh my god, what a shock!

235
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.590
You surprised me.

236
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.300
Sorry.

237
00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:15.260
I've never watched someone eat before.

238
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.860
Dongha, you slide down, and then Boram, then Sooha.

239
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.590
Okay, now look at him and smile. Okay?

240
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.090
- Yes. 
 - Right.

241
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:33.110
He said he'd cut it off coldly...

242
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.780
Why's he staring at me like that?

243
00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.310
<i> You should subtly show that you're interested in them...</i>

244
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.950
<i> by your actions.</i>

245
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.550
<i> Just enough to get their attention.</i>

246
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:50.320
<i> But if you do it too obviously, then it's counterproductive.</i>

247
00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:00.910
For the next cut, they should hang upside down.

248
00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.950
And I think a playful expression would be good...

249
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:05.580
Why are you not looking at me when you talk? It's bothering me.

250
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.620
Well... It's just... a bit weird to look at you.

251
00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.200
Are you... trying to act pretty?

252
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.150
Me? Why would I?

253
00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.220
Putting my hair behind my ear?

254
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.580
- You did that. 
 - No...

255
00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.140
Is this acting pretty? It's only because my hair is falling.

256
00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:35.580
I'm just putting my hair behind. Look!  How does it look like I'm acting pretty?

257
00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:39.970
No, why... are you obviously... hitting on—

258
00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.140
No, don't be like this.

259
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.170
No, what do I not do?

260
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.370
Is it a trauma?

261
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.740
I can't even push back my hair.

262
00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:16.950
<i>I see that it couldn't be me because he feels unpleasant when I hit on him.</i>

263
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.640
<i> The shock must have been huge.</i>

264
00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.740
<i> He won't even let me look at him.</i>

265
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.800
Geez, I need some relief.

266
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.960
Oh, it's so spicy, so spicy.

267
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.970
<i>She can't handle spicy foods, so why...</i>

268
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.150
<i> When you talk, you should whisper.</i>

269
00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:14.090
<i> If you whisper, people instinctively move their ear closer.</i>

270
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.550
<i>Then... the faces get closer.</i>

271
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:21.830
<i>Then... wow! They'll, of course, be nervous.</i>

272
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.930
Oh my god... that was so spicy!

273
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.550
Why are you whispering? Speak loudly.

274
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.110
Because it's spicy.

275
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.770
Ah, so spicy!

276
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:42.480
Oh, oh! Why are your breathing sounds like that?

277
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:50.480
Why are you... do you have to eat the candy that way?

278
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:54.910
Do you want some candy? I ate it by myself. I'm sorry.

279
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:56.220
Here you go.

280
00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.150
No, no! Stop, stop. If you keep doing this,

281
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.210
i- it'll be really dangerous.

282
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.670
No, well...

283
00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.210
What becomes dangerous?

284
00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:34.060
Doctor, I'm unnecessarily so healthy.

285
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.220
In my opinion, you're unnecessarily logical.

286
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.930
You do know the phrase that it becomes a disease if you hold it in too long? Don't hold it in.

287
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:48.050
I already told you... the woman wants a child.

288
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.060
I was an "X,"  but I must still be a candidate.

289
00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:59.750
- Sorry? 
 - Doctor, I'm not even asking for a star. Just a triangle...

290
00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:05.780
Even a triangle will do.

291
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:22.110
Ah, I need to choose between b-boying and the masked dance.

292
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.180
What is he thinking about that has him so serious?

293
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.910
Senior.

294
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.850
What are you doing?

295
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.510
Nothing.

296
00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.010
You're coming from the studio, right?

297
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.680
Yes.

298
00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.210
What about Chief Han?

299
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:54.110
No. He left.

300
00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:08.550
- What is that? 
 - Red ginseng. I need the energy.

301
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:14.920
Senior! Since I can't be the only person receiving advice, I'm going to give you some advice as well.

302
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.570
- In order to seduce a man... 
 - Hey.

303
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.210
Whoa! Thank you.

304
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.550
What's that supposed to mean? Shut up and eat this?

305
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:30.680
It's quick judgment meaning it's not even worth listening to it.

306
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.410
Yum.

307
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.450
Huh? Why? There's no photoshoot today.

308
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.160
I was going to check the background papers. If there's none, I'm going to have to prepare it.

309
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.520
Are you going somewhere?

310
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.920
Ah, the hospital.

311
00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.060
Nobody is in the studio, right?

312
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.570
Oh...I don't know where Chief Han is.

313
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:01.620
Take a look, and then lock the door before you leave.

314
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.700
Okay.

315
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:04.450
Bye.

316
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.480
I should check quickly.

317
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.230
Okay, the feed...

318
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:28.570
Quickly, quickly. Oh? Why is it so stuck?

319
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:47.760
Oh my, I'm sorry. No, thank you. I'm sorry.

320
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.380
Are you okay?

321
00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.990
- Yes, yes, I'm okay. Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

322
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.300
I remembered.

323
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.610
About what?

324
00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:14.110
That day... when we first met each other...

325
00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:22.970
That day... when we first met each other...

326
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:32.660
I did something bad. I now understand what you meant by saying you were offended.

327
00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.900
Okay.

328
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.090
Is that it?

329
00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:48.110
Do I... need to say more?

330
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:51.290
Since it's all... in the past.

331
00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.790
But still, you said you were offended.

332
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.680
I mean, I have no excuse if you were to sue me, but...

333
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.160
It wasn't so unpleasant that I would sue you for it.

334
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.070
At the time... my feelings were irritable and on edge.

335
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:21.900
Yeah... but it was a warm...

336
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.390
consolation.

337
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:33.840
Then why is it so complicated for you now?

338
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.250
Back then, it was feeling that we could forget once we walked away,

339
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.680
but now, it's not the case for me or you...

340
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.750
Although it was momentary.

341
00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:00.120
Jang Hari.

342
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:03.970
But...

343
00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.630
are you sure you saw me as a man?

344
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.570
What?

345
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.030
If you're not a man, then what are you?

346
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.170
Hey! You need to get ready to go to work.

347
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.110
That... That punk.

348
00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:02.600
Our Doha likes beef soup, right?

349
00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.500
If you go today, the teacher will give it to you. Eat a lot.

350
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.330
She's coming, she's coming.

351
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:14.260
Hey. Realistically, what man in Korea would give you his sperm?

352
00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:15.920
Besides a weird man.

353
00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.850
Einstein said this,

354
00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:21.280
"Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18."

355
00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.060
Stop insisting that your opinion is correct because it's "common sense."

356
00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.590
There are certainly people out there who have donated with good intentions, so stop looking down on it.

357
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:31.000
I know your situation and I understand how you feel,

358
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.200
but I'm wondering if this is realistically possible. And of all people...

359
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.970
Why are you nagging at me when I'm taking Doha around.

360
00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:41.280
- What are your requirements? 
 - What do you mean?

361
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.280
For the sperm. What are your sperm requirements?

362
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.260
I require a one-time success.

363
00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.250
Hey! How do you know that? Do you need a scanner to see through?

364
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.500
It means I'm looking for someone who is young, healthy, and does not drink or smoke.

365
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.200
- And that... is Eutteum? 
 - What?

366
00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.640
Did you decide on Eutteum?

367
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:08.680
That... Out of the candidates, am I not in there?

368
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.730
Then will you give it to me?

369
00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:13.660
Huh?

370
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.010
I'm... a bit conservative, so...

371
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.770
Why would I give it to you? We can just marry.

372
00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:31.960
Ugh, I really can't stand you. Let's go Sister Jaeyoung! Seriously hate you.

373
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.860
You, really. Every time we talk, it's "sister, sister." Does she think I'm really her sister?

374
00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:40.890
Wait and see. "Honey, honey, honey."

<i>Artificial insemination?</i>

377
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.160
It's not impossible, but I can't confirm it'll be a success.

378
00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.840
Why doesn't your friend marry?

379
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.770
She must think it's easier to get sperm rather than a man.

380
00:30:57.770 --> 00:30:59.010
And it's easy to get sperm?

381
00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:04.870
She thinks a sperm donation is like donating blood.

382
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.800
That friend of yours, does she not want a man

383
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.930
or does she not want men?

384
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.330
That...

385
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.040
It's needless to say.

386
00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.580
She doesn't have any property?

387
00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.280
She's a serious case.

388
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:27.580
Hey, she could provide for the man and she's pretty. Seriously pretty. And lovely.

389
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.270
Then what's the problem?

390
00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.850
There's none.

391
00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.670
Sperm donation is probably better than marrying some stern man.

392
00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.470
But?

393
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:45.660
I think it'll feel weird with her marrying, but because she's saying she'll have a baby with someone else...

394
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.070
It can't be undone and I don't feel so good.

395
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.450
What would you do if you undo it? You'll date her?

396
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.570
You should date her right now.

397
00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.360
Why? Is she so pretty that she doesn't want to provide for a divorced man with a child?

398
00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.060
What's wrong with a divorced man? I even have a beautiful daughter at that!

399
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.300
That's what you think.

Let's take the pictures together for Doha's birthday party since it's a lifetime thing.

407
00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:36.960
I should be in the picture, too.

Don't use Doha. I won't go easy on you.

Yes! I can do that.

Yes, I'll buy it. Even dessert.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.000
Right? It's great.

477
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.590
Uh... today's photoshoot is getting checked at the hospital.

478
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.570
She was worried that it wasn't going to be good news.

479
00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:56.700
So we need to make sure the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.

480
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.800
Got it. I'll put in the effort.

481
00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.480
How are you getting there?

482
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.150
<i>If we went together, it's a bit... Right?</i>

483
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:18.820
I'll head directly to the hospital. I have something to do before.

484
00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:25.360
Okay. Then I'll see you later.

485
00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.300
Yeah, see you later.

486
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:52.080
- Can you hold onto it for a while? 
 - Sure thing.

487
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.830
Thank you.

488
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.340
<i>Are you sure you saw me as a man?</i>

489
00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.460
I heard the blood results were favorable. It'll be a match.

490
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:28.150
After three miscarriages and a failed IVF,

491
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:34.220
I'm afraid to show my happiness, in case I might jinx it.

492
00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.490
I know this isn't right.

493
00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:44.440
No matter the negative words, it won't win against your desperation.

494
00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:48.060
It'll turn out well.

495
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:05.390
You see the baby here, right?

496
00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.560
Congratulations. She is pregnant.

497
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.800
Honey.

498
00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.420
You did well.

499
00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.890
Congratulations!

500
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:36.030
Thank you.

501
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:40.740
I don't know yet. I don't think I can let down my guard until it's a sure thing.

502
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.770
Let's just be happy for today.

503
00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.810
I'll also wholeheartedly congratulate you.

504
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.420
<i>ETTOI: Premium European Looks for Baby &amp; Child]</i>

505
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:53.730
When did you prepare something like this?

506
00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.050
Honey, look at this. I bet the baby's feet will really be about this size.

507
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.460
It feels weird.

508
00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.030
I have something to give you.

509
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.600
This is my present.

510
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:18.690
What's this?

511
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:26.120
I know it wasn't easy for me, but I know you have a hard road ahead of you.

512
00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.490
Please receive my successful energy.

513
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.420
Thank you.

514
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.370
Is that small thing the baby?

515
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:48.450
Yes. It's good-looking, isn't it?

516
00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:51.030
It's going to become a great adult.

517
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:54.290
It really is good-looking.

518
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:58.670
A baby conceived with such sincerity

519
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:01.490
would have no reason not to be pretty.

520
00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.660
I can't tell you who it is.

521
00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:13.790
Okay.

522
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:18.440
I have confessed, but I think in the wrong way.

523
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.260
So, in order to properly do it, I got advice but don't think that's it either.

524
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.930
Have you been single all your life?

525
00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:28.790
No. I've received a lot of confessions.

526
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:31.910
But this is my first time doing it.

527
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.250
You must have dated a lot of girlfriends.

528
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.680
Yeah. But I didn't date them for long.

529
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:43.400
They all say that they get a lot of anger after meeting me, but I'm not sure why.

530
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.550
I think I know.

531
00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.040
But... you must like her a lot.

532
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:52.000
To the point that you want to confess for the first time.

533
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.080
About that, to be honest...

534
00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.960
I'm not quite sure.

535
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:05.400
I feel drawn to her, but is it love? In any case, we'll have to date first to figure that out.

536
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.400
How irresponsible. Isn't that a bit much?

537
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.060
Is it wrong to confess when you're interested enough to consider dating someone?

538
00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:17.600
When you start dating and your feelings grow, then that becomes love. Right?

539
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:22.430
Well, if that's how you think of it, then try confessing.

540
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:26.350
If you follow my instructions, you'll be successful. Write this down.

541
00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.970
Yes, of course.

542
00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.390
Laying down a candle lined path.

543
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.800
"Laying down a candle lined..."

544
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.890
Making a heart-shaped floral decoration and stand inside it...

545
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:38.750
"...<i>heart shaped floral decorations and..."</i>

546
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.120
Don't do any of that.

547
00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:45.470
Aren't those the sort of things women like?

548
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.600
Are you going to extinguish all one hundred candles afterward?

549
00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.200
I'll probably feel dizzy.

550
00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:57.830
And confessing where there are a tons of people, that's just the worst!

551
00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.480
They told me to do it in front of a lot of people.

552
00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:02.470
These brothers, really!

553
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.440
Then what should I do?

554
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:09.650
You don't anything but a ring.

555
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.030
Car-ti-er.

556
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.260
Car-ti-er? Cartier?

557
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.850
"My one and only love."

558
00:44:16.850 --> 00:44:21.450
They have serial numbers so she would know that ring was hers and hers only.

559
00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:23.670
What more could you need?

560
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.030
"You're my only one." The ring would do all the talking.

561
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.210
C-Cartier, you say?

562
00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:35.620
Car-ti-er. The heart ring.

563
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.700
Twenty-five hundred do—

564
00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.550
A ring has a lot of meaning.

565
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.260
It's not that it's a designer brand, it's asking the girl to commit

566
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.550
to being his one and only love.

567
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.600
A promise.

568
00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.680
A months' worth of wages...

569
00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.940
If you get that, it's over a 250% chance of success.

570
00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.490
<i>Am I going to be wearing a ring?</i>

571
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.810
Look at this.

572
00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:16.830
What's this?

573
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:20.120
We're going to live comfortably. Who needs success?

574
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.970
Living happily is enough.

575
00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:24.750
But if I could hope for a bit, it would be this.

576
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.550
I hope she'll pick the stethoscope.

577
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:28.530
Why are you putting the one you want there?

578
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.300
Food is the most important.

579
00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.400
Don't be silly, health is most important.

580
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.420
Here you go.

581
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:39.030
Here you go, Doha... My goodness!

582
00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.750
Where are you going to have the baby's selection to take place? 
<i>(T/N: Korean tradition for the baby to pick a significant object on 1st birthday)</i>

583
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:45.950
I was planning on doing it when she had her picture taken.

584
00:45:45.950 --> 00:45:47.970
What about the rice cake? Did you order it?

585
00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:49.820
Do we need a rice cake?

586
00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.490
How are you going to dress her?

587
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.530
This is pretty.

588
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:56.730
He didn't prepare anything.

589
00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:03.050
This is pretty, too.

590
00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:05.220
Isn't it?

591
00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:08.150
The studio says they'll lend us a nice outfit.

592
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.530
What if they don't have anything that looks good on her?

593
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.470
They can just make do, I suppose.

594
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:13.780
"I suppose?"

595
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:14.890
Couldn't they?

596
00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.430
You, you!

597
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:22.020
This is her one and only first birthday. You've got to dress her nicely!

598
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.160
These colors look so good on you! Oh, how pretty!

599
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.070
- So ugly... 
 - Have you lost your mind?

600
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.570
Why do you look especially awful today, even worse than usual?

601
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.790
You want to fight? Here? Come at me.

602
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:38.230
Enough!  You'll make yourself look worse.

603
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:39.690
Just ring them up.

604
00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:42.870
Are you nuts? Just wait and see if I don't.

605
00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:50.810
Give it.

606
00:46:50.810 --> 00:46:52.410
I'm fine!  It's not that heavy.

607
00:46:52.410 --> 00:46:54.760
Why are you acting like this all of a sudden?

608
00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:58.540
- Give it to me. 
 - I said it's fine! Why are you like this?

609
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:00.930
Push that stroller instead.

610
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:05.580
If you've made a purchase of at least $50, please enjoy a $100 certificate for a Hanwoo dinner.

611
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.900
Is this a lottery drawing?

612
00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:15.360
No, as long as you can show me a receipt that shows you've spent at least $50

613
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.060
and confirm that you're members of the same household, that's all I need.

614
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.000
Honey, do you have that receipt?

615
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.790
Oh, looks like you saved it, Dear. You did good.

616
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:24.810
You don't need proof of family ties, right?

617
00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:28.490
Just write down your contact info, grab your voucher, and just come in with a family of four.

618
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.430
Baby? You write it down.

619
00:47:30.430 --> 00:47:33.230
Should I? All right, Honey.

620
00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:38.200
That's good.

621
00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:41.900
Those people aren't a couple.

622
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.570
Are you scamming them in order to eat Korean beef?

623
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.190
My goodness...

624
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:04.540
What is this?

625
00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:09.390
Give me Doha, and you eat.

626
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.890
Come to daddy!

627
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.830
All right, all right.

628
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:17.260
Oh, goodness.

629
00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.180
Doha, because of you, I can't use my hands.

630
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.230
Use them well. You have two hands.

631
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:29.860
I'm in a situation where I can't use either of them, and I'm very hungry.

632
00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:34.100
Ah, so yummy.

633
00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:41.190
Don't try so hard, Mr. Han Yisang. I don't you're it.

634
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:45.310
Unless you have something to win against the king.

635
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.260
What nonsense are you saying? To the person who's buying us the meat.

636
00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.000
Mr. Han also knows.

637
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.920
Eutteum, to us two, revealed himself to be the king.

638
00:48:57.520 --> 00:48:59.720
He read your column so he should know.

639
00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.080
Also, she doesn't have any interest in men.

640
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.940
She has a separate goal in mind.

641
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.490
I know.

642
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:15.830
But... even if I knew, would anything change?

643
00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:33.400
<i>[Recruiting Students]</i>

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.310
"Leather crafts."

645
00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.870
I've never tried this before.

646
00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:44.690
Oh, I've never tried this before.

647
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:10.400
Senior, can I get the contact info for Leila's mother?

648
00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.760
Leila's mom? Hold on.

649
00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.670
Leila...

650
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:25.920
Sohyun, my diary— You said it was at Jambi, right?

651
00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.060
Yes, it was in the corner table.

652
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:15.170
You read my diary, didn't you?

653
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.510
You should've gotten angry and argued with me.

654
00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:30.550
How can I get angry at someone who gave me extra 5 points for the character?

655
00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:36.760
You should've gotten angry... in order for me to apologize.

656
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:45.090
I'm sorry that I graded you that way. I shouldn't grade people in that manner.

657
00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:50.020
I didn't have any expectations of men.

658
00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:54.000
Even then, I didn't look at you as a joke.

659
00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:01.800
I felt the three of you... would have understood and helped me.

660
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:10.850
Even if you apologized and we reconciled, I can't help you.

661
00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:14.390
That's why I didn't get mad.

662
00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.590
I know.

663
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:28.960
What I want to say is... I didn't know your intentions for asking if I only see you as a man, and that's why I couldn't answer.

664
00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.360
Because I was afraid I'd make another mistake.

665
00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:37.730
I don't have any other intentions.

666
00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:45.970
Now... I only see you as a man.

667
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:57.750
Jang Hari...

668
00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:03.860
Not now, but when you can only think about your heart, give me your answer then.

669
00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.030
If you don't, you'll lose me.

670
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:04.640
Can't you just give in for once?

671
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.140
You know you also have feelings for her.

672
00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.970
You should be honest with your feelings once in a while.

673
00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:12.860
Can you get rid of your feelings by hiding them?

674
00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.420
I know that I'm wrong and cowardly.

675
00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:29.590
But unfortunately... Jang Hari and I have no chance.

676
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:39.230
<i>I don't like kids, but Jang Hari is fighting to have one.</i>

677
00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:45.360
<i>It's not a problem of giving in to the other,</i>

678
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:52.680
<i>we just want different lives.</i>

679
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.620
Is life a taxi? That it'll go in the direction that you want?

680
00:54:56.620 --> 00:55:01.820
It looks like you closed your heart after you broke up with Inah. But it's all in the past.

681
00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.180
Just go with your heart.

682
00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:08.190
Live as if you were a cloud being blown about by the wind.

683
00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:42.550
<i>I also want to follow my heart and be like other normal couples,</i>

684
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:48.590
<i>want to hold the hand that Jang Hari is holding out.</i>

685
00:55:55.660 --> 00:56:01.440
<i>As if it was a mistake, I wanted to sway and</i>

686
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.980
<i>approach you.</i>

687
00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:16.370
<i>I also wanted to hold your hand.</i>

688
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:28.360
<i>My heart that I closed to not get hurt...</i>
