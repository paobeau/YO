32
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.830
I hadn’t had the time yet to tell Qingchen about the situation between Sir Tang and me.

33
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.230
I hid it from him for so long, he must be really angry.

34
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.290
What should I do, Tan Baba?

35
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.060
Adviser, don't worry too much.

36
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.270
This shameful husband must ultimately see his wife's younger brother, right?

37
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.060
Qingchen still hasn't come out.

38
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.800
The door to Sir's room is locked tightly. Nothing could have happened, right?

39
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.430
Is there nothing that Sir Tang wants to say?

40
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.500
What is it that you want to ask?

41
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.050
There are many questions. Please answer them truthfully.

42
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.200
I won't keep anything from you.

43
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.070
Sir Tang, my older sister came to the government office only in order to gather source material.

44
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.080
She never thought of standing out among everyone as an official.

45
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070
In these three months, she has entered prison and suffered injuries.

46
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.490
And now, she has even been slandered as a murderer.

47
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.840
Sir, ask yourself, do you have the ability to protect her?

48
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.630
Qingchen, I am genuine and sincere in my feelings for your sister.

49
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.840
Allowing her to be trapped in the middle of a quarrel of course isn't my real intention.

50
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.930
I understand you.

51
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.840
I can guarantee that from now on, I won't allow her to feel the least bit wronged.

52
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.650
What will you use to guarantee this?

53
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.310
With all due to respect, you pretended to be a corrupt officer and tricked Sun Yuanwai and the others.

54
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.470
You used Sun Bufan to create a big issue,

55
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.990
and caused an internal conflict between the upper class in Tongling.

56
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.490
All of these were just so that you can investigate the gold mine case.

57
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.820
Sir, you are a complicated man.

58
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.090
If only she were as intelligent as you.

59
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.000
Although I do not have any blood relation with my sister,

60
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.260
but after my mother died so the two of us have relied on one another to survive.

61
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.730
So, Sir, you should understand how much I value my sister.

62
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.860
I comprehend what you mean and understand you.

63
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.260
But I also value your sister very much.

64
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.470
Sir, there is no need for you to force someone to do something.

65
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.770
There are numerous women in the world. My sister really isn't a good match for you.

66
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.400
Moreover, my sister must marry a person of a similar class as Tang Tianyuan.

67
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.360
In all likelihood, you have also heard about him to some extent.

68
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.750
Tang Tianyuan is the prototype for all of the characters in my sister's books.

69
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.790
From this, my sister's infatuation with him can clearly be seen.



71
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.060
I am Tang Tianyuan.

72
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.340
I was ordered to handle the case here by the imperial decree.

73
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.290
I not deliberately hiding the truth but I don't want to endanger her.

74
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.190
But how long can you hide this from her?

75
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:22.450
My sister worships you, but you are playing with her like this.

76
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.960
So this time, I plan to spare no effort in asking for her forgiveness.

77
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.900
So I can be worthy of her sincere feelings for me.

78
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.840
I will inform her about all of this.

79
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.690
Please don't.

80
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.290
Sir Tang, for the time being, please do not inform my sister.

81
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.630
Why?

82
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.730
A lot of people are involved in the gold case.  Sister is already in danger for what little she knows.

83
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.170
If she knew the truth now,

84
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.780
I'm scared it would cause her more danger.

85
00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.860
Not to even mention, my sister is a straightforward person, she doesn't like being lied to.

86
00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.880
Let's discuss this matter later on.

87
00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.580
<i>[Meet me at my place.]</i>

88
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.080
<i>[Shenghong Pavilion]</i>

89
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.100
You're awake.

90
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:54.070
You caught a cold.

91
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.960
Here, drink this medicine.

92
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.120
I don't need you to watch over me.

93
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.610
You can be unwilling to see me,

94
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:12.600
but you must take your medicine punctually.

95
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.180
The medicine in this box is enough for you to use for a year.

96
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.720
The prescription is also inside.

97
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.600
There is another matter which I must tell you about.

98
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.000
You had never been poisoned

99
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.490
and had never been subjected to my shackles because of poisoning.

100
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.240
It's only that from when you were small, your body has been weak.

101
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.860
You had to take medicine every day.

102
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.090
For not telling you the truth, I am sorry.

103
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.340
What is it that you want me to do for you this time?

104
00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.470
This medicine has no color and no flavor.

105
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.610
As long as it is sprinkled on the furniture of the bedroom,

106
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:55.980
the person who gets poisoned will have their entire body fester and die in three days.

107
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.400
This is indeed something that even the gods will not be aware of and ghosts will not be conscious of.

108
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.920
You are... ready to let me go?

109
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.080
After this business is taken care of, no one will know of your past,

110
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.770
and no one will investigate your past.

111
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:15.140
You and I will break all ties

112
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.860
and can be considered even.

113
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.470
It really looks good.

114
00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.290
Sister, do you really like Sir Tang?

115
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.100
But didn't you say before

116
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.610
that you must marry a person that is as upright as Tang Tianyuan?

117
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.860
If Tang Tianyuan appeared in front of you right now,

118
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.050
would you still choose Tang Feilong, Sir Tang?

119
00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.340
Look. The moon tonight is very round.

120
00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.450
Sis!

121
00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.720
I have heard a lot about Tang Tianyuan.

122
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.610
He's...

123
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.850
an honorable and righteous man.

124
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:11.890
LIke other girls, I chased after him.

125
00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.130
Who wouldn't like someone like that?

126
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:18.230
Also, he's done a great favor for me.

127
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:22.240
But being grateful is one thing. Love and gratefulness are different, right?

128
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.660
Yes.

129
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:27.210
Therefore, I thought about it.

130
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.610
He is still my aspiration.

131
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.800
LIke him, I want to be someone who is righteous that brings justice.

132
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.680
He's like the moon.

133
00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.190
Faraway and shining brightly,

134
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.060
No matter where I go, when I look up,

135
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:51.150
he'll always be there. Always...

136
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.340
untouchable.

137
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.650
What about Tang Feilong?

138
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.590
He is like a fire in the winter cold.

139
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.850
You can't hold yourself back. You just want to be a little closer,

140
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:11.850
and even closer.

141
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.400
♫<i> Maybe I shouldn't have </i>♫

142
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.210
♫<i> I didn't foresee this surprise </i>♫

143
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.590
♫<i> I thought there was still love between us </i>♫

144
00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.110
Mother left us early.

145
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:26.270
Although we lived care-free,

146
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.970
it felt like we didn't have our own home.

147
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:37.600
So, I really want to stay by his side.

148
00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.970
But, Sister, I'm worried about you.

149
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:45.370
You are my only relative.

150
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.340
if Sir Tang can't keep you safe,

151
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.600
I hope you can return to the life you had before you met him.

152
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.240
At least it's stable, we don't have to worry about you.

153
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.690
It's too late now. I've fallen too deep.

154
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:02.960
I must stay with him. Our hearts have become one, and must go wherever he goes.

155
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.300
What if one day you discovered that Sir Tang was different than what you expected?

156
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.200
Would you leave him?

157
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.100
Of course not!

158
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.770
Whatever he's thinking, I know him well.

159
00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.010
If he bullies me,

160
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.950
I'll... I'll disappear from his sight.

161
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.670
- Sister Lingyin, come light the fireworks! Come quickly. 
 - Okay

162
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.590
Come on. Don't worry.

163
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.730
<i>Sir Tang, please don't tell older sister yet.</i>

164
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.320
<i>There's too much involved in the gold case.</i>

165
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.970
<i>She only knows a little bit and is already in danger.</i>

166
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.820
<i>If she knows the truth, I'm afraid it'll further endanger her.</i>

167
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.330
<i>Besides, Sister Lingyin is a straightforward person.</i>

168
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:42.810
<i>She can't accept being lied to.</i>

169
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.050
<i>Let's put it aside for now.</i>

170
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.360
Sir,

171
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.120
what are you thinking about?

172
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.160
Nothing.

173
00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.710
Thinking of Adviser Tan, right?

174
00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:02.610
When my wife and I first got together, I thought about her every day, too.

175
00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:04.840
I said it was nothing.

176
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:07.230
Why are you being shy with me?

177
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.500
It's not like I've never liked someone before.

178
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.700
Sir, take a look.

179
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.890
This is the portrait of the refugee that Adviser Tan drew.

180
00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.190
She said the refugee she met that day, is this man.

181
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:26.130
But I really don't know how I should describe the essence of this portrait to our men.

182
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.140
They all said this portrait looks a lot like me when I was younger.

183
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.740
Indeed, it does.

184
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.200
What?

185
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.690
Let's wait till tomorrow when she comes to the county office and have her draw another one.

186
00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.940
Yes, Sir. I'll excuse myself.

187
00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.230
- Oh, right.
 - Sir, anything else you need?

188
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:47.230
I have a question for you.

189
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:49.770
I have a friend.

190
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.800
- Friend? 
 - Right, friend of mine.

191
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.800
Because of some personal reasons, he had lied to his wife.

192
00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.770
Lied to her?

193
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.650
I want to ask, in this case,

194
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.240
will your wife forgive you?

195
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:09.600
It depends on how serious it is.

196
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.570
Is it keeping a mistress?

197
00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.240
Or having a stash of money?

198
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.390
Something more serious.

199
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.940
More serious?

200
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.930
Yes.

201
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.830
As for my wife, it depends on her mental

202
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.110
and physical involvement.

203
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:29.840
Mentally,

204
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.700
it's a white lie.

205
00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.130
A white lie.

206
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.260
As for physical,

207
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:40.130
no one is hurt yet.

208
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.250
No one's hurt. My wife...

209
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.280
would never let me off no matter what.

210
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:50.190
So, all I can do is

211
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.940
avoid getting her angry so I can live a long life.

212
00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.870
All right,

213
00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.080
you may leave.

214
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.500
I'm going to head out later.

215
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.050
Head out?

216
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.280
Adviser Tan is not at the bookstore.

217
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.340
Who told you I'm going to meet Adviser Tan?

218
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.670
Not meet with Adviser Tan?

219
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:20.860
She's not playing "The Little Fairy" tonight, is she?

220
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.950
I can do it!

221
00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:01.530
It's pretty good!

222
00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.730
My Lady is beautiful.

223
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.840
Where did she learn this from?

224
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.440
Something you don't know, eh? Recently,

225
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.370
she's been to Miaosheng House often to learn dancing from Miss Ruyi.

226
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.370
A few days back, Miss Ruyi requested a few days off.

227
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.700
Lingyin came to give it a try.

228
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.320
Don't you have other dancers?

229
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.370
Her dream as a child was to learn to dance.

230
00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:58.660
You don't know about this?

231
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:11.400
Since Miaosheng House will close down soon,

232
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.040
I don't think it's necessary for you to linger here in Tongling.

233
00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.960
In my opinion, you should go back to Jingnan

234
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.530
and continue to be a rich playboy.

235
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.900
Tang Feilong,

236
00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:26.580
do you think I'll admit defeat?

237
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:30.700
I know she likes you now.

238
00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.900
But her liking you has no conflict with me liking her?

239
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.760
As long as she hasn't married you, I still have a chance.

240
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:44.430
Who knows? Maybe on a lucky day something bad may happen to you.

241
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.460
Great!

242
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.630
So pretty!

243
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.880
<i>Be careful</i>

244
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.750
<i>Wow! This is so wonderful!</i>

245
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.900
<i>They are a perfect couple!</i>

246
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.170
<i>Sir Tang!</i>

247
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.200
<i>Who would have thought?</i>

248
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.410
♫ <i> The swaying branches of the weeping willow,
a home with a bridge over a flowing creek </i> ♫

249
00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:49.690
What's so nice about this?

250
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:50.650
Stop talking!

251
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:52.880
♫ <i> I hear a pipa’s tune transmitted from afar </i>♫

252
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.980
What's good about any of this!

253
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.260
Why did you come?

254
00:18:57.260 --> 00:19:00.180
Had enough fun?

255
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.030
Let's go home.

256
00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:09.200
♫ <i> Your smile is brighter than the moon 
and puts flowers to shame </i> ♫

257
00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.930
I saw how great Miss Zhou's dance was...

258
00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.060
I wanted to give you a surprise

259
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:20.600
You looked great dancing but in the future, can you stop dancing?

260
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.920
Jealous?

261
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.690
Are you afraid of everyone in Tongling falling in love with me?

262
00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.640
Then it's not just Zhu Dacong chasing me anymore.

263
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.690
I don't care how many Zhu Dacong's there are.

264
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:33.720
I just think it's too dangerous.

265
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.090
You're jealous and you won't admit it.

266
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.990
What's so hard about admitting it?

267
00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:45.040
♫ <i>I’m destined to protect you in this lifetime </i> ♫

268
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.570
Is it pretty?

269
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.450
This red doesn't suit you.

270
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.530
This one's pretty cute.

271
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.030
Put it on for me.

272
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.910
♫  <i>Filling the world with my concerns, I look for her everywhere </i> ♫

273
00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:20.020
♫ <i> A life that was supposed to be lived freely is now wasted </i>  ♫

275
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.970
Pretty?

276
00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.950
Pretty.

277
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.920
- Spend your money! 
 - This one costs 3 taels.

278
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:34.440
Thank you.

279
00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:36.690
Let's go!

280
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:43.950
<i>[Be of good virtue and diligent]</i>

281
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:51.120
I can't anymore!

282
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.280
Then rest for a bit. Then go for another few minutes.

283
00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.130
No more, I'm so tired.

284
00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.270
Compared to useless hobbies like dancing,

285
00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:03.010
learning martial arts is more practical. It's self-defense.

286
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.470
But aren't you here?

287
00:21:07.790 --> 00:21:09.420
Lingyin,

288
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:12.770
I'm not your shadow. I can't follow you around all day.

289
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:15.960
We haven't found the refugee that attacked you.

290
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.880
If you encounter him again, what are you going to do?

291
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.050
That's impossible. Why would I be so unlucky?

292
00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:25.340
Where's Zheng Shaofeng? Let him teach you.

293
00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.300
I haven't seen him in days.

294
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.880
He's probably on a date with his beauty on Mount Tianmu.

295
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.960
Look at Constable Zheng!

296
00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.690
Even a rough guy like him understands romance.

297
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.150
He embroiders lotus flowers and goes chicken hunting at Mount Tianmu.

298
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:46.400
What about you? Keeping me here to do squats daily.

299
00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.320
You want to hunt for chickens, too?

300
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:53.990
How about we hunt something else today?

301
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:55.020
Really?

302
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.380
Really.

303
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.290
Sir, wear this for me.

304
00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:05.160
Just wear it.

305
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.880
No, it's too dumb.

306
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.540
Then I'm leaving.

307
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:11.600
I didn't bring any fireworks.

308
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.010
If you don't want to be taken by wolves, don't run around.

309
00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.670
Constable Zheng is so nice to Miss Ruyi.

310
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:21.190
If he holds her in his palms, he's afraid she'll fall. If he keeps her in his mouth, he's afraid she'll melt.

311
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:24.990
And you? You treat me like your servant.

312
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.120
I'm afraid you're too heavy to be held in my palms.

313
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.050
How about you get on the horse?

314
00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:39.780
Deer! Look, Sir, there's a deer here.

315
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.300
Give me the bow.

316
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.460

320

If I come back empty-handed, he'll look down on me.

321
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.030
Immature. Why compare stuff like this?

322
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:00.820
Shouldn't you guys compare the good traits of your lovers?

323
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.480
He says there's a cliff cave near here. Let's take a look.

324
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.890
What? Why don't you say something?

325
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.290
Say something.

326
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:12.380
Is it because I have too many good traits? You can't mention all of them?

327
00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.730
Anything. Just say one.

328
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.090
Stop talking. I'm thinking.

329
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.700
So this is the cave.

330
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:39.950
There's dry wood and a fire... 
<i> (T/N: also an idiom that expresses passionate feelings between a couple)</i>

331
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:44.420
Constable Zheng and Miss Ruyi were probably here on a date.

332
00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.370
He sure knows how to choose a place.

333

What are you looking at?

334
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.800
This is dry grass that was placed down for sleeping.

335
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.910
And those marks on the wall

336
00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:08.790
were probably used to count days.

337

If I guessed correctly,

338
00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:14.740
this place is the hideaway for refugees.

339
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:20.430
Refugees? Haven't they all died?

340
00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:23.960
Then was the one you met on the street a ghost?

341

That's right.

342
00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:30.190
He must've stayed here after successfully escaping from Sang Jie.

343
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.090
If we find him, do we also find the evidence?

We didn't earn much these last few days either.

How long are you going to hold out for until we close down?

350
00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.750

351
00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.000
and agrees to go back to Jinan with me.

352

His nose was thin.

His mouth was a little pouty.

Thin lips suggest he's cold-hearted.

Someone who's easily offended and quick to start arguments.

378

It's true that he's ugly.

a flat nose and thin lips. Doesn't he look like this?

Sir, there's a lady outside

Escaping from marriage?

Isn't she the female version of Zhu Dacong?

396

A man who can do such a thing is extremely irresponsible.

You can't trust him with your life.

♫<i> Do I still love? Is love still there? </i>♫

475

♫<i> The verdict never comes </i>♫

479
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.780
Assistant Zhou, you're finally back!

480
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.770
Constable Zheng has been looking for your sister...

481
00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.310
and you. He looked for a long time, and just couldn't find you guys.

482
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.060
He always says you guys disappear together.

483
00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.540
Convinced that both of you were kidnapped, he wanted to call the authorities. Thank goodness we stopped him.

484
00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:36.000
Go talk some sense into him.

485
00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.940
Zheng Shaofeng!

486
00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:48.860
Get up.

487
00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.240
- What? 
 - Is it necessary to go as far as to death for a woman?

488
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.300
I-I'm thirsty. I'm drinking some water.

489
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.480
What are you doing?

490
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:07.130
Drink... If you want to drink, there's a bucket.

491
00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.770
Where's your sister?

492
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.640
Your sister! Where did she go?

493
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.240
She's been gone for two days and one night.

494
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:24.520
She went back to the old home.

495
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.780
That's impossible.

496
00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.040
Miss Ruyi is still bound by contract to Miaosheng House. How can she just leave?

497
00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.410
Tell me. Where exactly did she go?

498
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.760
Someone is sick at the old home. She'll come back in a few days.

499
00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.740
- Then I'll go find her.  
 - Don't!

500
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.280
You can't go! She hates when people take matters into their own hands.

501
00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:46.890
If you go, wouldn't everyone know that she's a dancer in Tongling?

502
00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.300
That's true.

503
00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.890
But do you think...

504
00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.950
she'll come back?

505
00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.060
Today's the start of Cold Dew. 
 <i> (T/N: a phase in Chinese solar calendar)</i>

506
00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:10.420
It will start becoming cold tonight.

507
00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.810
Miss Ruyi usually doesn't wear much.

508
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:18.070
I don't know if she'll get sick.

509
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:23.120
She also doesn't sleep well.

510
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:28.290
But it's good. The weather has been cool these few days.

511
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.470
She can sleep soundly.

512
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.710
♫<i> I'm afraid that without your presence </i>♫

513
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.680
Constable Zheng, we're deep in this gold case.

514
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.880
Sir Tang has already involved himself. You know that you can still get yourself out of this.

515
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.510
Why are you still getting yourself into this?

516
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.810
♫ <i>The future is long, please take care of me</i> ♫

517
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.060
My brothers are here.

518
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.260
The things I want to do are here.

519
00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.020
And the people I treasure the most are all here.

520
00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:07.070
This is my home. I can't leave.

521
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:16.690
What will you do if the person in your heart doesn't come back?

522
00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.760
♫ <i>This indecisive feeling</i> ♫

523
00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.780
Then I'll wait for her.

524
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.490
One month.

525
00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.950
One year.

526
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.140
Or ten years.

527
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.570
Perhaps by then,

528
00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:38.360
Miss Ruyi will have already forgotten me.

529
00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.860
But how long is time?

530
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:45.880
I think I'll have to wait until I'm buried

531
00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.890
to know.

532
00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.670
Don't wait.

533
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:57.070
Miss Ruyi....

534
00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.620
Miss Ruyi—

535
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:04.830
Zheng Shaofeng, what's wrong?

536
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:08.700
