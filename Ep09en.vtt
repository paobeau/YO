(Previously on Episode 8)
Pluck flowers when they bloom best.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You'll regret it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
if Zhou Xiao becomes
another guy's girlfriend.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why would Zhou Xiao come for the interview?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Because I like her.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll take care of the women's singles.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhu Lu, I'll train you first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You were obviously enchanted by me.

(Episode 9:
Trilling Experience in the Library)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
(Congratulations on the 100th anniversary
of Nanfang University)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why don't we

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
use our authority and sneak in?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Ms. Huang.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
you just came at the right time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I need to scan a batch of precious literature

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
so that students can borrow the copies.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I scanned half of it
and have to attend a meeting now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Help me finish the work.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you new here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello, Ms. Huang. My name is Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm here to return this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Take it in

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and help Zhao Fanzhou out.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
By the way,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
remember to hand in your application forms

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for entering the literature room
when you're done.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay, Ms. Huang.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Goodbye, Ms. Huang.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Bye.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
See?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Good people always get something for nothing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's a block-printed book
of the early Qing dynasty.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
(Ink out, please replace the cartridge.)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
can I take photos of it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you know Longtu Cases?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Ancient detective novels

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
like Bao Gong Solving Cases

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
all came from it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I didn't expect there would be

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
one in the library.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Help me scan the book.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I need to wash my hands.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You don't have to go to the bathroom.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I have wet tissues.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll help you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
There.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Your hands are clean now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can I keep taking photos of Longtu Cases?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll help you with scanning when I'm done.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What can I do for you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Arrange these printed papers

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and fasten them together.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Like this?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's going on?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Where's your phone?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What time is it now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I don't know.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My phone is dead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The library is closing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Let's go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll go fetch my bag.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
OK.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What do we do now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Where's your phone?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't tell me you haven't got it on you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's in the office upstairs. Let's go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Have you watched Night at the Museum?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've always imagined that I'm locked

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
in museums, libraries,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
supermarkets, malls and so on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My dream came true today.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Congratulations.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My phone is locked in.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What do we do?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are we really going to be locked here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't sweat it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll turn on lamps of the reading area.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
They're not controlled by the master switch.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
If there's light,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
perhaps someone will find us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll check if any chargers are left here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No one turned up

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and I couldn't find any chargers.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Will we freeze to death here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll get you something to keep you warm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you know how Eskimos keep

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
themselves warm?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I had no idea

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
we would be able to do this

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
in the library.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's what you wanted to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm just cooperating.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wait.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't force it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Be gentle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I can do it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Trust me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Go on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Be gentle.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We built an ice house of Eskimos.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll go in first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's quite warm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It seems that Eskimos are as smart as me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Come on in.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's cold outside.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sit on this.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The floor is cold.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This is fun.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm going to write this in my novel.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It seems you can be happy

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
no matter what happens.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That's not really true.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I actually cry a lot.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I remember when I was a kid,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
my mom was driven mad by my crying

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and locked me in my bedroom.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
And then

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
when she released me,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
she found that I was playing
myself and laughing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've seen that when school started.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Really?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Did I cry?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
On the day of registration,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
you cried while reading
Journey Under the Midnight Sun.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's touching.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Keigo Higshino's books are so good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Then you said my phone seemed to be farting
when it vibrated.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
And

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
don't you think when his phone
vibrated just now,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
it sounded like someone's farting?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You laughed in the end.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You're talking as if I'm a fool.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Oh,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm so sleepy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I wanna sleep for a while.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
OK.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll let you be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
OK.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Before I met you,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I was especially afraid of seeing people cry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
After I met you,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
it seems

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I can understand this emotion now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you sure that girl never came?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Did you find her?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've looked for her in the VR Hall
we went to before

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
but I still didn't find her.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Did he find Xiao?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Have you searched the school carefully?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll go back and search again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay, check again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We found her. We found her.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Where have you been?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sorry. Sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Is she alright?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Put her on the phone.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hold on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's wrong with you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you know we've been
worried sick about you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm sorry. My bad. My bad.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Say it to Cai Yasi yourself.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hey.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao, are you crazy?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why didn't you come back
to your dorm all night?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've been looking
for you since the early morning.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Were you kidnapped by aliens?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm going deaf.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Calm down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Last night

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
my phone was out of power

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and I was locked in the library.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Stay where you are.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm coming.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't come here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I don't wanna be strangled by you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Go back to your dorm
and catch up on your sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll treat you and apologize later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It'll cost you dearly.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's wrong with you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You have no idea how worried we were.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes, we've been worried sick.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We thought you were kidnapped.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll make amends to you later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Let's take the course first.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Class will begin now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay. That's all

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for today's class.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
But still

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I need to recommend

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
my favorite writer to you,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wang Zengqi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We're in college

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
but we're still being kept overtime.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
As you know,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
he's King Shu of Overtime.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He even thought

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that Wang Zengqi wrote

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
better than him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Isn't that strange?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
So he thought the most adorable side

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of Wang Zengqi

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
was his attitude towards writing,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
which is not being affected
by favor or despite.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
After I analyzed these things,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
you have got to...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Who's that furtive guy outside

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
waiting for?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Professor, me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The class is not over yet

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and your boyfriend can't wait already.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's the matter with you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No, no, no.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He's my younger brother.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He is

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
got problems here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He once burned an Internet bar

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and fought a group of people.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The other day

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
he even hacked

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
our campus network.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I have no idea what trouble he is in now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Has he beaten any teachers?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What a novelist.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay. Where... where was I?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Oh, yes,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I was talking

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
about Wang Zengqi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I said it was my treat

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
but you offered to swipe your card.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Looks like I can even win a lottery now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You haven't told me what happened last night

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and why you were locked in the library.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't mention that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yesterday I worked in the Room

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of Precious Literature
and it's on basement-1.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That staff didn't know that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and locked us inside.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Us?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhao Fanzhou was locked there, too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What did you say?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Who were you locked for a night with?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't get so vehement.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sit down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You stayed with a man alone.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can you watch your deeds

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
as a girl?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How should I watch my deeds?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I didn't do that on purpose.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Besides, my phone was dead

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and Zhao Fanzhou's was locked in a cupboard.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We were going to break

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
a window to get out of there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
So what did you do last night?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sleep.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Closed our eyes and slept separately.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You're speaking like my dad.
Have you realized that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I shall tell your dad about this matter.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't you dare.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Cai Yasi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Guan Bei.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why didn't you go

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
to the training of ACM today?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I needed to do something else.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Let me introduce you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This is my classmate,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Guan Bei.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
She's my childhood friend, Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you going to the training this afternoon?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes. But I also have a rehearsal

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
so I may leave early.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Well, shall I tell you
about this morning's lesson?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why not? Have a seat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This morning the professor

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
talked about

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
exponential data sampling.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I know that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Fast exponential sampling.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Awesome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Where are you going?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Go on with your talk.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I have to be a volunteer and labor.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You have no talents. You deserve it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
By the way...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My younger brother has grown up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How many members does
Programming Association have?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
More than twenty.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Come in.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Dozens of us can take part in the activity.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Have a seat.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can you pick up and see off guests?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay. No problem.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Then we'll leave it to you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That's alright.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
See you around.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You are...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm here to sign up

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for the volunteer activity
on behalf of our club.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I remember that you have few members.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll look for an undemanding job for you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That would be great.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Only

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
moving supplies

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and cleaning the campus are left.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Ah?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Then

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
we'll move supplies.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Isn't that too laborious?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll put you in another club.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No, no.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I can do that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
OK.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can I really do this?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Just do it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The student who's carrying bottles of water,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
can you give us two of them?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sure.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Two, right?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Here you go.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You're welcome.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hey,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
can we have some, too?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes. How many?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Four.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you very much.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Could you take some more here, please?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Did you move

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
all those boxes of bottled water alone?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes, all by myself.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I was about to die for the anniversary.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello, are you Zhao Fanzhou?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I was informed

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that the guest you invited canceled his trip.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The guest canceled his trip?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes. It seems he has something else to do.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sorry about that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay. I've got it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My apologies.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
An outstanding alumnus

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
was gonna give a speech
at the opening of the celebration.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Now he canceled it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
all of a sudden.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What are you going to do?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll see if there's a performance

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that can take its place.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll help you think about it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Help me think about it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wasn't our club

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
going to disband

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for not knowing what to perform?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't underestimate me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I will find you a solution.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
we've finished setting lighting
for the stage.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Those who need to rehearse speeches
will arrive soon.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Come and check.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll go and test the spotlight.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll walk around.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Check if the light can catch up with me.

Zhou Xiao!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What are you two doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No... nothing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We're testing the spotlight.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You came at a good moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You can rehearse now.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You go ahead.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm off.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
♪I like your eyes,
your eyelashes and you. Oh oh.♪

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Xiao,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
stop sighing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The heroine in the TV play I'm watching now

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
chased the hero for eighteen episodes

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and finally they were together.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Then they broke up after one episode.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
But you sigh even more than the heroine.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I sighed because I promised Zhao Fanzhou

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that I would come up
with a performance for him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You care much about Zhao Fanzhou.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What about Cai Yasi?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't mention him.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You asked me to observe him

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and what was my conclusion?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He made me shelter him from attack.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Crazy man.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
By the way,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
today I saw him

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
being super nice to a girl.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
They'll definitely be together.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Cai Yasi has finally grown up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I really can't understand you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't mention him again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Help me think of a performance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Beg me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm begging you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I won't help you even if you beg me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wei.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wei.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Is your club going to perform?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No, we're not.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We're mainly responsible
for registering guests.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can you perform anything?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Help.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I learned a bit...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Enough. That's enough already.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You're the one I want.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That's settled.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You're my superstar.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wei, it's okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Only the four of us are here.
Don't be nervous. Dance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We promise

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that we won't laugh.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't worry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
If you really can't do it,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I can do those setting-up exercises on stage.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Come on. Come on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you ready?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm playing the music.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Three,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
two,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Music.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've seen modest people

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
but I've never seen such a modest one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
My goodness,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've got to record

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
this moving moment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wei,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
teach us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Teach us.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Get dancing. Get dancing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm gonna film you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you filming now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes, yes, yes. Don't worry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This is

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
so fast.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I can always smile
and play a supporting role.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What are you watching?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I want to watch it, too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
An alternative performance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
She's dancing so well.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Send it to me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm gonna magnify it, edit it, and keep it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Go back to your seat

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and I'll send it to you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes, sir.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Send it to me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You can stop seeking a performance
for the opening.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We'll use this one.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sorry.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Move there.

and swing the racket.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The shuttlecock will be so high and far.

Fanzhou, Fanzhou, Fanzhou,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
how could I be so discerning?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Beautiful Lu,

Quick. Get ready for the next performance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Come on.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Put clothes on. Don't catch a cold.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I've known you for years

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
but you're really beautiful today.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Were you astounded by my halo?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That shows you do have some discernment.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm going to the auditorium.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You must

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
give a good speech later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The Badminton Club puts on
a fancy shuttlecock juggling performance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How can she be so beautiful?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Have I been blind for all these years?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's he doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Life is so difficult for our Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Keep doing it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Spray it on your knees.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thanks.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Excellent, Lu!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Let's thank the Badminton Club

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for their wonderful performance.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
As a famous century-old school,
Nanfang University

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
has outstanding students
from various departments.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Now let's applaud

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
the leader of ACM team,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
the champion

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of the 2016 ACM-ICPC, China,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Cai Yasi, who's going to give us a speech.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hello, my dear teachers

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and schoolmates,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm Cai Yasi from the Department
of Computer Science.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's a great honor to stand here

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and speak on behalf of our ACM team.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Cai Yasi.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
ACM

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
is an international contest.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's a great thing

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that such a contest is being held

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
on campus for the first time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
That will truly promote the Olympic Spirit

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
so that more people will take part.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We will aim at the ACM-ICPC

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and try to have
a good professional grounding.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
In order to reach standards
of international training...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Don't move.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Our team requests that every contestant

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
to complete more than two hundred

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
problem solving programs before the contest

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and pass all of the tests

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
on the website of ACM.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
We hope we'll live up to your expectations,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
win the gold medal

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and contribute

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
to Nanfang University again.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Brilliant, Cai Yasi!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Gather sweet blossoms while you may.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Wait not till empty twigs are left.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You'll regret it

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
if Zhou Xiao becomes
another guy's girlfriend.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
But

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
there's something more important
I need to say.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I like you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Say yes. Say yes. Say yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I didn't expect

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao would be the second of us

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
to be in a relationship.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I thought it'd be Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How come it'd be me?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Because I passed presents to you every day

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for your admirers.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Sorry about that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Where would Zhou Xiao
and Cai Yasi have their date?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's their first date. It must be romantic.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Maybe a cafe.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It seems people all like
to have their dates in cafes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It may also be a computer room.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I heard

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
those from the Department
of Computer Science all like

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
to meet their lovers in computer rooms.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I think

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
it should be a secret little forest

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
or a roof.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
If the chemistry is there,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
it'll be an exciting story.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hey, you guys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why are you here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why can't I be here?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Hasn't Cai Yasi confessed his love for you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Didn't you say yes?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Or you said yes but you didn't go on a date?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Or you have had a date?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Impossible.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
She must have been here for a long time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
So what did you do?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Silence.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Listen to me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Cai Yasi was taking advantage of me.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you waiting for me?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Or what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you crazy?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You are crazy.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You make use of me

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
every time you're in love with a girl.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm serious.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Serious?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
When we were
in the first year of high school,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
you liked Liu Renyu of class next door

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and asked me
to pretend to be your girlfriend.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You said

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that could make her jealous.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You also did that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
at our high school's gathering last time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You even went farther this time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You embarrassed me in public.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm no longer the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm no longer the same either.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I learned Taekwondo
during the summer vacation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I like you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Stop saying that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you believe I'll hit you so hard

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that you can't even hold your mouse?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Tsk!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
(The University's Centennial Celebration)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why did you come out?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I needed to make a call.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Just now...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Just now what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Nothing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
See you later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This is eating me up.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I should have stayed in the dormitory.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This is outrageous.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
There's not a single post

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
about me and Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you have no respect
for the badminton star?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Fanzhou,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
have you read posts
on the campus network?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
No.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Let me tell you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Now all posts are
about the sudden confession of love

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of the guy from the Department
of Computer Science.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I couldn't even find a photo

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of me and Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
And you know

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
what the craziest thing is?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Everyone is saying that he's handsome

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and romantic.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
They said

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
if it were themselves,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
they would definitely say yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He was turned down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How did you know?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I guessed.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Are you waiting for me?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Professor...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Or what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm in the hall.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It was too noisy and I couldn't hear you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'll call you when I'm outside.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm no longer the same.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I'm no longer the same either.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I learned Taekwondo
during the summer vacation.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I really like you.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Stop saying that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Do you believe I'll hit you so hard

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that you can't even hold your mouse?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Tsk!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Why did you come out?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I needed to make a call.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Just now...

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Just now what?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Nothing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
See you later.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Fanzhou, Fanzhou.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Fanzhou.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You guessed right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He was turned down.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
He still failed after doing that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It's really hard to win her affections.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Is she

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Lu's roommate?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
She's Lu's roommate, isn't she?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The president of the Detective Club.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You know her, don't you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
This guy's failure proves

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that it's hard to chase girls in that dorm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Never mind. I won't over-think.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I must find

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
a photo of me and Lu.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
(Psychology of love)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
The department informed

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
that you need to go to an ACM training camp

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
for the first stage

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
of confined training.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
It'll last for a week.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You'll mainly get trained
in classic common algorithms.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Type every algorithm

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
on the papers ten to twenty times

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
and simplify the codes yourselves.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Make sure that you can finish

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
typing them within ten to fifteen minutes
after the training.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
How could you decide it just like that?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Can't we have a rest?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Right.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
There's no much training.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Be quiet.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
You shouldn't take that attitude, should you?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What are you thinking about, love master?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Mr. Liu said we were having
a confined training. Did you hear it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Mm.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
I heard it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Good.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
What's good?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Nothing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
(Next Episode)
-I really like you. -What are you doing?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Thank you, anyway.

That's it?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Want to be in a relationship now?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.100
Yes.
