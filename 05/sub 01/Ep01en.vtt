00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.670
I see.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.780
Can I use your restroom?

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.380
The key is over there.
You can go around the building.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.850
Okay. Have your tea.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:05.670
Something is definitely fishy.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.460
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.390
Why are you up? Go back to sleep.
It's all right.

00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.960
What are you eating?
What are you doing here?

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.400
This? I don't know.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.900
Your part-timer made this for me.
It's amazing.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:16.840
You picked a good one.

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:24.810
What?

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.350
What's happening?

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.020
My gosh. Wait.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:31.780
-Hey.
-Enjoy it.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.220
-What's this?
-Thank you.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:36.020
Wait. What's going on?

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:38.790
Sir, I can start tomorrow, right?

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.160
Wait. You know,
I have another interview tomorrow.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.270
I'll call you later.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:52.870
-Oh, no. I feel awful.
-What's going on?

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.670
Why are you crying?

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.150
[Backstreet Rookie]

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.350
Wait. You know,
I have another interview tomorrow.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.020
I'll call you later.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:13.560
-Oh, no. I feel awful.
-What's going on?

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.260
Why are you crying?

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:19.800
The interviewee won't have
any shot at getting the job.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:23.040
I'll end up getting the job.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:32.210
[I should have fired this time bomb then.]

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.690
-Hello.
-This is Jung Saet-byul.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.390
She's the new part-timer
for the graveyard shift?

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.360
She's a temp. She's like an intern.
She's not a regular employee.

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.430
My name is Jung Saet-byul.
I hope you can teach me a lot.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.600
You're pretty just like your pretty name.
So was it Jeung Saet-byul?

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.730
Mom, it's Jung Saet-byul.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:55.200
Exactly. That's what I said. Gosh.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.740
Mom, it's not Jeung Saet-byul.
It's Jung Saet-byul.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.570
That's what I said.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.810
Goodness, you're gorgeous.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.080
Wait, you're not his older sister?
You're really his mother?

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:09.820
I thought you guys were siblings.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.250
I get that often.
People think I'm his sister.

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.490
[-What's her deal?]
-Really?

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.420
[She already knows how to flatter people.
She's only 22.]

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.330
But there's no temp or intern
for positions at convenience stores.

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.400
No. You don't know about this industry.

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:26.830
You're on probation for three months.

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:28.270
Depending on your performance,

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.800
you either get fired
or become a regular employee.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.170
What do I need to do
to become a regular employee?

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.340
Well, it's pretty simple.

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.910
Increasing sales, good customer service,
your attitude,

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.650
cleaning, getting regulars,
facing up products,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.950
organizing the storage, no tabs,
and throwing out expired food.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:44.820
If you don't meet any
of these requirements, you'll be fired.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.020
You get it, right?

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.050
That's really simple.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.820
I'm done with this.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:54.360
Let's see.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.170
First, I'll show you
how to work the cash register, POS.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:01.470
POS stands for point of sales.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.700
So P, O...

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.410
You can't just do that.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.010
Have you worked at a convenience store?

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.050
Yes, briefly.

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:16.750
Briefly? You know
all the cigarette brands, right?

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:17.880
No.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.750
Why not? You're a smoker.

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:20.989
I don't smoke.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:24.260
Hey, you...

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:27.159
Hey.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.500
[Do you think I'll fall for your lies?]

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.170
[You asked me to get cigarettes
three years ago.]

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.540
Why are you staring at me?

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.639
No, it's nothing.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.580
Convenience stores sell
over 2,000 different products.

00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:48.110
And cigarettes are the only ones
customers don't have access to.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.920
Do you understand what that means?

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:52.290
So is this what I do?

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.389
Why are you grabbing my hand?
What are you up to?

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.290
My gosh, you're no fun.
I was just playing.

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:00.960
We just met. Why would you do that?

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:02.630
Is this a joke to you?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.260
Anyway, look at the shelf
and memorize every single one.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:07.770
I'll go stock up the drinks. Got that?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.170
-Yes.
-Memorize all of them.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:13.410
Who does she think she is?

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:40.630
Sir, I'll be back later.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:42.000
She's leaving already?

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.010
Hey, where are you going?
Did you memorize all of them?

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.740
-Mr. Choi.
-What?

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.510
-Aren't you going to take that down?
-What? This?

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.650
Of course, I should take it down
when I officially get a part-timer.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:56.320
You will take it down soon.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.680
-I'll be back tonight.
-Okay.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.260
Hey, the bills are about to fall
from your back pocket.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.430
If they do, I'll keep them.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.500
That's a slick ride.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:27.110
My goodness. Something is fishy.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:28.980
Something feels off.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.260
What a surprise. You're already up.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:46.900

-Bye.
-I cooked.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:06.020
-I had to make a delivery.
-I see.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:09.160
There we go.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.590
Okay then. What can I get for you, sir?

-Yes, what is it?

-Here.
-Okay, let me see.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.030
-Can you exchange this money for me?
-What...

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:24.170
-Oh, okay. Do you want one-dollar bills?
-Yes, ten of them.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.270
Okay, ten one-dollar bills.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.210
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:29.680
No problem. Bye.

[I'm sure I counted the cash
and put it in the machine.]

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:55.430
No one paid in cash after that.

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:59.070
And even if someone did pay in cash,
it still shouldn't be empty.

while I went to receive training.

Mom, are you at the convenience store?

And the second thing on the list
is cigarette. Do you know why?
