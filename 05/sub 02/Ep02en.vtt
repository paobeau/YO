[Backstreet Rookie]

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.590
Yeon-joo, I have to get going.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.320
What? Where?

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.890
-To the convenience store.
-Why?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.790
I have to check on something. It's urgent.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.930
-What is it?
-The part-timer girl.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.860
I thought we were going to work out
the whole night.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.630
I think I've sweated enough.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.430
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.710
I didn't know the part-timer was a girl.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.350
Drink up.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.250
If you mix alcohol, it's bad for you.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.690
Are they serious right now? My gosh, okay.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.760
Is she trying to suck me dry?
She's unbelievable.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.170
I'll put an end to you girls today.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.330
You darn parasites.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.710
Let me get you guys some more beer.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.210
Will that be enough?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.340
You should drink some hard liquor
since it's going to be your last supper.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.890
Mr. Choi?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.460
Why are you here so early?

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.060
My shift isn't over yet.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.030
You're off for good.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.440
You came here to see me
because you missed me?

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.610
I'm here to fire you.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.940
-Girls, say hi to my boss.
-What do you think you're doing?

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.880
-Say hi.
-Don't say hi.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.810
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.920
Why is she asleep all of a sudden?

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.760
Hey, wake up!

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.530
You must've overworked her.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.500
I can't believe that she fell asleep
while drinking.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.870
Nonsense. She didn't overwork herself,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.670
she overdrank herself! You brats.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.270
It has been three years, right?

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010
He has such a great memory!

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.850
Of course, it's hard to forget someone
as beautiful as I am.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.480
I get that a lot. You may sit.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.820
[These brats,]

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.160
[-they never listen to other people.]
-Sit down!

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.320
-Come on.
-No!

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.690
Fine. I'm seated.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.430
I hear that you suspected
Saet-byul of stealing.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.440
My, my! How could you be so awful?

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.910
What an awful boss you are.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.940
Thank you, girls.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.780
No, that was all a misunderstanding.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.250
-Misunderstanding?
-Misunderstanding?

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.150
There was nobody else but her to question.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.290
That's why I made up for that
by cleaning the whole store.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.660
Why are you trying to change the topic?

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.800
What do you think you're doing
at my store?

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.360
You're too loud.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.670
No, I'm not!

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.000
Fine, we'll tell you if you're so curious.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.140
Hold on. I think this is
the perfect timing for more beer.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:41.850
No!

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.120
This is beautiful. Look at this.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.820
What do you want me to do with this?

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.230
You're no use for anything
except for being eye candy.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.930
What? What are you talking about?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.040
You have the alcohol tolerance
of a teenager.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.540
-Yes, of a teenage boy.
-That's why you can't drink.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.710
What are you talking about?
I can drink this.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.010
-You want me to drink this?
-Yes.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.250
-I'm drinking it.
-Okay.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.450
I'm really going to drink it.

Seriously?

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.030
He left me all alone

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.970
to hang out with little girls?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.570

-Really. You can bet your life on it.
-It's true.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.290
Why are you betting my life on this?

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.900
What I mean is that I'm that sure.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.270
Really? Are you sure?

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.940
That was three years ago. She...

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.210
Really? I don't believe this.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.880
This can't be.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.710
Poor girl.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.720
Whatever. Let's just...

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.290
-Let's just drink some more.
-All right.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.420
-Sure.
-You have to chug this down at once.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.960
-Chug it!
-Chug it!

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.170
Look.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.080
These two look like they're meant-to-be.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.540
Meant to be an annoying couple.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.909
Hey! Saet-byul!

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.820
Wake up, Saet-byul!

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.490
-What?
-She's up.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.060
-You saw that, right?
-What happened?

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.300
Mr. Choi! What are you doing here?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800
Did you sleep well, Saet-byul?

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.130
We told him everything,
so you sort it out with him, okay?

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.170
What did you tell him?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.370
We told him everything
about why you're working here

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.440
and all of your plans.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.580
You're welcome.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.750
How could you tell him everything?

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.090
-Look at that.
-Look at that.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.890
You should thank us
for being your wing-women.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.130
So what did he say?

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.659
He said

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.800
-nothing. He fell asleep.
-Just like that.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.500
He's a no from me. He's old and weak.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.040
I think he stinks too.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.240
Hey! What do you mean he stinks?

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.040
Let's go now. Want to take that cab?

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.180
-Where? Sure.
-Is someone in there?

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.450
Sir, please get going!

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.060
Choi Dae-hyun, that man.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.770
My goodness. Here.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.870
How am I going to face him tomorrow?

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.390
That's right.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.120
I applied to work here
so that I can see your face every day.

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.290
I'm going to work hard and become
a real employee,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.500
so you just watch.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.000
You won't regret hiring me.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.870
Good night. I'll come back
to wake you up later.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.880
Don't leave.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.190
Don't leave.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:18.730
Please don't leave.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.470
What's this?
You were pretending to be asleep?

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.909
I guess

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.909
I could stay for a little longer.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.590
Here.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.030
Thank you.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.830
Of course you are.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.400
Sales have spiked since I started working.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.230

Drink this in three portions.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.730

at once.

[-♫ Chug it down ♫]
-What are you talking about?

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.120
Why would I drink with those young girls?

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:13.060
I acted very much like an adult.
I taught them a lesson.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:15.060
I kicked all of them out.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:16.400
I see.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.300
You acted like an adult
and kicked them out.

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:23.040
Yes, I did. They were crying
and making a huge scene.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.670
[-♫ Chug it down ♫]
-They said I was scary

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:29.080
[-♫ Chug it down like a man ♫
-♫ Chug it down like a man ♫]

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:33.680
That should never happen again.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.120
Right. Of course.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:44.060
I should get going.
I should go and fire her.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.290
Bye, Yeon-joo.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.330
-Sweet dreams. Bye.
-Okay.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:49.400
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.170
I should go and fire her.

00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.340
Hi.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.010
-Mom.
-Hey, you're home.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:03.080
Look at this.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.950
Oh, this must be the artwork you bought
at the Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.620
It arrived today.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.880
Congratulations.

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.920
Shouldn't I congratulate you?

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.320
Ms. Yoo, I prepared the tub for your bath.

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.720
-I'll go wash up.
-Okay.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.960
I'm home.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.330
You're back.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.270
Why did you drink?
You don't usually drink.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.940
I had a drink with beef.

00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:37.180
Beef? I guess you must've had a good day.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.680
Hye-su bought us a meal
because she had the highest sales.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.020
-Did you buy a massage chair?
-Yes.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.890
-How long is the installment?
-24 months.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.960
Which card did you use?

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.590
I saw a red credit card
on the dressing table.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.430
-There's always a card.
-Right.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.900
Hey, I want some beef too.

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.600
Right. I'm so envious of you.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:06.940
I'm working so much to the point
where my feet are swollen

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.340
to pay off your credit card debt!

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:14.450
I'm walking around on these puffy feet!

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.350
But you're lounging at home
while doing a cucumber facial massage

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.860
on the massage chair you bought
with a 24-month installment.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.690
I'm so jealous of you, cucumber!

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:27.430
I'm about to die!

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.800
I'm about to die.

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.930
But there are eggs, right?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.400
Do we have eggs at home or not?

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:38.040
Answer me. Answer my question.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.510
Shouldn't you need eggs
to soothe your bruised eyes?

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:42.880
Get up!

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:44.950
Get a refund.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.380
I took off the plastic wrap.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.750
Don't talk back. Get a refund.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.350
My gosh, how did I end up
with such an awful husband?

00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:54.250
What's the point of living like this?

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.860
You're so loud!

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.660
Do it quietly, so I don't hear anything.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:06.100
Oh, merciful Buddha.

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:11.810
[After she started working here,
we're definitely getting]

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.210
[more customers.]

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:16.310
[-The sales went up too.]
-Please come again.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.250
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.010
-Bye.
-We'll come back tomorrow.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.020
It's worth making the trip
all the way here.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.020
Of course, don't you know who I am?

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:29.060
Thanks for bringing me here.
You definitely deserve to be the captain.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.060
It's 1 dollar and 50 cents.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:35.200
My gosh, look how she treats the customer.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.900
-She threw that to the customer.
-Up top!

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.570
-My gosh, she's driving me crazy.
-Come again! See you tomorrow.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.670
Hey, didn't I tell you she's gorgeous?

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:47.970
Hey, she's so pretty.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:58.750
It was because
that was Saet-byul's first kiss.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.320
That kiss?

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.890
She just put her lips on mine.
That was her first kiss?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:08.960
My gosh. Hey, I don't believe you.

00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:11.870
Why did she kiss me?

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.100
Does she even like me?

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.200
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:20.940
That's not true, right?

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.910
We were shocked to see
that she kissed you.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.380
Since we're sharing secrets,
should I let you in on one more secret?

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.650
-Tell him.
-That first kiss

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.920
was her last kiss!

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.650
Then...

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:40.230
Hold on. After that day,
she has never kissed anyone.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.760
There might be cobwebs in her mouth.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:46.900
My gosh.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.670
I am...

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.570
Water...

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.110
Wait.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.380
Mr. Choi!

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.980
No. This isn't it. Get a grip.
Choi Dae-hyun.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.120
You came here today to fire her.

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.190
There were a lot of customers.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.060
And the sales went up.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.400
It was so hard to work by herself
that she almost died.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.000
This means to die?

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:23.600
My gosh, this is such a weird gesture.
Why do I keep doing this?

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:24.940
So this means she almost died?

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.110
Come inside!

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:31.980
Hello. Should I ring it up?

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.510
-Yes. This, please.
-Sure.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.950
-Hold on, my baby.
-It's two dollars.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.650
-Do you need a bag?
-No, I don't.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.450
By the way, this convenience store
is really good.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.360
-Is it your first time here?
-Yes, I just moved here yesterday.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.860
Really? Come often.

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:48.930
I will. I have a big family.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.430
Really?

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.900
What's your name? You're so adorable!

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.170
-It's Frank.
-I see. Prank.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.070
-Frank.
-Prankie.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.970
Prankie.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:02.540
Bring your mom, dad, grandpa, grandma,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.980
and all of your siblings, okay?

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.250
Wait.

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.120
My gosh, so her last kiss wasn't me.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.020
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.430
Mr. Choi.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.230
What's wrong?

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.000
I can see a sense of betrayal
in your eyes.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.700
No. No, that's not true.
What's wrong with my eyes?

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:28.440
Are you the manager here?

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:31.200
Yes. I'm the manager here. Hello.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.840
You're very young and handsome.

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.880
Thank you. You have a beautiful dog.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.580
-Hi.
-Do you want to hug him?

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.790
Wait. This is... Darn dog.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.590
-Darn...
-"Darn dog"?

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:50.860
No.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.160
-That's not what I meant.
-I'm sorry.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.130
-My Frank made a huge mistake.
-Frank...

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.370
I was going to come here a lot
since I moved here.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.100
Seeing how you hate my dog,

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.600
-No. I love...
-I can't ever come back.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.310
No, you can totally come back.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.170
-Bye. I'm leaving.
-Wait. Hold on.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.010
-Ma'am. Frank.
-Gosh.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.780
-You're not a darn dog, my baby.
-I love dogs. I love puppies.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:14.380
Wait, ma'am. Frank.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:15.520
Come on.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.090
Mr. Choi! Come back here!

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:22.190
What do you think you're doing?

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.390
She said she had a big family.
I wanted her to use this store.

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.160
So I even kissed the dog.
What are you doing?

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.730
What's the value
and standard of your kiss?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800
No.

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:34.030
No.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.040
Ms. Jung Saet-byul.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.040
Come here.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.610
Come this way.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.180
-What is it?
-Ms. Jung Saet-byul.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.250
Explain to me about last night, please.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.420
"Please"?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.750
Why are you being so formal?

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.060
Stop it. Do you think this is a joke?

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.730
Please explain.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.960
You're asking me if you made mistakes
because you blacked out, right?

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:04.700
You made a lot of mistakes.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.270
You were awful.
I should buy a new set of eyes.

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:08.770
-They didn't see--
-Hey.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.400
Hey, that's not what I meant.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:14.870
You brought your friends here last night
and drank.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.740
-Didn't I do a good job?
-What do you mean?

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.180
You drank with your friends
during your working hours.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.510
I came here to fire you. Did you get that?

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.980
What? Listen. I helped you increase sales.
Do I deserve to be fired?

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.490
What sales?

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:28.890
My friends bought a lot from the store.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.760
They didn't buy from here. They just ate
whatever they wanted from the store.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:33.960
They paid you.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.560
They didn't pay me. What money?

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:36.860
-In your back pocket.
-What's there?

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.030
-The other pocket.
-What? What is it?

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.270
Hey, what is this? Is this 200 dollars?

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:42.570
Don't you remember?

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.440
You even did the hula dance
for my friends.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.340
And they gave you the change for your tip.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.110
Don't you know the hula dance?

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.710
The hula dance. You did it,
so you must know what it is.

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.650
-Hula dance.
-You mean,

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:00.290
Right now?

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:04.860
Yeon-joo, I don't think
this is a good time.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.160
[Dae-hyun, I'm in a real hurry.]

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:10.000
Okay, I'll be right there.
Yes, of course I should go.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:11.730
I won't take long. Wait right there.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.330
Are you going somewhere?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.670
Something... Something urgent came up.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.640
What is it?

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.540
You don't need to worry about it.

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:20.940
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.780
Is it more urgent than this?

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.850
Yes, I'll be right back.
It won't take long.

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:28.850
Wait for me.
Tell your friends to be careful.

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.450
My gosh.

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:40.660
I want to kill that jerk.

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.070
Hey, you guys can go home.
This is just a waste of time.

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.700
Gosh, go home already!

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.150
Why is she so fickle?

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.620
I bet it all comes from love.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:05.380
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.650

-Yeon-joo!
-Dae-hyun! Hurry!

-Are you okay? What--
-Thank you. I'm glad you're here.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.760
-Are you okay? The car--
-I always think of you when I need help.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.100
Gosh, it's natural for you
to ask me for help.

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.330
What can you ever do without me?

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.740
Stop talking in that tone.
The insurance company will be here soon.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.010
-Oh, okay. I'll use this chance to check--
-Yes, yes.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.170
I'm late. I need to go now.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.510
Right. You're late. Go on.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.210
I know you can't be late.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.480
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.480
-Yeon-joo, good luck.
-I'll call you later.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.460
My gosh, come on.
I don't have time for this right now.

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:52.870
♫ You're so pretty
that you make me go dizzy ♫

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.500
Ms. Gong.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.800
I'm going home now.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.610
Okay, I'm sure you had a long day.

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:02.440
By the way, Ms. Gong, do you smoke?

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.280
No, I hate the smell of cigarettes.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.280
Then why did you kiss the cigarette pack?

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.620
Because this helps us make money.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:15.690
Lots of customers come to buy cigarettes
and end up buying tons of other stuff.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.190
The guy who just left spent 48 dollars
when he actually came here for cigarettes.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.660
I know it's best to tell them to quit.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.660
But it's hard to do that
when I think of the sales.

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:25.300
Making a living is very hard.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.900
I guess cigarettes are really important.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:31.000
Yes, they take up half the sales
of all convenience stores.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.840
Anyway, where in the world is Dae-hyun?

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.280
Why is the manager gone for so long?

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.430
Sir, stop! Stop! Wait!

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.900
You can go ahead without me.
I'll call you.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.470
Hey, don't sell cigarettes to this guy.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:11.040
You came here to buy cigarettes
even after what you did to me?

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:12.910
Gosh, you startled me.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.980
I guess you don't care
because you don't get punished.

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.920
What do you want me to do? That's the law.

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:22.390
Hey, listen. When was the first day
you came to our convenience store?

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.520
Why?

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.360
So you can prove that you asked for my ID?

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.890
Gosh, I don't think I remember.

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.960
I bet you do.

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.670
You came from the precinct and hospital.
You were wearing a bandage.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.270
Unbelievable. If you know so well,
why are you asking me?

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:38.600
Just tell me the exact date
of when you first came.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.940
That's all I need to know.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.710
Why would I do that? Why?

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:43.280
"Why"? "Why"?

00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.510
Hey, you jerk!

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.310
You might think our store is a place
where you buy cigarettes.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.250
But to our family, it's our lifeline.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.690
We bet everything on that store.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:55.450
My mom's money, my dad's health,

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.520
and my entire future.
It holds the future of our entire family!

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.630
I won't let a guy like you
have an effect on our sales.

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.600
The only thing you can't sell
are cigarettes.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.700
Why are you making it sound like
it's such a big deal?

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.070
It's not like your store is shutting down.
You're allowed to sell everything else.

You're a real piece of trash.

the year of the sheep.

it seemed like--

Well, you got it wrong! This is me!

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.560

I see you bought a cigarette.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.610
The manager is so petty.
I can't believe he sent you.

00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:00.110
-Do you know me?
-Of course.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:03.350
I purposely avoided your working hours
to buy cigarettes there.

00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.890
Then you must know
that I'm nothing like the manager.

The store is his family's
source of income,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.290
and his life depends on it.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.490
But I don't have a family,
and I got expelled.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.090
So I have nothing to lose or fear.

doesn't make enough money

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:51.940
And I did, so I'm an official part-timer.
Take this off now.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:55.610
It's official now.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:57.650
-Says who?
-What?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:01.920
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.660
I asked you about it last night,

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:06.790
and you gave a nod like this.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.190
When did I do that? Where? How? Why?

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.460
I don't remember.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:12.930
My gosh, you were sitting here like this.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:16.230
-"Okay, sure."
-What? Unbelievable.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.270
When did I ever say that to you?

00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:22.470
Are you just making things up
because I was sleeping?

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.810
I don't remember saying that.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.580
My gosh, are you serious?

00:51:29.950 --> 00:51:32.780
Okay, fine. I guess I have no choice.

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.690
I'll just give up on being an official...

00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.990
You must think I'm really slow.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:10.820
Saet-byul,
there's something I want to check.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.590
What's that?

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:15.730
Saet-byul, by any chance...

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:18.160
Three...

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.370
["Three"? Three years ago?]

00:52:22.170 --> 00:52:23.570
[When we first met?]

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.970
-"Three"?
-Were you...

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:29.840
No, I mean...

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:32.780
Your...

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:37.720
-Your first...
[-First what? First kiss?]

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.890
[Is he finally going to ask me?]

00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:41.750
"First"? First what?

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:44.790
Well... The first...

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:52.000
The first column.

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.000
The first column
of the third display stand is empty.

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:59.300
I kept telling you that it's empty.
Why haven't you filled it up already?

00:52:59.370 --> 00:53:02.370
When will you officially get hired
by slacking off like that?

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:04.480
You have a long way to go.

00:53:04.810 --> 00:53:07.050
Do I need to explain
every little detail to you?

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.880
Will you please work harder?

00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:09.950
What...

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:14.420
What? I don't...

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.140
I feel like he wanted to talk to me
about what happened three years ago.

00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:35.370
Maybe I should've asked him
more questions.

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:41.180
He wants me to look away?

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.480
[Part-timer Wanted]

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.760
My gosh. You should be thanking me.

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:54.660
-Excuse me.
-Hello. Welcome.

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.700
[I'm worried I might've treated her]

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:04.640
[exactly like how I was treated
in the past.]

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:08.910
[-Dae-hyun!]
-Yes, sir?

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:13.480
Did you write this?

00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:18.680
Is this the best you can do? Is it because
you went to a community college?

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:22.450
This is why I can't ignore
people's educational backgrounds.

00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.190
Sir, I wrote that.

00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:26.790
It was you?

00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:35.030
[-I was too biased to see her]
-Here you go.

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:37.700
[-for whom she really is.]
-Thank you. Bye.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.610
[Hey, Dae-hyun.]

00:54:47.110 --> 00:54:49.380
Yeon-joo, you weren't late
to your meeting, were you?

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:53.220
No, but I would've been late
if it weren't for you.

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:57.120
What a relief. I'll drive your car
back to your office tomorrow.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.560
[Thank you.]

00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.490
There's no need to thank me for this.
By the way, Yeon-joo,

00:55:02.890 --> 00:55:05.060
I have something to tell you.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:06.560
What is it?

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.840
I'm not going to fire the part-timer.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:14.370
What?

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.610
Why not? You seemed so eager to fire her.

00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.650
-I had a misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:23.580
I thought she was reckless,
but I was wrong.

00:55:23.650 --> 00:55:26.690
And I can really use her help
at the convenience store.

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.420
You're being too hasty.

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.390
You promised to think about it
and discuss it with me--

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.490
[Yeon-joo.]

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.530
I know you were my boss
when I used to work in the PR team.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:38.530
But this is
regarding my convenience store.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:42.200
And I've made up my mind as the manager.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.870
So I'd like you to respect my decision.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:45.870
I see.

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.470
Okay then. Do whatever you want.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:55.510
I think she's angry.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.720
Ms. Yoo Yeon-joo.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.550
Hello, sir.

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.820
Why haven't you gone home yet?

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.590
I'm getting ready
for the presentation tomorrow.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:10.860
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?
I haven't eaten either.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:17.740
Yeon-joo.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.070
We're at work, sir.
Please call me Ms. Yoo.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.040
Okay, Ms. Yoo. I apologize.

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:28.680
Is your boyfriend's convenience store
doing well?

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:32.450
It's our franchise,
so I'm sure you know his sales.

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:34.820
So can I ask you why you're asking?

00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:36.520
I'm asking how satisfied he is.

00:56:36.690 --> 00:56:39.660
Our franchises need to be happy
in order for the company to grow.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.660
Let's not talk about someone
who isn't here right now.

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.160
Then should we talk about us?

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:47.030
Yes, let's do that. Let's talk about work.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.300
Did you prepare everything
for tomorrow's presentation, sir?

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:00.050
[I found this among the CCTV footages.]

00:57:00.110 --> 00:57:01.810
[I bet both Eun-jo's and my life]

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:04.150
[that you'll change your mind
once you see this footage.]

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:06.680
What is she saying? What is this?

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:31.840
My gosh, really? Not only is he handsome,
but he even knows how to dance.

00:57:32.410 --> 00:57:37.320
I can't believe this.
Dae-hyun, what can't you do?

00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:29.730
My gosh.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.510
I can't seem to trust her.

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:40.280
What if she's holding a party
with her friends because I'm not there?

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.650
My gosh.

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:45.080
Let's see.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:47.520
Let's see what she's up to.

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.060
My gosh, look at her.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.190
Look at what she's doing
when she should be working right now.

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:00.170
What? She knows how to dance.

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:02.370
Wait a minute.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:04.270
That's my dance.
