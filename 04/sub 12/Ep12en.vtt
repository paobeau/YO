00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:51.985
"Love is All"

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.289
"Episode 12"

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.680
"Zheng Shao Feng
cooks and sends flowers for love"

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.879
Xiao Liu.

00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:00.244
If you finish another cane frog,

00:02:00.345 --> 00:02:03.365
you would be as slim as Cong Shun.

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:08.933
-My stomach hurts.
-It's been a long day. brothers.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:13.425
You got away this time.

00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:17.456
You sound like you want me
to get food poisoning.

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.360
No, I am just thirsty.
I need some water.

00:02:20.461 --> 00:02:21.526
Here, I brought some water.

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:24.427
That's more like it.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.128
What is this? It tastes sour!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.178
This is the chrysanthemum herbal tea
Preceptor Tan prepared.

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.022
It helps to cool the inner heat,
it suits you just well.

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:43.899
Little Dragon! We are supposed to be
brothers in arms!

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.639
You promised to brave
through danger together.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.885
Do you regret it now?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.598
-Clear some space for me!
-It's not that bad!

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.536
-Hurry up!
-I can barely feel my leg.

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.253
-Thank you.
-Xiao Liu.

00:03:03.455 --> 00:03:04.546
You've lost some weight.

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:17.680
It's good for them cleanse
their bodies sometimes.

00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:20.968
I won't cook again.

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:22.682
That's more like it.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.810
But you are still annoying as always.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.849
All the Sang family's
servants are dead.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.410
Why didn't you tell me?

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:36.452
Who told you that?

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.139
The family members came to
get the remaining pension.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.349
I am the only person
who could still work.

00:03:43.296 --> 00:03:44.531
Of course I would know.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.018
I didn't tell you because
what's done is done,

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:49.896
I don't want you to
waste your tears for them.

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:52.050
What about the evidences?

00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:53.951
We lost them.

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.634
What? Shouldn't you
be looking for them?

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.074
The evidence against Sang Jie
weren't very useful anyway.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.592
It doesn't matter if they are lost.

00:04:02.848 --> 00:04:04.849
But the witnesses we need are dead.

00:04:06.047 --> 00:04:08.360
Our lead is completely cut off.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.934
Have you conducted the autopsy?

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.219
Someone must have left some clue
on the body for us to find.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.852
Maybe they are waiting for someone
to bring the murderer to justice.

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:17.735
That's how the story in novel goes.

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.440
Please come in!

00:04:22.686 --> 00:04:23.884
Drink!

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.339
-Drink!
-Cheers!

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.682
Cheers!

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.815
Have a bite. Don't just drink!

00:04:35.948 --> 00:04:37.223
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.978
Why did she pass out?

00:04:41.079 --> 00:04:42.440
-What is going on?
-Are you all right?

00:04:43.109 --> 00:04:45.618
Boss! Miss Ru Yi passed out!

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:46.791
What is going on here?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.283
She passed out.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.698
What happened to her?

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:52.137
She was fine just now.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.038
Is there something wrong with her?

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.286
Stop standing there, get us a doctor!

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.379
Make way!

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.602
Miss Ru Yi?

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.780
Miss Ru Yi?

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.698
Has Miss Ru Yi...

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.760
shown any sign of illness
for the past few days?

00:05:08.885 --> 00:05:10.084
She has been fine.

00:05:13.888 --> 00:05:15.867
What do I do now?

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.061
They committed suicide
by consuming poison.

00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:27.547
We even found a letter on a body.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.779
It says...

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.640
the servants didn't want their master
to be criticized by the people.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.659
Why would someone
defend a corrupted officer?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.578
They were keeping their lips sealed.

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:42.539
It's almost impossible for them
to their own lives.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.177
That clothing clearly doesn't
belong to him.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.108
And look at his hands.

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.539
They looks don't look
like servant's hands.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.002
The skin is so smooth
there is no sign of hard labour.

00:05:51.298 --> 00:05:52.539
You've learnt much.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.077
Do you think the owner
of that clothing is still alive?

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.413
I have a feeling he is.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.178
So there is hope for us after all?

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.418
I found a new lead for the case.

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:04.858
Shouldn't I be rewarded?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.115
I shall reward you...

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:09.268
a day with the corpses here.

00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:13.430
What? I am coming with you.

00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:18.920
-How much for the book?
-Just one book?

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:20.659
I haven't read this volume.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.539
Come on, give me a discount.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.830
I am regular here.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.239
Listen to yourself.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.821
No one bargains with a clinic.

00:06:27.656 --> 00:06:29.319
A discount is better than having none.

00:06:29.799 --> 00:06:30.923
Unbelievable.

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:32.698
Commissioner Zheng, take it.

00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:34.578
Boil it with three bowls of water,
shimmer it for one hour.

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:35.978
-Come again.
-I want my discount!

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.152
I won't be here again!

00:06:40.978 --> 00:06:42.724
-Doctor!
-Aren't you...

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.327
Why do you look so nervous?

00:06:45.359 --> 00:06:47.440
No medicine can heal
your boss' broken heart.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:48.864
You will find no cure here.

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:52.644
It's not my boos. Miss Ru Yi is sick.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.887
She is sick?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.779
Yes! She passed out.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.074
I am here to get her a doctor.

00:06:59.213 --> 00:07:00.616
Why didn't you say that earlier?

00:07:01.014 --> 00:07:02.698
Doctor, come with me. Someone is ill.

00:07:02.799 --> 00:07:03.939
-Hurry up!
-Hurry.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.219
-Hurry.
-Get moving.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.399
-Don't be so hasty.
-Hurry up.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.741
-Hurry up.
-Let's go.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.516
Doctor, what is wrong with her?

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.186
This is odd.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.781
Her pulse is unstable.

00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:24.593
Her blood pressure is too low.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:26.190
It's like she was poisoned,

00:07:26.799 --> 00:07:28.198
yet the poison is not lethal.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:32.154
That's all?

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:35.430
Hold on, we brought you here
to get her treated.

00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:38.638
This is unlike anything
I've seen before.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.840
Is there any sign of
irregularity with her lately?

00:07:42.392 --> 00:07:43.526
Irregularity?

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.082
Bad temper, easily frustrated.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.367
Sudden mood swing.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.620
She doesn't smile or talk much,
she disappears from time to time.

00:07:59.623 --> 00:08:02.022
I mean physical health.

00:08:04.112 --> 00:08:05.911
Physical?

00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:12.460
Why are you staring at me?
How should I know?

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.142
I thought you got what
you wanted with her.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.981
Zhu Da Cong!

00:08:19.079 --> 00:08:21.532
Miss Ru Yi is awake.
You are awake.

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:32.314
What are you doing in here?

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.857
You passed out
during a dance just now.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.119
He is the doctor we brought.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.274
Yes.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.381
I don't need a doctor.
I need you to leave.

00:08:41.935 --> 00:08:44.145
You need to get
treatment for your illness.

00:08:45.543 --> 00:08:48.561
I bet this condition has been
bothering you for some time.

00:08:49.103 --> 00:08:51.039
You find it hard to fall asleep.

00:08:51.582 --> 00:08:54.908
And even in sleep,
you have nightmares.

00:08:55.359 --> 00:08:58.258
You sometimes feel heart burn,
am I right?

00:08:58.359 --> 00:08:59.653
None of your business.

00:08:59.754 --> 00:09:01.028
This is my body.

00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:02.307
I know what is going on.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.595
Why didn't you tell us you are so ill?

00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:09.607
I was born with this disorder.
It can't be cured.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.566
You don't need to be worried.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:14.138
I don't need you to take care of me.

00:09:14.239 --> 00:09:16.299
That can't be right.
The doctor is here.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.219
At least let him give
you some medication.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.099
It might cure you somehow.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.253
Leave.

00:09:21.618 --> 00:09:23.760
-Miss Ru Yi.
-I want you to leave!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.883
Since Miss Ru Yi insists,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.698
perhaps we should leave.

00:09:30.799 --> 00:09:33.520
I think she still needs some rest.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.195
I shall leave first.

00:09:45.152 --> 00:09:46.179
Well,

00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:48.459
take care of yourself.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.919
Here, drink with me.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:01.312
Doctor.

00:10:01.447 --> 00:10:03.652
Is she chronically ill?

00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:07.001
It's not that it's hard to treat,

00:10:07.624 --> 00:10:09.568
but I don't know the cure to it.

00:10:10.359 --> 00:10:12.135
-Furthermore...
-Furthermore what?

00:10:13.248 --> 00:10:16.560
Without some trials on the medication,

00:10:17.064 --> 00:10:19.682
we could only use a small
dosage over a long time.

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.566
A single mistake...

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.005
could end her life.

00:10:28.368 --> 00:10:29.567
It's that bad?

00:10:30.911 --> 00:10:32.061
I must do something.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.953
Since there is still hope for her,
we must figure something out.

00:10:35.359 --> 00:10:37.258
Doctor, just give me the prescription.

00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:38.980
Let me know if you need anything.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.219
If you need human trial,
I can be your test subject.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.834
But that is unethical.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.779
You are perfectly fine, you can't
take medicine for no reason.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.051
Just do as I say!

00:10:49.599 --> 00:10:50.761
Listen closely.

00:10:50.862 --> 00:10:53.526
This is the limited edition
from Miao Miao Sheng.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.374
-Goodbye.
-It's price of one for two copies.

00:10:55.475 --> 00:10:57.405
This is such a great deal.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:59.264
Have a look around.

00:10:59.419 --> 00:11:00.779
Where is my hairpin?

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.539
-Where is the hairpin?
-This is it.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.919
It's right here. Right here.

00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:05.058
Where is it?

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.258
What hairpin?

00:11:06.359 --> 00:11:07.550
You know which hairpin it is.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.760
Did you leave it
at the District Bureau?

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:13.795
I think so.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.561
Miss Ling Yin, you barely
pay attention to appearance.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.519
You don't even mind
being embarrassing.

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:22.200
Why are you so anxious
over a mere hairpin?

00:11:23.498 --> 00:11:26.659
Well, the hairpin is...

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.299
It's quite expensive.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.578
It's a shame to lose it.

00:11:29.679 --> 00:11:31.073
Is this the picture?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.185
Fine, carry on with the work.
I have to go now.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.387
Look, she is actually Miao Miao Sheng.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.595
What is that black stuff?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.170
I am frying dates.

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:01.498
Miss Ru Yi has been having nightmares.

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:03.659
The herbs in sold at the shops
are all too old.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.834
They aren't as effective,
so I am making a new batch.

00:12:08.224 --> 00:12:10.579
She would have recovered
had you stopped bothering her.

00:12:11.578 --> 00:12:12.859
Don't mock me.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.447
Just make things right
with your Preceptor.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.614
Let me ask you something.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.618
What kind of gifts...

00:12:18.719 --> 00:12:20.619
do the girls usually like?

00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:22.269
For the Preceptor?

00:12:24.126 --> 00:12:25.228
You can put it that way.

00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:28.945
She found out one of the servants
might still be alive.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.255
She is asking for a reward.

00:12:30.719 --> 00:12:33.339
She keeps bothering me
so I need to do something.

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.094
Sure, keep making up your stories.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.200
Just get a present for her.

00:12:37.599 --> 00:12:38.941
This is not embarrassing.

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:45.369
Any progress on the investigation
of the mine?

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.872
Cong Shun is digging the site.

00:12:48.039 --> 00:12:49.530
There is nothing much going.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.383
So I am here to get some work done.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.639
Do you even know what is work?

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.739
Cong Shun is almost
done with his task.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.299
I want you to be there at once.

00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:01.346
Why don't you trust our own people?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.424
Which is why I hope
you wouldn't let me down.

00:13:06.719 --> 00:13:08.099
It seems like I have no choice.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.402
There is nothing I can do.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.333
Master Tang, watch the stove for me.

00:13:13.719 --> 00:13:16.117
Lower the heat after one minute.

00:13:16.218 --> 00:13:18.145
Make sure the dates are charred,
then put out the fire.

00:13:18.599 --> 00:13:19.650
And also,

00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:23.060
you need to give her something
she is interested in or useful.

00:13:23.581 --> 00:13:24.607
Is that clear?

00:13:28.823 --> 00:13:30.139
Something she is interested in?

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.075
But this lady we have here...

00:13:33.421 --> 00:13:35.151
is only interested in money.

00:13:37.976 --> 00:13:40.606
I read it from Preceptor Tan's novel.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.657
Flowers are given as a token of love.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.423
But the flowers wither in a few days.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.013
You can't even eat it.

00:13:49.114 --> 00:13:50.357
Why would anyone send flowers?

00:13:51.359 --> 00:13:52.440
What would you know?

00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.660
The meaning is not the flower per Se.

00:13:55.479 --> 00:13:58.640
It's whether the man you love
is willing to surprise you.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.956
Surprise?

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.706
I think sweets are
much better as gifts.

00:14:07.208 --> 00:14:09.329
Is eating the only thing
you care about?

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.821
Flowers are precious.
You can't water it too much.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.277
When the sun is too bright,

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.753
you need to carry it inside.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.015
Otherwise the petals will become dry.

00:14:23.479 --> 00:14:25.275
Flower gets more love
than a human does.

00:14:25.719 --> 00:14:28.618
Who does Master Tang love
these cumbersome things?

00:14:28.719 --> 00:14:31.520
Because he is classy.

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:36.479
That's why he is in love
with Preceptor Tan.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:40.749
We don't know for sure yet.

00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:43.071
Not unless Master Tang says it.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:44.875
Say what?

00:14:47.479 --> 00:14:48.561
Master Tang.

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:51.491
We are talking about you relationship
with Preceptor Tan.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.058
They are rumours you two
are dating each other.

00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:58.817
But I know Master Tang
has his own plan for doing so.

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.825
But the rumours are true.

00:15:04.175 --> 00:15:06.445
I knew it! See?

00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:11.295
What do you even see in her?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.152
She knows nothing
and always causes us trouble.

00:15:15.799 --> 00:15:17.512
Keep gossiping about her...

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.817
then get ready to be sent home
to my mother.

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:26.170
Master Tang, I apologize.

00:15:27.119 --> 00:15:28.698
Which of you said...

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:31.219
sending flowers is part
of the trick from her novel?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.474
I said it.

00:15:32.575 --> 00:15:33.991
According to the novel,

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:36.436
Flowers must be sent
as a token of love.

00:15:36.859 --> 00:15:39.419
A girl could be waiting for
her lover to come home.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.759
And the moment she turns around,

00:15:41.945 --> 00:15:43.018
she is surprised to see...

00:15:43.119 --> 00:15:45.419
her lover is right there for her...

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.663
with flowers in his hands
and a smile on his face.

00:15:49.479 --> 00:15:52.452
Then he spreads his arms
wide open for a hug!

00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:02.539
Look.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.479
-I wish I could have this.
-Master Tang is so romantic.

00:16:04.698 --> 00:16:06.419
-Look at the flowers.
-So romantic.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.498
-It's so romantic.
-Look at the pattern.

00:16:08.599 --> 00:16:10.687
It's been a busy week
for my lover.

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:13.318
I gave you my word
you would have a reward.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.698
This is my gift for you.
Flowers!

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.408
What kind of gift is this?

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.213
No one sends Chrysanthemum to a girl!

00:16:23.967 --> 00:16:25.394
What's wrong with the flower?

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.692
It symbolizes elegance.

00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:30.408
It's far more precious
than the flowers in District Bureau.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.609
Don't you see how beautiful
and special they are?

00:16:35.479 --> 00:16:37.421
So pretty and unique indeed!

00:16:38.359 --> 00:16:41.552
Now would you please
clean up this mess for me?

00:16:41.719 --> 00:16:44.458
People might think
I am holding a funeral.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:45.661
Tan Ling Yin.

00:16:46.018 --> 00:16:47.299
Can't you see my effort?

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.846
I specially and personally...

00:16:49.239 --> 00:16:51.200
-He is standing in the rain.
-Look!

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.520
Are they having an argument?

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.739
Why are they fighting?

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.618
They've only started dating days ago.

00:16:57.719 --> 00:16:59.599
They are having a fight.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.880
The District Bureau is in trouble.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.127
Are these flowers for an apology?

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:07.489
What now?

00:17:08.479 --> 00:17:10.880
Poor thing. Master Tang means well.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.839
-Great!
-That's more like it.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.680
They reconciled!

00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:19.399
This is nice.

00:17:27.239 --> 00:17:30.479
Great!

00:17:31.391 --> 00:17:32.536
I'll be honest with you.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:34.536
No flower in this world...

00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:37.103
can match your beauty.

00:17:41.479 --> 00:17:43.037
This is so sweet!

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.260
"Miao Sheng Parlour"

00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:55.379
Miss Ru Yi.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:58.850
Come, have a drink with me.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.909
Who are you?

00:18:08.415 --> 00:18:09.649
Supernumerary Sun ran away.

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:11.832
He will be back
to side with Tang Fei Long.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.495
Our master wants you to
silence that man.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.640
We had an agreement.

00:18:19.886 --> 00:18:21.205
I am not his hitman.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.479
Our master wants the man
to stay silent.

00:18:25.864 --> 00:18:28.245
Come, have a drink!

00:18:43.599 --> 00:18:46.018
Miss Ru Yi, you need to see this!

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:47.600
Commissioner Zheng chased us out...

00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:49.421
just to make you lunch!

00:18:55.899 --> 00:18:56.986
Commissioner Zheng.

00:18:57.945 --> 00:18:59.087
What are you doing?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.899
I am cooking.
Like the saying goes,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.594
"To win a lady's heart,
you must first conquer her stomach."

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.130
Are you cooking the meat
or the chillies?

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:11.371
Well, I am not sure either.

00:19:11.479 --> 00:19:13.939
Should I fry the meat first...

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.445
or the chillies?

00:19:18.287 --> 00:19:20.514
Forget it, let me do it.

00:19:32.903 --> 00:19:35.745
Miss Ru Yi, I...

00:19:36.479 --> 00:19:37.719
Leave the rest to me.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:39.121
I'll clean the kitchen.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.179
It's all right.
There is a first time for everything.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.018
If you don't want me to mess up,

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:45.955
just leave the cooking
to me next time.

00:19:48.152 --> 00:19:50.379
Then we will both starve?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.664
Here, for you.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.707
This...

00:19:59.179 --> 00:20:00.819
This is has panax tseng in it.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.106
It can improve sleep quality.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.459
Drink this before you sleep,

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:04.736
is that clear?

00:20:17.119 --> 00:20:19.380
Don't bother getting me treated.

00:20:20.847 --> 00:20:23.994
My sickness can't be cured.

00:20:24.864 --> 00:20:26.274
I know I am dying.

00:20:42.104 --> 00:20:44.078
This is delicious.
I will finish them all.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.716
Don't choke yourself.

00:20:57.699 --> 00:20:58.842
Silly.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:07.708
All the bodies found
inside the mine...

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.584
have tattoo marking on them.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:14.778
This is not improvised.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.197
Zong Ying Lin must have planned this.

00:21:17.497 --> 00:21:20.120
Now you are his pain in the neck.

00:21:20.527 --> 00:21:22.723
He might used more
unscrupulous scheme on you.

00:21:23.527 --> 00:21:26.242
Now Preceptor Tan is caught up
in this with you.

00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:35.177
What was that sound?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.719
You broke your own rules!

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.735
I am curious about the case.

00:22:01.935 --> 00:22:03.035
Besides,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.939
I am already in this mess.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.018
I need to know
what danger I am facing.

00:22:07.119 --> 00:22:08.544
Am I right, Commissioner Zheng?

00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:10.978
Well, I am having stomachache.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.983
I need to use the toilet.
I need to go now.

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:15.441
-You startled me.
-You are such a coward.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.149
Right, as you said just now,

00:22:18.265 --> 00:22:21.674
Zong Ying Lin is be responsible for
Supernumerary Sun's and their deaths?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.214
It's just my hypothesis.
I don't have any evidence.

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:34.194
Are you after Sang Jie's gold as well?

00:22:39.848 --> 00:22:41.903
Do I look like a greedy person to you?

00:22:44.479 --> 00:22:46.459
What? They are all looking.

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.699
They are all dead.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.095
What about the agreement?

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:52.182
Don't bring that up.

00:22:52.952 --> 00:22:54.932
You broke the rules and
started investigating.

00:22:56.079 --> 00:22:59.352
I knew you would have your
own agenda for taking part.

00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:02.188
You are a pervert trying to
take advantage of me!

00:23:03.832 --> 00:23:05.429
There is no advantage on you anyway.

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:08.829
I...

00:23:12.062 --> 00:23:14.321
So why did you kiss me?

00:23:14.719 --> 00:23:16.725
You closed your eyes first.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.571
-What?
-Commissioner Zheng.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:20.103
What are you looking at?

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:23.475
Sir, someone has invited you
to have a drink at Miao Sheng Parlour.

00:23:23.576 --> 00:23:25.486
You should go now.
I am leaving too.

00:23:35.134 --> 00:23:36.501
Sit.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.203
Come inside.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.783
Enjoy your tea.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.386
You knew I was alive?

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.270
Your servants...

00:23:57.688 --> 00:23:59.190
wasn't trying to keep it a secret.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:04.244
Look.

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.962
This is a cheque for
5,000 taels of silver.

00:24:10.063 --> 00:24:13.192
Please, accept my kind offer.

00:24:14.439 --> 00:24:15.510
5,000 taels of silver?

00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:18.525
The gold you mined from...

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.179
is worth thousands of times more.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.836
I beg of you.

00:24:21.937 --> 00:24:23.687
Stop investigating the mine.

00:24:23.959 --> 00:24:25.919
-Please, stop the investigation.
-Stand up.

00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:31.940
Sit.

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:35.179
All right, enough chatter.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.421
Tell me where Sang Jie hid the gold.

00:24:38.966 --> 00:24:40.663
I don't know.

00:24:41.239 --> 00:24:42.459
You don't know?

00:24:43.439 --> 00:24:46.049
What about the gold
we found under your manor?

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:50.955
That was merely a portion of
share he gave me.

00:24:51.138 --> 00:24:54.059
If I knew the exact location
of the gold,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.699
would I be on the run
wearing this rag?

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.740
Do you at least know who started
the mine at Tianmu Mountain?

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.410
When? Who? Where?

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:07.217
Sir, please stop questioning me.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.211
I beg of you.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.128
Let's put an end to the investigation.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.773
Haven't you learnt your mistake?

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:29.677
What should I learn?

00:25:30.264 --> 00:25:32.744
I've made is so direct,
don't you get what I mean?

00:25:32.845 --> 00:25:33.983
What do you mean?

00:25:34.119 --> 00:25:36.280
Give me the name of that man,

00:25:36.792 --> 00:25:39.291
I will do everything
within my capability...

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:40.641
to keep you safe.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.406
You will be protected.

00:25:43.992 --> 00:25:45.072
What did you say?

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.099
Miss Ru Yi!

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.456
I've finally found you!

00:26:00.599 --> 00:26:02.847
Zhao Lu is not feeling well today.

00:26:02.959 --> 00:26:04.246
I need you to cover her shift.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:07.179
Boss, I have other matter to tend to.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.098
-I might not make it.
-You have to make it.

00:26:09.202 --> 00:26:11.939
The customers are about
to start a mob.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.579
I need your help,

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.659
otherwise they would tear
down the whole building.

00:26:16.774 --> 00:26:19.149
Miss Ru Yi, please.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.179
I must return to serve my customers.

00:26:27.175 --> 00:26:28.381
You should get ready.

00:26:28.719 --> 00:26:29.933
Sure.

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.474
Er Tong, serve the dishes!

00:26:33.239 --> 00:26:35.209
Yes, Boss!

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:39.895
Er Tong.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.858
Miss Ru Yi, how may I help you?

00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:45.511
Is this meant for Master Tang?

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:46.955
Yes, what's the matter?

00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:50.473
This egg soup seems different.

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:51.909
There are petals on it.

00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:54.819
This is new on the menu.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.293
It's not egg soup,
it's Peach Blossom Soup.

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:00.419
Where is the Boss?

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:01.776
He was just here for me.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.643
The Boss?

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.599
I don't know.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.757
It's all right.
I'll talk to him later.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.634
It was me who found...

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.203
the gold mine at Tianmu Mountain.

00:27:15.599 --> 00:27:18.498
But I had neither the power
or the resources.

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:20.637
No one would take charge of it.

00:27:20.879 --> 00:27:24.817
So I joined hands with Sang Jie
to mine the gold.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.039
He promised to give me
half of the yield.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.459
But after the work was done,

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:32.730
he brushed me off with mere
3,000 taels of silver.

00:27:33.879 --> 00:27:35.444
I was so frustrated.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.741
So I made a move.

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:40.939
Be more specific, how did you do it?

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.800
I bribed his henchman.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.826
He poisoned Sang Jie.

00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:46.249
What poison was it?

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.545
Well...

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:50.016
It's something lethal.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:52.326
Sir, Peach Blossom Soup.

00:27:59.199 --> 00:28:00.362
Er Tong, you may leave now.

00:28:00.535 --> 00:28:02.131
Do not come in without my permission.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.001
Okay.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.059
It's been a long day for you.
Have some soup.

00:28:12.168 --> 00:28:14.668
Great. You have my thanks.

00:28:15.839 --> 00:28:18.171
While you are eating,
tell me what poison was it.

00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:22.640
Sir, it doesn't matter
what poison was used.

00:28:23.265 --> 00:28:26.419
Most importantly,
I admitted my own crime.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.326
I just want to survive.

00:28:29.439 --> 00:28:31.290
Fine, if you won't tell me now,

00:28:31.719 --> 00:28:33.665
you may let me know
when you are in prison.

00:28:34.098 --> 00:28:36.659
Sir, have mercy on me.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.393
Please spare me!

00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:39.813
Sir!

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.931
Sir, have mercy on me.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.414
He is dead.

00:29:08.959 --> 00:29:10.047
Suicide?

00:29:10.247 --> 00:29:12.357
What did you say to him?

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.161
I doubt this is a suicide.

00:29:15.359 --> 00:29:16.534
He didn't have the guts.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.529
The soup is poisoned.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.519
A total of eleven person
were preparing this soup.

00:29:30.179 --> 00:29:31.858
With all the staffs
and customers around,

00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:33.116
the culprit could be anyone.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.299
But I am curious.

00:29:38.408 --> 00:29:41.408
I thought you love having dessert.

00:29:42.374 --> 00:29:45.146
How did you manage
to resist this soup?

00:29:45.663 --> 00:29:48.023
All thanks to Tan Ling Yin's
brain soup.

00:29:48.944 --> 00:29:50.224
Trust me, even now,

00:29:50.359 --> 00:29:52.304
the moment a image of...

00:29:52.405 --> 00:29:54.045
something that resembles
brain tissues...

00:29:55.319 --> 00:29:58.532
But if Preceptor Tan finds out...

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.456
that you dislike her cooking,
I am afraid...

00:30:05.439 --> 00:30:07.811
If you even let her find out,

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.545
You will know the true meaning of...

00:30:12.095 --> 00:30:13.499
fallout.

00:30:15.479 --> 00:30:17.145
Before we have our falling out,

00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:20.823
you and her might already
go on your separate ways.

00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:24.521
The Capital.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:27.357
Physician Yan that is treating
your condition is now in Tongling.

00:30:27.599 --> 00:30:30.478
Your mother wants him
to give you some therapy.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.616
He is already at the main hall.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:35.673
If Preceptor does find out...

00:30:35.774 --> 00:30:37.413
that you are actually Tang Tian Yuan,

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:39.447
do you think...

00:30:41.223 --> 00:30:43.000
Investigate the source of that soup.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.111
To have a Preceptor like yourself
right at his side,

00:30:50.878 --> 00:30:52.434
it's such a blessing.

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.735
While Master Tang isn't here yet,
I need you ask about a person.

00:30:57.319 --> 00:30:59.017
What is his name?

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:01.636
Tang Tian Yuan of the Capital.

00:31:02.479 --> 00:31:04.299
Tang Tian Yuan?

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.068
-Do you know that man?
-Physician Yan.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:09.084
Master Tang.

00:31:10.806 --> 00:31:12.239
-Physician Yan.
-Go on without me.

00:31:12.479 --> 00:31:14.390
I need to catch up with Physician Yan.

00:31:15.079 --> 00:31:18.286
Why? There is no shame
in getting treatment.

00:31:18.387 --> 00:31:20.709
I just wanted to know
if you suffer from any illness.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:22.280
I could also learn new recipes...

00:31:22.399 --> 00:31:24.198
for medication from Physician Yan.

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:26.858
What illness could I have?
Right? Physician Yan?

00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:28.202
Whether you have it or not,

00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:30.623
it all depends on my diagnosis.

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.018
After all, you did...

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.738
I am hungry, prepare some food for me.

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:35.018
But he is still talking.

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:36.738
Go on, I am starving.

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:38.819
-But I am...
-Make me the soup from that day.

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.980
Just go.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.080
Let me know later.

00:31:47.278 --> 00:31:48.301
Master Tang.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.817
This...

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:52.295
As of now,

00:31:52.768 --> 00:31:54.639
I am using "Tang Fei Long"
as my alias.

00:31:55.135 --> 00:31:57.053
She doesn't know I am Tang Tian Yuan.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.933
I see it now.

00:32:00.218 --> 00:32:02.179
I am glad you came in time.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.510
If not, I might have
exposed your cover.

00:32:05.999 --> 00:32:08.965
It would be terrible for me
to ruin your relationship.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.197
But I will tell her my true identity
sooner or later.

00:32:13.782 --> 00:32:15.662
For now, please keep this
a secret for me.

00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:18.599
You can count on me.

00:32:19.319 --> 00:32:22.827
But you must not give up on her.

00:32:23.016 --> 00:32:26.841
There will be a banquet tonight.

00:32:27.086 --> 00:32:28.572
Why don't you stay and join us?

00:32:29.583 --> 00:32:32.579
So today would be my lucky day.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:33.768
Come inside.

00:32:42.278 --> 00:32:44.377
Why was Master Tang so nervous?

00:32:49.886 --> 00:32:50.979
Xue Li.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.146
Let me ask you something.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.268
Is Master Tang...

00:32:57.701 --> 00:32:59.644
suffering from a certain illness?

00:33:01.016 --> 00:33:02.464
Master Tang told you?

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.666
No. I noticed the symptoms.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.605
Just be honest with me,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.354
is it true or not?

00:33:11.968 --> 00:33:14.349
Yes. But Preceptor,

00:33:18.199 --> 00:33:21.659
only you, Xiang Gua and I know.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.837
Zheng Shao Feng knows too.

00:33:24.239 --> 00:33:26.053
You can't let anyone else know.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.294
I knew it!

00:33:28.719 --> 00:33:31.138
That is why Zheng Shao Feng
knew all about...

00:33:31.239 --> 00:33:33.411
the side effect of eating pig's brain.

00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:36.858
His brother is in trouble.

00:33:37.624 --> 00:33:39.535
Don't worry, you can leave it to me.

00:33:45.167 --> 00:33:47.335
What should I leave to you?

00:33:50.439 --> 00:33:52.124
Come, have a drink.

00:33:52.779 --> 00:33:53.779
Master Tang.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.973
He can't drink alcohol.
I will drink in his place.

00:33:56.879 --> 00:33:58.520
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:34:00.952 --> 00:34:03.374
Commissioner Zheng.

00:34:03.952 --> 00:34:05.590
Where is Preceptor Tan?

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.294
I know your worries.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.843
Preceptor Tan is not around today.

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.244
Master Tang prepared
this dinner for you.

00:34:14.979 --> 00:34:16.858
-Master Tang made them?
-Enjoy the meal!

00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:19.604
Eat heartily.

00:34:19.705 --> 00:34:21.165
The food looks delicious.

00:34:22.037 --> 00:34:23.268
This looks nice.

00:34:24.357 --> 00:34:25.420
Delicious.

00:34:27.272 --> 00:34:28.298
Sir.

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.898
I specially made this for you.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.920
The others aren't getting this.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.772
-We don't get that food?
-We are not getting it?

00:34:36.058 --> 00:34:37.098
No.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.412
-Sir.
-This is great.

00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:41.154
Preceptor Tan specially
prepared this for you.

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.931
You must finish it.

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:44.686
Maybe...

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.563
I should share this with you.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:48.019
-No!
-I'll pass!

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.201
-No!
-Only you can have this.

00:34:55.296 --> 00:34:58.487
Don't be paranoid.
The ingredients are all premium.

00:35:00.919 --> 00:35:02.747
I will take care of you
should anything go wrong.

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.800
-That is so sweet.
-I'll try this out.

00:35:06.903 --> 00:35:08.014
Try it out.

00:35:17.551 --> 00:35:18.614
Not bad.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.130
Not bad?

00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:26.272
Is it really so delicious?

00:35:26.399 --> 00:35:27.560
What are the ingredients?

00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:29.854
I can't tell, it feels like...

00:35:30.383 --> 00:35:31.658
this suits me well.

00:35:31.939 --> 00:35:34.019
-It suits you well?
-Let us have a look.

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.536
Let us have a closer look.

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:36.739
I...

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.904
Don't eat it. You are not ill.

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:41.659
This...

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.631
This is walnut and lamb.

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:45.317
And deer antler!

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.330
What is it?

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.098
Eucommia barks, and Chinese yam!

00:35:53.239 --> 00:35:54.351
But...

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.923
this black stuff,

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.782
what is it?

00:35:58.399 --> 00:35:59.491
I have no idea.

00:36:00.199 --> 00:36:01.699
That is barrenwort.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:04.797
This herb is hard to
come by in Tongling.

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:08.888
This is a premium ingredient
to improve male potency!

00:36:11.651 --> 00:36:13.651
So Master Tang has some issues.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.642
Master Tang, you should have asked me.

00:36:15.743 --> 00:36:17.120
-Wait.
-I have a recipe.

00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:19.407
He is facing deficiency.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.555
Stop making fun of him.

00:36:24.144 --> 00:36:25.295
Hold on.

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.935
You two...

00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:31.033
have already made it so far?

00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:34.194
-No!
-I mean...

00:36:34.393 --> 00:36:35.734
This is a misunderstanding.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:37.338
Misunderstanding?

00:36:37.439 --> 00:36:38.787
That condition she said earlier,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.743
I don't have that kind of illness.

00:36:41.844 --> 00:36:43.744
-No?
-Master Tang.

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:46.719
Get the treatment if you are ill.
We are going through this together.

00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:53.380
It's coming.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.239
Wait! What is coming?

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.471
-Master Tang!
-Sir!

00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:58.433
-Master Tang!
-Sir!

00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:03.256
-We still have work to do.
-That's right.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:09.115
Oh no, this is bad.

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:11.659
You got it all wrong, Preceptor Tan.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.418
This is a misunderstanding.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.739
Master Tang was suffering from...

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.802
difficulty with elimination.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.330
What does that mean?

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:27.624
It means constipation.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.490
Sir.

00:37:37.659 --> 00:37:39.499
Physician Yan prepared this for you.

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.644
Don't worry, it will
improve your condition.

00:37:52.399 --> 00:37:53.983
I am not cooking again.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.009
From now on,

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.361
I will never let you step into
the kitchen again.

00:38:00.618 --> 00:38:03.498
There is no outsider here.
Don't be so mushy with me.

00:38:04.869 --> 00:38:06.021
Right.

00:38:07.439 --> 00:38:09.524
That illness they talked about,

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.712
I don't have that.

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.781
Here, drink your medicine.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:27.199
-How does it taste?
-Not bad.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.506
Do you like it a lot?

00:38:30.719 --> 00:38:31.808
Let me try it out.

00:38:35.098 --> 00:38:37.259
-This tastes awful.
-Don't be so greedy.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.818
Why would you drink a medicine?

00:38:38.919 --> 00:38:41.040
You looked like
it's a delicious dessert.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.319
I am not drinking it.

00:38:46.479 --> 00:38:47.772
You can finish it on your own.

00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:50.659
As my Preceptor,

00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:52.854
you can't just give up halfway.

00:38:53.744 --> 00:38:55.246
Fine, let me feed you.

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:21.479
You can't come here
wearing this uniform.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.360
What if someone found out?

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.679
You told me this drug
will only make him lose his voice.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.745
So why was Supernumerary Sun
killed by it?
