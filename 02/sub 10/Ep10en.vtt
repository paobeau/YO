but what if we can't meet again?

That's what I think every day.

72

How can they not recognize you?

73
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:43.020
Because they must be looking at you every day already.

74
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.230
They probably saw that you got gray hairs already.

75
00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:57.060
"Eonni, you have gray hair now." That's what she would say.

76
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:09.960
Ji Yeong and Mother, they would laugh together, and worry together,

77
00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.500
and even discuss what they should do, I'm sure.

78
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.180
I have a mountain of worries

79
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.990
and yet I'm even worrying about the afterworld. I'm sure they will scold me for that.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.740
Yes, a lot.

81
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.170
Perhaps, Seonbae,

82
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:41.550
I don't think I've taken even a single step outside from that day.

83
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.810
But must you come out of it?

84
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:54.240
Perhaps that day is not a day that you must overcome and come away from

85
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:58.180
and not leave.

86
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.160
A deep wound is also a deep longing, after all.

87
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.700
You long for them so much, so it hurts so much. And as you hurt, you long for them even more.

88
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:17.670
It's a problem regarding how you accept it, rather than how you endure it.

89
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.630
So maybe if you keep facing it and looking into it deeply

90
00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:31.370
then maybe someday you may remember your mother and Ji Yeong's face?

91

Was it like that for you, Seonbae?

What are you saying? Why isn't my Ji Yeong there anymore?

163
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:59.220
If you say strange things like that again, I will die by my own hands!

164
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.460
What brings you here?

165
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.880
So you will continue to not go to school?

166
00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.140
I plan to quit.

167
00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:02.570
I understand, but you don't have to quit.

168
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.740
Just take a leave of absence, and once things get sorted out...

169
00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.920
Dad was expelled from his job.

170
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.540
They were investigating bribery related to abuse of power

171
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.920
and during the audit, he confessed everything, I heard.

172
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:24.300
Dad isn't really living anymore. I feel like he is dying.

173
00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:32.390
After just a five minute walk from my house, you can see that department store.

174
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:37.500
Every day the thought that Dad could die at any time occurs to me everyday.

175
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.560
That's why I plan on leaving here.

176
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:50.320
What about Seonbae Jae Hyeon?

177
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.510
With the moments that were pretty as flowers

178
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:29.550
I think I can endure.

179
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:35.220
I'm sorry and  I was grateful, Seonbae.

 I was able to endure because of the moments that we had like blooming flowers. I am sorry and I was thankful, Seonbae

197
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:02.190
I can't find her anywhere.

198
00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.820
She moved away from her home, too.

199
00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.760
I heard she quit school, too.

200
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:17.380
Yeong Woo, she didn't tell you anything, either?

201
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.510
No.

202
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.510
Then what about that friend? She was Ji Soo's closest friend, the engineering major.

203
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.040
Hye Jeong?

204
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.640
Would she also not know, maybe?

205
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.210
Even if it were me, I would understand her not wanting to see anyone right now.

206
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.470
Thinking about Ji Soo does bring tears to my eyes

207
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:46.860
but we should endure the pain together. Why would she disappear? Why?

208
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.010
That naughty wench.

209
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:51.850
Until I have to return to duty,

210
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:54.570
I will continue to look for her.

211
00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.200
But once I return, please continue to look for her, too.

212
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.730
She must be having a very very difficult time alone,

213
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.700
and what if something happens to her...

214
00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.250
I don't think I can live.

215
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.990
I was in my right body and mind,

216
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.520
but I couldn't do a single thing for her.

217
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:32.170
The person who I thought was my whole world was falling apart,

218
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:36.530
but all I could do was to look on from afar.

219
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:42.930
So my life became all heartache and agony...

220
00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.800
Do you understand at all how I feel?

221
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.870
But I always wished her well and prayed for her.

222
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.050
Then I happened to meet her again.

223
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.170
But she's having a difficult time, same as ever.

224
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:08.210
So I felt bad, too, as if I'd returned to the past.

225
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.750
But Dad, you have Mom.

226
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.720
I

227
00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.090
had no choice but to leave, I think.

228
00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.560
After that day...

229
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:42.360
someone who loves, someone who receives love...

230
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.830
such ordinary happiness...

231
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.610
I felt like I had no right to enjoy such things, ever.

232
00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.390
You are so small,

233
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:07.580
yet I just gave you such a huge burden now.

234
00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:15.230
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

235
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.950
Yes?

236
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.330
Hello, this is the nursing home.

237
00:29:43.330 --> 00:29:45.490
You are Mr. Han Jae Hyeon, aren't you?

238
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.040
Yes, what is the matter?

239
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.290
Patient Yoon Hyeong Gu's daughter is not answering her phone.

240
00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:55.830
The patient left the nursing home and he hasn't returned.

241
00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.820
His mother is quite something.

242
00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.640
When it comes to their child, other parents are eager to have it pass and are busy groveling.

243
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.650
This mother doesn't act like that. It's almost hateful.

244
00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:11.730
Actually, she is has that character, enough to behave that way.

245
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:17.390
I did frame the incident as Yeong Min's fault, rather than Joon Seo's.

246
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:20.850
But I am apprehensive about how Yeong Min and his mother will react.

247
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.920
What's the point of their insistence, when there is no evidence?

248
00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.130
That is true.

249
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.540
But if he violates school rules and causes a big problem,

250
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:34.350
isn't it possible to expel that student under the principal's authority?

251
00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:37.330
Ah, yes, that is true, but...

252
00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.740
even if the school violence committee is held, expulsion is the harshest discipline.

253
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:47.310
It's rare for a middle school student to be given that punishment, so I am worried that there will be rumors.

254
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:51.040
So what if there are rumors? They will die down soon.

255
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.970
Are people these days that interested in other people's affairs?

256
00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.810
Of course, they're not interested.

257
00:30:56.810 --> 00:31:00.820
Then I will report to you on any updates regarding how it goes.

258
00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.510
Sure, sure.

3rd crossing Super(market)

260
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.940
You didn't answer your phone.

261
00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.190
I guess I was off this whole time.

262
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:20.390
The nursing home called saying that Father left and hasn't returned.

263
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.180
Do you know where he might be?

264
00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:29.990
It's raining, so I think it would be there.

265
00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:43.630
Why are you doing this again? Breaking my heart.

266
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.890
What if something really happens to you?

267
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.060
Ji Soo,

268
00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.120
It's fortunate that

269
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.920
we found Mom and Ji Yeong, at least.

270
00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.950
They said there are countless people who never even found their family's bodies.

271
00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.290
It's something we should be thankful for.

272
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.570
But still,

273
00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:23.970
I really do miss them a lot.

274
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.200
Dad...

275
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.660
Do you have some time?

276
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:56.510
You said you were curious why I left.

277
00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:06.000
It definitely wasn't your fault

278
00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:10.190
and I knew that so well

279
00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:14.160
but I thought I might come to blame you.

280
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.580
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have left home that day without even looking back.

281
00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.630
Mom and Ji Yeong wouldn't have gone there that day, at that time.

282
00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:29.030
We would have been together that day, and enjoyed a peaceful evening together.

283
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:33.080
It wouldn't have been enough to blame myself, over and over,

284
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.680
so I would have needed someone else to blame.

285
00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:44.010
That would have been you, and after continuing to blame you,

286
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.370
I thought we might come to hate each other.

287
00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.060
We would scratch each other

288
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.790
and it would make us hurt more.

289
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:58.600
But this time, Yeong Min got hurt.

290
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.420
It's definitely not your fault this time, too,

291
00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:04.700
but my heart feels conflicted.

292
00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:09.380
After the last incident, perhaps you didn't have a proper talk with your son.

293
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.520
They say mothers' words are strong,

294
00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:16.800
but a son should fear and be obedient to his father.

295
00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:22.200
After thinking such thoughts, I would beat myself up in my head.

296
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.300
I'm stupidly blaming Seonbae again.

297
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:32.380
25 years ago, and again, now, I'm making the same mistake.

298
00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.380
So Seonbae,

299
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:48.160
our children's hearts and bodies have become hurt, so they need time to heal.

300
00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.430
And we do as well, I think...

301
00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.450
Yes.

302
00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.950
I think you may be right.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.460
Yes, Teacher?

306
00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:59.940
Yes, I understand.

307
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.700
She thinks they will have a school violence committee hearing.

308
00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.950
Mom, are you still feeling sorry towards me?

309
00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:18.530
Yes.

310
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:25.580
Then can you let me do as I want things done?

311
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.680
Yes.

312
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.730
This time no matter what anyone says to you,

313
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.080
make sure to never change your opinion so the committee proceeds, Principal.

314
00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.650
Yes.

315
00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.230
They're doing the school violence committee?

316
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:51.600
Of course. Someone dared to mess with Jang Seo Kyeong's son, not just once but twice.

317
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.550
I really won't stand for it this time.

318
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.420
So what will you do?

319
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.550
I will humiliate him in public and get him expelled from school.

320
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.550
But I hit him, too.

321
00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:10.210
But did you really tell me everything yesterday?

322
00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:11.450
What do you mean?

323
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.320
Did he really just hit you without any reason?

324
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.130
It's not without any reason,

325
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.310
he said I looked down on him and teased him.

326
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.360
That's fine then. Keep eating.

327
00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.460
You can say whatever you need to at the school violence committee, so why must you... ?

328
00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.570
Yeong Min said he had something to tell you.

329
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:48.150
Yeong Min, I plan to hear both of you out fairly.

330
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:52.400
To judge after hearing just one side is bias.

331
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:56.250
I already know that you only believe Joon Seo's words.

332
00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:01.460
What are you saying? When did I only believe Joon Seo?

333
00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.590
I definitely never hit him first.

334
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.540
I was wrong to hit him back out of anger, so I plan to accept my punishment.

335
00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:13.340
So that is why we're holding a school violence committee.

336
00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:16.670
I don't want to accept the punishment given by this school.

337
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:21.120
It's because this school, while I was suffering school violence

338
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.260
did nothing for me.

339
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.280
So I will withdraw from this school.

340
00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.920
Go ahead, cry. You can cry.

341
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.980
I know well how you feel.

342
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.300
It's alright.

343
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.950
So am I now just an elementary school graduate?

344
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:51.360
I'm just a high school graduate. I know you love Mom, but you don't have to copy what I do.

345
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:57.630
But Yeong Min, you could transfer schools. Why did you say you will quit?

346
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:00.780
I thought that would make it all end sooner.

347
00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.350
So you will have less difficulties, Mom.

348
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.830
Don't you hate Mom?

349
00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.750
Why are there rumors about you and Han Joon Seo's dad, of all people? That made me angry.

350
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.750
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

351
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.740
I know it might sound insincere because I say that to you so often.

352
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.250
But I am really sorry.

353
00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:37.950
So what happens now with Joon Seo's dad?

354
00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:45.690
If I tell you that I don't like it, can you stop seeing him?

355
00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.050
Yes?

356
00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.220
That student quit school. Did you coach him into doing that?

357
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.400
He quit school?

358
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.060
So it's his mom's doing, huh?

359
00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:08.060
He quit before he was expelled.

360
00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.960
But isn't that a bit cowardly?

361
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.390
What are you trying to say?

362
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:18.220
I'm just letting you know that the divorce you want isn't easy.

363
00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:24.060
Can you really abandon your beloved child and live while raising someone's else's child?

364
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.330
Dad, do you remember Yeong Min?

365
00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.590
Hello.

366
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.850
It's alright.

367
00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:03.990
It's Saturday, so it would've been nice if Joon Seo's dad could join us.

368
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.170
He even goes to work on Saturdays. You know he doesn't know anything else besides work.

369
00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.430
I didn't mean that in a bad way.

370
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:19.430
I purposely didn't tell him that you were coming, Mother.

371
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:24.180
I wanted to speak with you alone, Mother-in-Law.

372
00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:26.990
Is something going on?

373
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:37.110
Jae Hyeon would die for you because he loves you so much.

374
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.980
So if you tell him that you like me, he might not let me go.

375
00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.770
So something is going on between you two.

376
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:51.220
Please plead with Jae Hyeon, Mother.

377
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.060
When did you come?

378
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.320
And why are you here alone?

379
00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.020
Has something happened?

380
00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.650
What about you, what is happening with you?

381
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:14.560
Joon Seo's mom asked me to help her hold on to you.

382
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:21.720
You told me that you met that girl, so did something really happen after all?

383
00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:27.260
Because I know how you've endured so far in life,

384
00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:33.340
if I'm only thinking about you, it would be right for me to tell you to break up with your wife.

385
00:44:33.340 --> 00:44:39.890
However thinking about your child, I cannot bring myself to utter those words.

386
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.950
What's going on? That you would come to greet me?

387
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:53.220
Did you drink? After inviting my mother to come here?

388
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.430
Well, since I said all I needed to say to her.

389
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:07.110
But seeing your reaction,

390
00:45:07.110 --> 00:45:10.570
looks like using the Mother-in-Law as a saving chance wasn't very effective.

391
00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.660
It's our problem. There isn't anything Mother can do about it.

392
00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:16.440
There's no such thing.

393
00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:20.430
I will do everything. I will grab anyone I can to help me.

394
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:28.010
How regretful that your father died when you were young. I'll bet he would be on my side.

395
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.450
All that's left is for you to make your decision.

396
00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:32.790
I can't decide.

397
00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.480
How can I make such a decision so easily?

398
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:38.490
Nothing was ever easy before.

399
00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:42.340
Because at every single point, you have to put everything at stake.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:06.510
Is she your friend, Yoo Bin?

404
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.400
She is not my friend.

405
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.360
Did you come to take class?

406
00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.870
She doesn't go to this music school.

407
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:17.750
I can play better than you even if I don't attend an academy.

408
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.890
How funny. How can you play if you don't take any classes?

409
00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.900
I can play.

410
00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.370
You don't even have a piano at home.

411
00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.050
But I can still play.

412
00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.320
Then do you want to try playing piano?

413
00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:47.150
Teacher, my mother wants you to come over for dinner.

414
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.690
Alright Yoo Bin, go on home.

415
00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.410
Goodbye.

416
00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:02.440
Byeol, how did you play that? You really never had lessons before?

417
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.950
Then can you play something else?

418
00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:24.780
- Byeol, you really never studied piano before?
 - No.

419
00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:27.250
You can't read music?

420
00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.450
But you just know how to play it after listening to it?

421
00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:32.290
Yes.

422
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.380
Byeol, wouldn't you like to attend the music school?

423
00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.020
Mom says she has no money even if we were to just eat.

424
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.730
If you come at this time, I can just give you lessons.

425
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:44.900
I don't have money to pay you, though.

426
00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.390
I will teach you for free. It's because I want to hear you play.

427
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.120

431
00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:54.670
I know you're very busy, so I'll confirm just a few things and end this.

432
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:58.050
The cause of the suicide from five years ago, of Kwon Hyeok Su, a laborer at Hyung Sung Steel,

433
00:48:58.050 --> 00:49:00.490
was the result of a malignant disolvement of labor by the company.

434
00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:05.160
And that you, Han Jae Hyeon is the center of those events is the claim made by the plaintiff.

435
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:06.340
Do you acknowledge these statements?

436
00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:07.890
That is not true.

437
00:49:07.890 --> 00:49:10.230
Yes, even I view it that way.

438
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.460
The documents submitted by the plaintiff,

439
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.920
aside from the fact that you were the Department Head of the Strategy Committee has no physical basis.

440
00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.680
They're all just speculation and assumptions.

441
00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.980
Destruction of the labor union in violation of the law did occur.

442
00:49:22.450 --> 00:49:23.670
What?

443
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:27.150
What I am saying is that I was not involved,

444
00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:32.780
but destruction of the labor union. That is, I'm not saying that Hyung Sung did not engage in unfair labor practices.

445
00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:37.730
Five years ago, at Hyung Sung Steel, there was a calculated and vicious destruction of the labor union.

446
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:44.160
And regarding Kwon Hyeok Su's death, that event was the direct cause.

447
00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.940
Vice President, what you just told me,

448
00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:51.690
what that means, and what will result from it, do you comprehend it?

449
00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:56.330
I comprehend it well, and I have been well prepared for it.

Are you looking for that old man?

452

For some reason, he isn't around.

453
00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:23.710
It's the notice of the outcome of the suit sent by Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office.

454
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:28.480
No charge, no indictment.

455
00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.450
What does this mean?

456
00:50:31.450 --> 00:50:34.850
That evidence is lacking regarding whether Han Jae Hyeon committed a crime,

457
00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.100
or that what he did cannot be classified as a crime.

458
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.240
So they cannot punish him.

459
00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:43.990
Then what happens now?

460
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:49.080
There are no other legal actions left.

461
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:54.610
He really is a cowardly and scrupulous person.

462
00:50:54.610 --> 00:51:00.470
Aigoo, I pity my Hyeok Su so much. I don't know what to do.

463
00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.810
I cannot live.

464
00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:10.320
I really cannot go on living like this, Mr. Attorney.

465
00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.900
I cannot go on living like this, either.

466
00:51:55.610 --> 00:52:01.050
I know well that you have a lot.

467
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.070
Everyone in this nation knows that.

468
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.750
And because I know well how you came to have them

469
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:12.460
I am telling you that I will never accept anything that you give to me, Chairman.

470
00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:17.030
I heard that you loved your son a lot. But I guess not so much?

471
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:20.050
It is because I am thinking of my child.

472
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.490
And please stop tailing me.

473
00:52:23.490 --> 00:52:27.190
I will report your tailing as illegal surveillance of regular citizens.

474
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:37.490
Your father is bedridden, and I feel bad about your mother and sister.

475
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:41.500
So all that I have, and all the power I have,

476
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.590
I haven't even shown you even as much as a speck of dirt underneath my fingernail.

477
00:52:44.590 --> 00:52:48.620
Sorry about this, but I don't want to see it.

478
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.750
Whether it be a carrot to entice me, or a stick. Please don't do anything.

479
00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.470
Since it's all illegal and all threats.

480
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:22.020
I condemn the murderous corporation Hyeong Seong's misdeeds. Dissolution of labor and character assassination.

481
00:53:22.020 --> 00:53:24.430
Apprehend Han Jae Hyeon immediately.

482
00:53:37.770 --> 00:53:42.360
I will confirm for you, just what Han Jae Hyeon did.

483
00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:48.130
You're keeping a promise you made 25 years ago.

484
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.620
I know, right?

485
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.790
But I don't think it tastes the same as back then.

486
00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:10.740
It was so delicious.

487
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:13.180
We were probably much hungrier, back then.

488
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:14.980
No,

489
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.560
I think it probably changed.

490
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:25.110
Because you changed, Seonbae.

491
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:33.130
I'm glad that you were not indicted today. Still I'm not sure

492
00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:38.670
What is real, and what is right.

493
00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:47.300
And the elder who is protesting by himself in front of your company headquarters, I know him, too.

494
00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.220
I even helped him before, when he was having difficulties.

495
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:59.750
Did what happen to his son really because of you, Seonbae?

496
00:55:00.810 --> 00:55:06.120
It's a long story. To tell you just the conclusion, it's not.

497
00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:10.810
Because of the things I have done, I know it's hard to believe.

498
00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.520
I don't intend to lie even to you.

499
00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:18.300
This incident is like a thorn in side, too.

500
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:23.720
If you wait just a little bit longer, I'll tell you the whole, long story.

501
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.350
Though for now, it will be difficult.

502
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:37.140
[Seonbae Jae Hyeon]

503
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:46.910
Seonbae. I better hear the story after all.

504
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.180
The long story.

505
00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:55.930
This afternoon, Yoon Hyeong Gu's daughter came by. She was quite impudent.

506
00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.560
Different from her father... shall I call it, hot temper?

507
00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:02.590
Maybe malice? Anyway, she has that.

508
00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:07.430
What do I do with a day-old pup that doesn't know to fear the world?

509
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:10.210
I've got so many thoughts in my head.

510
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:14.020
- Chairman.
 - Why are you standing? I said to sit down.

511
00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:20.120
I came to see you because I had something urgent to tell you while investigating Yoon Hyeong Gu.

512
00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.100
What is it?

513
00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.050
The story begins with my father.

514
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:28.650
While I was in the army, I got a call.

515
00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:33.400
That my father committed suicide.

516
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:38.600
That he betrayed his fellow workers who were like family to him

517
00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:44.830
and took bribes to destroy the labor union, a informant, a con man.

518
00:56:46.460 --> 00:56:50.270
He was tormented by the tag of being a mole.

519
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:55.150
Among the labor union leaders who always just called for strikes, he was different.

520
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:57.950
He tried to hear out the company's position, too.

521
00:56:57.950 --> 00:57:01.800
That is why he was perfect to be used for our plans.

522
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.090
Because he was well-liked and respected, things worked out well.

523
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.500
The original labor union was disbanded.

524
00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.560
After that, we negotiated a restructuring with a new labor union...

525
00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.020
Alright, so what happened, anyway?

526
00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.490
He filed charges with the prosecutor's office that we committed labor violations.

527
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.230
So we blocked that, that time.

528
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:21.530
Yes, the prosecutor fixed the case so that we turned the blame for the disbandment of the labor union

529
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:23.740
and the unfair terminations all onto him.

530
00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.070
Thanks to that, the union members who were disbanded.

531
00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:30.640
In true sequence, the fired workers, all of them, filed charges against him.

532
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.430
So all the charges against the company was dismissed

533
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:39.340
and that person was indicted for illegal destruction of a labor union instead.

534
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:45.520
Soon after, he committed suicide.

535
00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:54.220
I confirmed recently that he was Vice President Han Jae Hyeon's father.

536
00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.810
It was the most barren funeral showing in the world.

537
00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:19.240

538
00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.430
♫ <i>We have perhaps, again,</i> ♫

539
00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:30.750
♫ <i>passed by the same place</i> ♫

540
00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.120
and at that time another day

541
00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:41.060
If there was a need to put the word "because of whom" in regards to my father's incident

542
00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.570
it should be because of me.

543
00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:46.590
Yoon Ji Soo's son committed violence against Joon Soo.

544
00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.920
What is it that you want to say?

545
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.000
I don't know how to fight fair.

546
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.420
I will win, by ripping you into pieces.

547
00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:55.760
Let us end this.

548
00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.330
The most painful bone-shattering mistake I made in my life, I don't want to make it again.

549
00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:03.090
Because we have to become happy.

550
00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.040
♫ <i>Just when I think I got over it easily</i> ♫

551
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:08.220
To that time again.
