WEBVTT

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760
Love Is All

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.060
Tang Tianyuan got hurt when protecting his adviser; Lingyin received a hairpin and this is her little joy.
Episode 06

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:00.310
Miss.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.080
We've met in hurry in Mount Tianmu.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.950
I've been worried about you.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.620
Did those brigands bother you after that?

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.530
I've been looking for you for a long time

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.600
And you're here.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.360
I...

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.910
I got it.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.520
Wait, my lord.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.910
We're so sorry that Liu Hong

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.190
couldn't accompany with you.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.320
So we really can't accept this money.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.600
Miss. This lord

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.270
was just drunk a couple of wine here,

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.360
and nothing else.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440
So please don't be mad at him.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.390
And please take care.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.550
Miss.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.440
You...you're not worked in here?

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.720
Each of us has our own way to live.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.670
Whether I work here or not,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.880
I'm just as same kind of person as you.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.000
And I don't know why you're such disappointed.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.880
Miss, I didn't mean it.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.360
Miss.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.360
Are you still not telling the truth?

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.320
Shoot!

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.000
What should I say.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.520
If Magistrate Tang grabs you to check the wound,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.500
you can't argue with that.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.160
I missed something

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.730
as important as the autopsy records.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.000
<i>Landlord Sun</i>

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.470
Shoot.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.470
I...What should I say...

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.600
Wei Zitong is clear now.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.210
You'll be the next questioned by Magistrate Tang.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.030
Sun Bufan, if you still insist not to tell the truth,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.000
don't blame me not to save your family.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.600
Dad. I didn't do it on purpose.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.000
What? You really killed people!

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.600
Dad. I've already done it.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.110
Please save me, dad.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.240
You bastard!

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.470
Dad.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.240
Now you dare to kill people!

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.800
How can you be so stupid!

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.960
Do you need to kill by yourself?

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.550
Stupid!

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.320
You did such dirty things behind me.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.320
When do you wanna hide it from me?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.960
Dad, please don't beat me.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.770
Stop it.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.320
Assistant Zhou.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.390
I only have one son.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440
Please help us.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.600
You gotta save my son.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.200
Assistant. Why don't we put it on those brigands?

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.700
I've already faked Wei Zitong's letter of elopement.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.760
If you put this thing on others,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.950
how can we explain the letter?

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.440
How can I end this up?

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.920
What should we do now, dad?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.000
Do we...have other ways now?

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.760
Where's the incense?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.200
Hold court trial.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.790
Mr. Sun.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.640
Who was such a wise man

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.480
who punched you?

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.320
I accidentally fell down.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.200
Do you know why I wanna

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.040
question you today?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.830
Your honor, is it because

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.880
you have found the murder of Hui?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.350
May I ask

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.510
who is the murder?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.950
Sun Bufan. You imitated Wei Zitong's handwriting

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.510
because you're jealous on him who's your fiancee loved.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.480
So you faked a letter of elopement and asked Qi Hui out,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.160
and killed her.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.510
Do you admit it?

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.790
I was wronged, your honor.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.230
How can I kill

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.110
the woman I love?

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.040
Please find the truth, your honor.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.640
Qi Hui scratched the murderer before she died.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.200
Don't you dare take off

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.070
your clothes in here

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.720
to let us check your neck?

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.670
Of course.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.200
Your honor, there is a scar.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.230
But it's not a scratch.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.000
It's a scald.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.600
Scald?

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.350
Mr. Sun. What happened to your neck?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.720
Assistant Zhou,

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.320
I've been felt unwell recently.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.200
So I have to do moxibustion daily.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.480
Didn't expect my servant can be so stupid.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.440
He accidentally dropped the moxibustion stick

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.110
and...and it burned me.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.040
Your honor, can I go closer

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.110
and check Mr. Sun's neck ?

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.720
Go.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.390
Mr. Sun. Your wound hasn't scabbed over yet.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.230
It's a new one.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.440
Adviser. You're right.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.880
That's a new one. It happened last night.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.320
What a coincidence.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.880
Today, you'll be questioned,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.350
and you got injured yesterday.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:17.200
How can you say it's a coincidence.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.920
You didn't inform me that

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.130
don't do moxibustion in advance.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.550
Right?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.920
Adviser. If your investigation is done,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.270
can I go home now?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.230
Officer Zheng arrived.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.470
Your honor.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:40.110
Mr. Sun.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.040
You can go home now. The court 's retreat.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.160
Thanks, your honor.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.510
Yuhuan is missing?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.480
People said she went out in the midnight

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.200
and never came back

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.510
and nobody saw her.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.390
Yuhuan is missing?

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.760
How is it possible?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:21.640
Why you look at me?

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.000
You...

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.270
You won't think I'm the one who tipped it off?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.759
Say something, you two.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.549
I swear I didn't say it.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.319
I spent the whole day with Magistrate Tang.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.000
How can I have time to do it.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.590
There are 24 hours per day.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.760
You sleep for 8 hours,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.150
and not be with Magistrate Tang.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.350
How could I know where you've been?

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.110
Yes, I can.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.320
I mean I can keep a vigil for Magistrate Tang.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.530
I'm not died and I don't need a vigil.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.670
Then I can't really sleep with you.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.150
Alright. I was just kidding.

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:13.910
It's not possible to doubt our

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.400
naive and cute adviser Tan, right?

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.350
I'm such a reliable person.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.710
We shouldn't wast time to suspect each other here.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:22.910
Just let me check

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.440
whether Liu Hong is also reliable.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.790
Maybe she was wrong.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.760
He can't even distinguish scratch and burn.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.840
It means that Liu Hong might

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.760
be bought by Sun Bufan.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.110
Liu Hong didn't know our plan.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.050
So it can't explain Yuhuan's missing.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.470
So who do you suspect now?

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.320
We can't trust anyone now.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:47.320
We?

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.900
It's "we".

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.200
Just leave me alone.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.440
We'll see when I found Yunhuan.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.910
Yuhuan. You're really here. Stop eating.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.280
How do you know that I'm here?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.880
You really think the one

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.060
behind you can hide you so well?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.520
I followed the Sun's servant who

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.430
deliver food to you here.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.960
I've told you everything I know.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.760
If you don't mind,

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.440
I'm gonna eat. Please leave.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.790
Your lady is died now.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.460
Sun Bufan has plenty of chances to kill you.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.790
Are you so sure he won't kill you?

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.550
I don't know what are you talking about.

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.150
My lady is died. I'm so sad.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.910
It's painful for me to keep staying in Qi Mansion.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.030
That's why I left.

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.290
So you believe the Sun family that much?

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.710
Do you know what kind of person

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.080
will never withdraw a confession?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.520
What?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.400
A died person.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.960
How come?

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.250
It's supposed to be poisoned.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.280
Please leave now.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:34.320
Yuhuan.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:57.840
Careful!

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.030
Go.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:22.520
Hide behind me.

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.760
Go.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.350
Adviser.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.440
Don't come over, adviser.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.100
Take care of this girl and don't get injured.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.760
Shoot. Who sent you here?

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.520
Tang, are you okay?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.710
My lord. Are you okay?

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.470
Get back to the county office.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:00.960
Eat some?

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.030
Sis.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.520
Don't worry. I got the plan.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.200
Qingchen prepared these for you. Want some?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.790
Magistrate Tang, how's him?

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.910
He's fine. Don't worry.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.960
You can live in here these days.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.000
If you need anything, just tell me.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.960
Do you know who wanna kill me?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.710
I think you know that better than me.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:47.590
I just don't get it.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.130
Why you wanna protect that kind of person.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.200
But why would my lady like

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.910
a poor scholar like Wei Zitong?

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:57.790
Yuhuan, you know it's impossible.

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:00.900
Why you're willing to sacrifice for him?

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.780
What about you?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.200
If someone you loved

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.320
is in the vortex,

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.320
are you willing to pull him out?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.740
It's great if I can save him.

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:15.590
If I can't pull him out, I'd rather die with him.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.880
If I were you,

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.590
I'll pull him out even if I died.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.140
You'll be addicted to me if you keep staring me.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.280
You're awake.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.760
Are...Are you okay?

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:28.280
Bring me that medicine.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.700
What happened to your hand?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.230
It's okay. Take care of yourself first.

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:39.970
Let me help you.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.150
Have you found that

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.200
there'll be a lot of trouble

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.760
wherever you appear.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.670
I didn't...

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:51.880
It's all my fault, okay?

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.280
Really? Tell me what you did wrong.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.280
I didn't mean to it.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.350
It's okay. Not a big deal.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.759
I cooked you something delicious.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.400
Pig's ear cooked by Tan Lingyin.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.800
Only one for you.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.280
You'll get better after finished it.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:24.920
You ask a patient to eat pig's ear?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.240
It's good that someone cooked for you.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.040
I don't even cook for myself.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.590
Is it good?

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.070
It's good.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:41.160
One more.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.800
Right.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.440
I'm gonna tell you something.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.110
Yuhuan decided to testify?

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.110
Why you always know everything?

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.790
Brother Zhou. How do you have time here today?

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.190
I'm going out for an exercise.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.560
You...

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.360
Doing some sports.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.900
Stop taking off your clothes.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.130
I have something to tell you.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.560
Okay. What is it?

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.650
I think Yuhuan is not as simple as she looks like.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.040
Maybe she's the manipulator behind.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.520
What do you mean?

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.430
Perhaps she had been jealous of her lady,

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.950
so she killed her lady.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:28.160
She's failed to set up Wei Zitong,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.590
so she put all the thing on Sun Bufan,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.230
and tried to escape.

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.680
So you mean...

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.040
Yuhuan hired killers to assassinate Tan Lingyin.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.590
What will she get from it?

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.160
Because she knew that

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.430
you will save Tan Lingyin

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:46.070
so that she can kill you all.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.470
How can a little maid

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.470
has such power to do it.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.350
Women's power is never in the fight.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.560
That does make sense.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.160
But why you tell me this?

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.800
I heard you found the assassin's weapon.

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:12.880
Maybe we can follow the clue

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.520
and get Yuhuan.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.230
You mean this?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.460
This is the needle that the county office used to test for poison.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.470
It's okay. Don't worry.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.110
Yuhuan is safe now.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.070
They'll protect her in daytime, and I'll guard in the night.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.000
Today, since you're here,

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:44.880
help me to stretch my arms.

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:55.040
She's safe? Where is she now?

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.430
You need to do it in this way.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.710
You!

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.560
What's in your hand?

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.500
What do you think this is?

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.920
The weapon to kill you?

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.880
Now the murder has dared to

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.110
hurt the county officials.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.040
We'll have to be

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.230
more careful from now on.

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.230
This is the needle used to test for poison.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.470
It's as same as the one adviser took today.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.000
Have a look.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.920
That's true. Here.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.520
I've already told the officers to take some.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.600
I bring some to you here.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280
No need for me.

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.310
Leave this kind of things to adviser Tan.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.070
She's a foodie, so she's easier to get poisoned.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.520
There's another way to use this.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.830
Why are you stabbing me?

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.230
It might hurt a bit.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.400
You seemed not feel well

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.480
while you practice today.

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.310
This can help.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.400
Brother Zhou. Didn't expect you have such skill.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.560
I learned it from my father in childhood.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:09.190
Your arms will be a little sore these days.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.160
And you can't take the sword.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.240
You'll be fine in a few days.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.000
My lord. We're lost. What should we do?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.400
From Ji Nan to here,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.640
we've been walked for over a month.

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.640
It shouldn't be far.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.160
In the letter she sent to her father,

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.040
she's in Tongling.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.230
Why she put herself so hard?

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:32.520
Ji Nan is such a good place.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.070
But she'd rather come to this deserted place.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.560
I'm so starving.
<i>Zhu Dacong
Magistrate of Ji Nan's Son</i>

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:37.860
I'm starving as well, my lord.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.590
Well.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.830
Why you're still here?

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:47.920
Find the way.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.760
Go. Go.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:49.520
Go. Go.

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:50.680
Go.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.310
Tell me.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.040
How can my wife suffer these?

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.950
I wish I had married her earlier.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:01.350
I'm so regretted.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.110
I shouldn't allow her to run around.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.160
Yes.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.950
Did... did she become immortal?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.310
Everyday I put in some fresh ice

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.230
to keep the body from decay.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.520
Yet it's not a long-term solution.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.310
Didn't we do autopsy before?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.190
The autopsy last time was not complete.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.800
You interrupted in.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.040
So what should we do this time?

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.160
What can't be seen at first autopsy

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800
will show up over time.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.590
There is congestion on her back

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:43.310
and the back

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.000
of her neck and legs.

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.760
This means that after her death,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.160
her body was moved.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:50.830
Congestion subsided,

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800
it means she didn't die after being stabbed,

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.190
but crawled on the ground for a while.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.230
At last she lost too much blood and died.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.280
So in my opinion,

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.400
if we open her mouth this time

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.560
there should be an unexpected gain.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.350
Night pearl?

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:10.040
This is jadeite.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.560
Your Honor,

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.350
when will you catch

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.000
the murderer who killed my daughter?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.640
If I were you,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.350
I would catch Wei Zitong and behead him directly,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.640
this will end the case.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.160
Who told you that Wei Zitong is the killer?

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.280
He.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.640
Who are you pointing at?

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.680
Isn't Mr. Tang trying to solve the case?

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:42.280
Bring them up.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.830
Yuhuan, say what you want.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.190
Your Honor.

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:00.350
When Sun Bufan and my lady got engaged,

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.760
my lady was so resistant,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.350
which made Sun Bufan resentful,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.400
he asked me to steal the letters

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.830
of my lady and Wei Zitong.

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:09.710
What are you talking about?

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:11.190
He intimated Wei Zitong's handwriting

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.470
and let me send a letter to my lady, asked her to elope.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:17.520
This is slandering.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.680
She's making things up.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.040
She covets my son.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.430
Everybody,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.350
this is the purse she gave to my son

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.800
as a love token.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.430
Look, there are five colored lines in it.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.160
That's it.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:34.800
Your Honor,

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.400
I was blind enough back then.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.190
You're talking nonsense

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:44.760
because you want to get yourself off.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:47.520
Your Honor,

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:49.800
I'm also responsible for my lady's death,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.830
I never ask for exoneration,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.520
I just want the culprit get a death penalty.

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.880
Please show us the justice.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.710
Your Honor,

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.590
even if I was being jealous

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.560
and let Yuhuan steal the letters,

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.830
who can prove that I'm the murderer?

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.280
He's right.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:14.880
I guess you would never admit it yourself.

00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:16.560
Summon Miaomiaosheng.

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.000
Master Sun.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.520
What's the matter with our adviser today?

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:36.590
I'm not the adviser. I'm Miaomiaosheng.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:37.950
Miao...

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.800
That day when you heard about

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.830
the affair between Qi Hui and her lover,

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.040
then you had a evil idea.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.640
You imitated Wei Zitong's handwriting,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.040
let Yuhuan send it a fake letter

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.520
to Qi Hui and asked her to elope.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:53.350
After Qi Hui found out it's you, she was ashamed and angry,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.350
you two had a quarrel.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.880
And he even sexually harassed her at that time.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.160
As Qi Hui resisted it strongly,

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.880
she accidentally scratched your neck,

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.350
then you killed her in a fit of rage.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.760
Adviser Tan,

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.760
If Qi Hui really was lacking in women virtues,

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:09.880
and eloped with others in the middle of the night.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.430
What's that to do with me?

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:13.710
He's right.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.520
Why it must be me who killed her?

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.470
Sun Bufan, why don't you think about it,

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.160
why did Qi Hui dislike you

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:22.070
and like others?

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.590
You live a life of idleness and dissipation.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:25.590
Which woman

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:26.920
needs such a husband like you?

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:31.430
I must say, you're too shallow.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.110
There are so people in the world

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.430
chasing after those who are rich and in power.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.520
Right.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.280
But I think Qi Hui was not that kind of woman.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.310
That's why I fell for her.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.800
However,

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.560
she fell in love with that poor scholar.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.070
Mr. Sun, you do have a silver tongue.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.680
Yuhuan is just a little girl,

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.800
she's easy to cheat.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.710
While Qi Hui is smart,

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.830
she would rather run away for a lifetime

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:03.760
than to be wronged by you.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.110
Nonsense.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.830
I'm the young master of family Sun,

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.400
how can people be wronged with me?

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.310
That's it.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.950
Look how witty you've become,

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.710
as I see,

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.880
you're just trying to attract my attention.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.190
Mr. Sun.

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:23.310
He's so confident.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.520
How can you be so confident?

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.800
If you didn't break the law,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.470
you should have a competition with our Magistrate Tang

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.400
over narcissism.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.160
Adviser Tan.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.110
Oh no.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.190
How can you compare with our Mr. Sun?

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.590
I can't tell what you're talking about.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:42.230
And,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.000
I believe in Sun.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Of course.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.760
Sun Bufan,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.430
do you think you did it perfectly?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.880
But actually, you've missed one point,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.760
you think you strangled Qi Hui to death,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.040
but the truth is she wasn't dead by then.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.470
Sir, I don't understand what you're talking about.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.070
When you carried her to Mount Tianmu,

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.520
did you notice that she woke up halfway?

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:14.520
But she knew that this time she would die,

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.160
so she did one thing

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.710
to let us know who is the murderer.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:21.950
Officer Zheng, bring the evidence.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.920
Sun Bufan.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.800
Can I see your belt?

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.230
Don't move.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:48.110
Well, Your Honor.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.830
this kind of jadeite can be seen everywhere,

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.400
this belt is not customized,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.800
it's everywhere in the market.

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:54.680
No, father-in-law.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.280
This... this...

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.160
My lord, it's exactly the same.

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:07.920
Your Honor, this kind of jadeite is everywhere.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.880
It can prove nothing.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.920
But this is found in Qi Hui's mouth.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.520
She hid it under her tongue.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.800
Your Honor.

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.310
Please spare us.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.710
He's the only son of family Sun.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.560
And I have him at an old age,

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.800
it's me who didn't educate him well.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.640
Punish me if you must.

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:36.110
Please spare his life.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.710
You old bastard.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.190
You deceived me!

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.230
Give my daughter back!

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.160
Master, master.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.560
Stop it, master.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.000
Release me.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.400
Master.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:48.310
Imprudence.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.920
What the hell.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.470
Only your son's life counts,

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.280
the life of other's daughter doesn't count?

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.680
Sun Bufan, cheated the young girl

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.000
and killed her. He's sentenced

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:05.230
to jail waiting for beheading.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.880
The court 's retreat.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.560
You brought us justice, Your honor.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.040
Well done. Your honor.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.310
He foretells like a prophet.

00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:16.000
So wise.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.470
Bravo.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:19.830
Your honor.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.560
Adviser, I'll guard outside.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.280
Adviser.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.920
This jade pendant is worth twelve tales of gold.

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.350
Could you bring a message to my dad?

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.800
Mr. Sun.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.430
I'm the one who wants you to be convicted the most.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.640
How dare you try this on me?

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.000
It's not like that, adviser.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.160
I'm already like this,

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.640
you should have vented your anger, right?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.070
It is a benefit, why refuse it?

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.560
The jail is also territory of County Office.

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.590
Put it back.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.590
Otherwise I'll tell lord Tang

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:06.710
and let him double your guilty.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.070
Don't... don't.

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.230
No need. No need.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:11.950
How about this, adviser,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.880
I let you keep it anyway.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.190
As a meeting gift.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.710
Don't call for people.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:17.230
Anyone?

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:17.590
Don't.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.760
Tan Lingyin!

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.760
Well...

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.760
Why acting like you're pure and lofty?

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.230
You despise my thing

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.430
just because you're holding

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:28.760
the golden Sang Jie dug out secretly.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.070
One day you must fall over.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.560
What are you talking about?

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.070
Enough.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.560
Enough. Stop pretending.

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:40.560
In order to get the gold,

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.800
Sang Jie expelled the refugees and blocked the mountain,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.950
he even lost his own life.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.470
And now all the benefits

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:48.430
are taken by you.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.470
I will let my dad report your illegal mining.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.680
Illegal mining?

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.280
Refugees? Blocking the mountain?

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.040
What?

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.560
What's wrong?

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.070
My lord.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:05.520
Tan Lingyin.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.400
Tan Lingyin, come back here!

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.520
Why is she so stubborn? Adviser Tan!

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.160
Is this really what he said?

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.760
Of course.

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.760
The death of Sang Jie,

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.830
the account books of Zhang Zhiyuan,

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:20.520
and the gold in Qi Hui's purse.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.520
They all lead to one thing.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:28.350
It seems that the Sun Family also shares a part of it.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.110
It's even better.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:34.070
At least we know for what did Sang Jie die.

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.310
Do you think it is because the distribution is uneven

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.190
that he got killed?

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.350
Why they mined illegally,

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.950
who distributed them,

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.160
where is the gold now?

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.560
Well... They need to be solved one by one.

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:52.880
How anxious you are.

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.760
You're quite active now.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.800
A case was just solved,

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.190
and you brought another out.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.760
Yes, I am.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.190
A pay rise, please?

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.710
What's this?

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.950
An exhibit?

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.640
It's for living people, for you.

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:23.710
Really?

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.110
You're generous.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.760
I just asked for a pay rise and here it is.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.280
It is because you're useless.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.000
The last time we went to Yichun Club,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.070
when you saw the hairpin of Liuhong,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:38.560
you almost drooled.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.880
Wear it from now on,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.190
don't make me awkward in public.

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:47.920
Is it pure gold?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.640
The inner is copper.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:52.280
Gold plated copper?

00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:54.640
Are you short of money?

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:57.160
It's not what we should concern about now,

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.190
now the problem is

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:00.680
how should we get back?

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.590
Thanks to you,

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:09.190
we can only walk back by moonlight tonight.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.560
It's dark and windy this night

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.320
I... I...

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:22.869
I know a beautiful woman like me

00:34:23.389 --> 00:34:24.839
is addicting.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.280
But you're my lord,

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.630
my lord

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:29.710
will protect me.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.040
Addicting?

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:34.910
Who gives you confidence to say it?

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.280
My brother.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.870
My brother always say that I'm exceedingly beautiful.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.040
Your brother is young and inexperienced,

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.360
he's seen little girls.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.840
I don't want to talk with you.

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:51.709
What are you doing?

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:09.280
Let's go.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:25.040
We can't do this.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.560
Please, let us see Miaomiaosheng.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.320
We really can't.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.120
Please, just for once.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.320
Don't hurt them.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.080
Bring it to me.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.910
It's clear that Miaomiaosheng is not the murderer.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:35.670
Are you OK?

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.390
Sister, they're not here to make trouble.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.230
They're not making trouble?

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:45.000
We're here to apologize.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.150
Mr. Tang has announced the truth to the whole county.

00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:49.430
It turned out that the Sun family was trying to distract people

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.020
and deliberately called up everyone

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.340
to denounce the Gutang Bookstore

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.560
We all blamed Mr. Miao wrongly.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:55.080
Manager,

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.600
can we meet Mr. Miao?

00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:59.840
We want to apologize to him face to face.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.870
No need.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.190
It's enough as long as you know the truth.

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.950
Just continue to support Mr. Miao's novels.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:12.040
No way.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.840
Though we're Mr. Miao's loyal readers,

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.600
we easily got incited.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.040
We feel so sorry.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.630
We have to apologize in person.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:20.150
Yes.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.840
In fact, Mr. Miao never went out to travel.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:29.600
He's always in Tongling.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.430
Where is he?

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.360
Mr. Miao is me.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:37.470
Tan Lingyin.

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.560
What?

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.280
Mr. Miao is a woman?

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:44.950
Those novels are written by a women?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.670
In this world,

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.360
it's not easy for a woman to make a career,

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.080
it's the same for me.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.630
That's why I deceived you.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.360
I'm sorry.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.520
She's trying very hard

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:00.630
to write better stories for you.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.840
She's been to cemeteries and wilderness,

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:06.230
brothels, taverns, corrals and tile houses.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.230
The last places a woman should go,

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.950
she's been in there.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.840
What for?

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.870
You, the readers.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:12.430
Really?

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.910
She wants to write you extraordinary story.

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.470
Zhuang.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:17.560
Moreover,

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.040
look at the frostbite on Lingyin's hand.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:21.080
This...

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.320
This... this...

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.000
It's just gone.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.360
It's all frostbitten in winter.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.320
Fang.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:34.280
What did you say?

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:37.120
No matter Mr. Miao

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.560
is a man or a woman.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.560
What we love is the stories.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.800
Really?

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.950
I will book now

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.560
the upcoming volumes of Tang Feilong investigation stories.

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:50.230
No matter how much Mr. Miao writes, I want them all.

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:51.390
Me too.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:53.230
Thank you.

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.430
We've received your kindness.

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.430
It's late.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.470
Please go back to rest early.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:00.230
We'll open tomorrow.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:01.150
You must come.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.630
Yes.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:04.280
Goodbye, Mr. Miao.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.080
I didn't expect that Mr. Miao is our adviser.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.230
Awesome.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:12.120
Yes.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.760
I must tell my mother when I go back,

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.190
and I'll tell all people in Tongling.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.230
Miaomiaosheng is the most talented woman in the world.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.280
Two smart kids.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.150
I didn't treat you well in vain.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:24.710
Sister,

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:26.910
your hairpin is beautiful.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.190
Is it worth a lot of money?

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:32.560
Worthless.

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.800
That cheapskate is not willing to spend money.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.600
The inner is copper.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.710
It's gold plated copper.

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:40.390
Then this is exquisite.

00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:42.520
It's called Seven-treasure One Heart (copper heart) Hairpin.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.190
Wrapping the copper heart with gold.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.760
The meaning behind it is

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.190
"Being of one heart".

00:38:52.120 --> 00:38:53.670
Whatever you say.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.840
Sister Lingyin must be dating.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.710
Sure.

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.800
She must be in love.

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.150
And she doesn't want to share it with us.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.670
What to hide?
