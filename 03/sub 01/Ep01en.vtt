Yes, by that time, the 2010 Vancouver Olympics—

One month ago. Oh, it's about time for it.

My period cramps have gotten severe recently.

In the last month, it has been really painful to the point of making me faint.

45

I was even carried to the emergency room.

I was working day and night.

48

I don't really have much time today either, so could I just get a prescription for some painkillers,

49
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.870
and check my AMH levels. A blood test is sufficient, right?

50
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.940
We can find out your blood hormone concentration, the age of your ovaries, and the amount of eggs you have left.

Pregnancy is more urgent than marriage at my age. I'm going to keep my eggs frozen.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.400
You're forcing me to come back when I'm not done having fun yet.

159
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.980
Hey. You've had lots of fun for three years.

160
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.200
The photo shoot offer is with a top star. Are you letting it go?

161
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.940
Yes. I will.

162
00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.240
- Why? 
 - You're tempting me to do it, so I won't.

163
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.400
It's not like you're going through puberty.

164
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.830
I'm even helping you move, so what's with you?

165
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.480
It's burdensome so please put that down.

166
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.450
To get your approval, I'm kissing up to you like this.

167
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.050
So just sign the contract. Are you going to?

168
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.990
No.

169
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.070
<i>You have time to run a marathon but not answer my calls.</i>

170
00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.800
<i>You have time to fly but none to meet me.</i>

171
00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:01.590
<i>You have time to go to amusement parks but can't call me.</i>

172
00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:05.530
<i>It seems that you have time to embroider but no time to meet me.</i>

173
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.760
Oh!

174
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.760
Aunt!

175
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.000
I responded to the word "Aunt."

176
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.570
Did he just call you "aunt?"

177
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.560
He said I'm the same age as his youngest aunt.

178
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.120
How crazy. It's not even a restaurant "aunt."

179
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.820
Why aren't you doing anything, do something!

180
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.380
How can I? When I did it to myself?

181
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:38.220
I couldn't change my words after I got sober. He'll stop if he has common sense.

182
00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:42.060
Did you come from an interview? I was at a business meeting.

183
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.020
I go to meetings alone these days.

184
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.650
I'm proud of you.

185
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:55.480
- What's wrong? 
 - Cramps.

186
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.870
Since I was ten years old, I did errands for my mom when she had her period.

187
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.130
My mom said a period isn't anything embarrassing. It's natural.

188
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.160
Does it hurt a lot?

189
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.800
It's okay, I'll do it.

190
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.490
Excuse me, we have someone with period cramps. Sorry, please let us on.

191
00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:19.150
Careful, careful.

192
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.020
Sorry, she has period cramps.

193
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.740
We'll go on first, excuse me.

194
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.490
Careful, careful.

195
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.010
Are you okay? Are you in a lot of pain?

196
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:34.920
Lift your head. Are you okay?

197
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.160
What should we do?

198
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.960
Aunt, it's here!

199
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.080
Aunt, now's the time. We have to go!

200
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.970
We have to go, sorry!

201
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.540
Hold on just a moment.

202
00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.620
What did my mom say?

203
00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.230
My mom said it hurt a lot.

204
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:56.880
Just endure it for a bit, Deputy Head. What do you do for menstrual cramps?

205
00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.160
- Oh, Aunt. We're here. 
 - Move!

206
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.540
So that's how much pain she's in.

207
00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.590
Do you know her?

208
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.480
Ah. She's Deputy Head Jang Hari of "the baby."

209
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.690
He really can't take a hint.

210
00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:31.150
He's going to call Senior an aunt forever.

What is this? Herbal medicine can treat infertility?

215
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.230
Did they say to write it like this?

216
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.980
Director Go asked for it to be emphasized because a herbal medicine treatment patent will be made.

217
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.860
Still, how can you just write down what they asked you to?

218
00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.710
Let's not get sued. We're already a nuisance at this company as it is.

219
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:19.370
Then what should I do? It's the advertisement team's page.

220
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.890
I can't fight them because I'm a softie.

You scared me.

What is it? Why are you calling me so scarily?

226
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.950
Does Director Go's ad have to be put out like this?

227
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.470
It's written well. It has an amazing result for infertile treatment.

228
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.450
That's how they wanted it written.

229
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.700
You're doing this again just because it's not under your name.

230
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:16.780
If a complaint comes in, the journalist who writes the article and puts her name on the line will be the one responsible.

231
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.320
Seriously, why are you so inflexible?

232
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.780
We barely got that advertisement after I convinced them when they wanted to stop investment.

233
00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.220
Please cooperate.

234
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.590
Although there are people who will see this and know it's an advertisement,

235
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.940
there are also readers who believe it.

236
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:37.200
In addition, it's infertility so imagine how desperate they would be.

237
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.350
If this is all fake, will you take responsibility?

238
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.480
Why would I take responsibility?

239
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.260
So I'll take responsibility and not publish it.

240
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.890
I really didn't want to do this but

241
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.560
since we're losing advertising money, unfortunately, I have to report this.

242
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.430
Okay, go ahead.

243
00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.600
Yes?

244
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.800
- Deputy Manager Jang is removing the ad. 
 - What?

245
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.830
The advertisement for the Eastern Medicine Clinic, I—

246
00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.140
Wait a second.

247
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.630
Deputy Jang, get up!

248
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:29.190
Get up, please get up.

249
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:42.900
Deputy Jang, you can't act like this because I've given you the favorite treatment a few times.

250
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.720
I'm doing this because I believe that.

251
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.750
Since you keep infringing on our editorial rights like it's nothing, I'm going to lay here

252
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.730
...like it's nothing.

253
00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.610
Hey, I mean technically, you're not an editor-in-chief.

254
00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.000
You're a... proxy editor.

255
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.790
That's why I'm laying here for Department Chief Shim right now.

256
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.680
Well, do you want to see him? Should I call her for you?

257
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.770
No, no, no.

258
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:13.300
Why would you call someone who just had a baby and is recovering?

259
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.640
Deputy Jang, the reason you can't get married is because you act out like this.

260
00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:27.120
Oh my goodness. You made another inappropriate comment. If you keep it up, I'll really act out and end up hitting you.

261
00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.150
Okay, I get it so get up and let's talk.

262
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:38.820
I'm getting rid of the article.

263
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.490
But since this is a matter that the Editing Department takes care of, they have to take responsibility.

264
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.870
Yes, I'll do that.

265
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.220
We're the department that impacts sales the most.

266
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.760
You don't have anything else to say, right?

267
00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.780
No.

268
00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.470
Goodbye.

269
00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.730
Deputy Jang, a word, please.

270
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.420
Yes.

271
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.900
Ah, yes.

272
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.980
I have no intention of dating you.

273
00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:27.060
I have a wife and kids.

274
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.880
I'm just happy to see you for the first time in a while.

275
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.710
I even prepared your favorite European liquor.

276
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.300
It's been a while since you've been at the studio, want to take a look around?

277
00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.660
I saw it.

278
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.370
Okay.

279
00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:49.180
Your vacation must've been nice.

280
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.910
What about work? You have to start again.

281
00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.500
- Why? 
 - Just because!

282
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:04.310
Well, for you, even if you take a break for a while, you'll get a lot of work,

283
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:08.800
so I was wondering whether you needed to quickly find a studio.

284
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.440
It'll probably be hard to find a studio... Rent has gone up a lot!

285
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.890
You need new equipment, too!

286
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.140
I was trying to be considerate of you because as a whole, the situation here is not great.

287
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.710
If you make your studio... you know!

288
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.600
Wouldn't it be nice to share... with you?

289
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.940
I don't want to.

290
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.470
Oh yeah! Isn't Jang Hari at "the baby"?

291
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:45.720
Look at you... You even remember her name.

292
00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.800
- So Yoon, how's the nose-picking going? 
 - I'm still picking.

293
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.610
Stop picking and lose. Hyojoo, what are you holding onto?

294
00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:02.260
- A breast pump. 
 - Stop trying to pump and wrap it up. What about Yeonho?

295
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.330
I'm... almost done.

296
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.680
Yeah, it's time to stop fighting.

297
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.070
Senior, can't we take a break?

298
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.050
I'm so hungry I could die.

299
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.330
Shall we fill up with some food before we continue?

300
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.500
Was there anything aside from food? Like jewelry or clothes?

301
00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.730
Do you know what kind of story I had to sell to feed you guys this food?

302
00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:34.690
You must've seemed really pathetic since they bought it.

303
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:38.950
Our Soyoon has a talent for just hurting people without reason.

304
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:43.150
- With things like that? 
 - But Senior, why don't you have a man?

305
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.400
Your visual and your specs are so good. Are your standards too high?

306
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:54.560
Hey! Is that what you think of Senior?

307
00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:57.700
Hey, she may look like this...

308
00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:00.660
but she falls in love quick.

309
00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.000
She'll just look at anyone and fall in love!

310
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:05.250
Oh gosh, I hate that.

311
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.440
Exactly, I'm a really easy woman, Right?

312
00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.520
That time was the best. When she fell in love with the man in front of the studio in three seconds.

313
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.450
- How handsome was he? 
 - Hey.

314
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:22.890
He wasn't handsome.

315
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:26.880
That guy was crying.

316
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:45.200
♫ <i>Don't say anything</i> ♫

322
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:28.310

323
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.640
<i>It was my first time seeing a guy cry.</i>

324
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.740

♫ <i>You, like a star </i> ♫

326
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:42.550
I thought she was a completely crazy woman.

327
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:46.140
She's not completely crazy.

328
00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:48.120
You didn't see her gaze.

329
00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.190
I don't want to see it.

330
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:54.950
I don't really like girls who chase.

331
00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.520
So, did you try it with him?

332
00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.500
He was crazy.

333
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:06.190
Enough about men. Children are the problem! What am I going to do?

334
00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:09.200
I'll be 40 next year.

335
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.830
So hurry up and get married, so you can have a baby.

336
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.010
With who? How will she meet them?

337
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:15.890
Wait! Just join a marriage information agency.

338
00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.420
I used to be a born-to-be married power couple VVIP.

339
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.490
Now, I hear from agencies for second marriages.

340
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:27.940
Guys, stop saying useless things and try to find a good looking, rich man.

341
00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.910
A rich, single man would never date an older woman!

342
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.120
Right, right!

343
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.350
Choi Hyojoo.

344
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.200
It looks like you're not aware

345
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:42.050
but it's hard to meet even a regular guy.

346
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:47.070
Any decent guy over 30 that you can date is either someone else's man or he's dead.

347
00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.790
Who gets married nowadays? Just keep living alone.

348
00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:59.520
Yeah!

349
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.920
My friend doesn't date either.

350
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:07.360
She said that if she gets tied down by dating or marriage, she would look a little pathetic.

351
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:10.700
Then I'm behind on trends.

352
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.090
That is true. That generation doesn't understand.

353
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:17.350
- True. 
 - You're the worst.

354
00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:19.420
No!

355
00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:23.190
Maybe it's a problem to be hung up on marriage and having children.

356
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.930
I'm tired... I'm so tired.

357
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.780
Should I tell you something scary?

358
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.090
I'm your future.

359
00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.880
- Why me? 
 - Why is she my future?

360
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.110
You're in big trouble now.

361
00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:00.630
Let's see.

362
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.510
<i>The new editor-in-chief isn't married, right?</i>

363
00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:09.070
<i>She says she can sympathize with new mothers but I can tell she's single.</i>

364
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.990
<i>A single lady talking about childcare? What could she know?</i>

365
00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.450
<i>If you're single, can you really be a reporter on childcare?</i>

366
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:21.330
<i>Women with children can't be reporters. They work overtime a lot and don't go home often.</i>

367
00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:29.640
<i>Everything in the magazine is right... but try raising a child and see if it works.</i>

368
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.660
<i>Raising a child through writing and in real life are totally different.</i>

369
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:37.040
<i>There's no way you would know, you haven't raised a child.</i>

370
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.480
<i>Deputy Jang,</i>

371
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.510
<i>how would you like to move to Unique or The House?</i>

372
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.930
<i>You've been in "the baby" for too long. </i>

373
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:50.610
<i>If Department Head Shin comes back to work, when are you going to get a promotion?</i>

374
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:56.070
<i>Even if the editor-in-chief position is vacant, it would be hard for you.</i>

375
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:01.250
<i>You know, right? They don't let single women be editor-in-chief for "the baby."</i>

376
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.500
<i>Do you think I'll never get married?</i>

377
00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:13.530
<i>- What? 
 - I want to have a child. If I meet someone, I'm going to hurry into it.</i>

378
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:17.030
<i>When is that?</i>

379
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.510
<i>Don't stay at an impossible childcare magazine.</i>

380
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:25.530
<i>Go where an editor-in-chief spot is guaranteed and get settled.</i>

381
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:29.450
<i>I'm saying this for your sake.</i>

382
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.350
Hari doesn't come here often.

383
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.360
There's no reason you'll run into her!

384
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.480
Seriously...

385
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.510
Do you have a place?

386
00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.100
I moved today. In Hangangdong near the park.

387
00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.310
Hangangdong...

388
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.860
Park?

389
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.480
Of all places...

390
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.120
Hari's neighborhood.

391
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:16.420
- Hello. 
 - Welcome!

392
00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.820
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course.

What's "Owner's Choice"?

395
00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.790
It's today's special menu. Mackerel gratin.

396
00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:32.600
- It's not that fishy. Try it. 
 - Yes, of course.

397
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:41.400
- I'll bring it to you. 
 - Sounds tasty.

398
00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:54.430
- How was it? 
 - It... was good.

399
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.200
- I enjoyed it. 
 - Yeah!

400
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.730
Okay... the mackerel gratin is here.

<i>If you drink this, we're dating. Okay?</i>

403

<i>What if I don't drink it?</i>

404

<i>Then nothing happens between us.</i>

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:26.960
Mom?

Hey, you!

410
00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.760
- You're back? 
 - Whoa!

411
00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.950
What are you doing here?

412
00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:00.050
I moved here yesterday.

413
00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.530
- Who moved in? To our house? 
 - Yeah.

414
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.360
Why would you? Who are you to be moving into my house?

415
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.260
I'm a new tenant here now.

416
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.860
What nonsense are you saying?

417
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.960
Did my mom let you come here?

418
00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:21.890
Auntie asked to come and live here first.

419
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.380
I hadn't heard anything about this!

420
00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.970
You must be tired. Let's have some breakfast.

421
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.770
That's all right, I don't need any food.

422
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:34.810
Hey! You've got to be kidding me. Get out!

423
00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:48.570
I don't have anywhere else to go.

424
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:52.210
Did you lose your house to Seo Jungwon?

425
00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:55.690
Are you joking? She was at fault. Why would I lose the house?

426
00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.410
She insisted on paying back all the borrowed money, too.

427
00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:01.210
At least she had a conscience. Terrible girl.

428
00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:05.350
She was terrible... How could she do that to me?

429
00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.730
You have no conscience.

430
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.040
How can you just chatter away at me, after turning up for the first time in five years,

431
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:16.120
while looking right at me as if this was nothing strange?

432
00:34:21.970 --> 00:34:24.570
Then I'll talk without looking at you.

433
00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:32.440
To be honest, it's because I don't think I can stand living alone with my kid.

434
00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.440
Mom and Dad want me to return to the States.

435
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:38.590
Where?

436
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.830
You're all I have left, my friend.

437
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:45.610
After all this time,

438
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:50.320
after cutting me out of your life because Seo Jungwon said she hated me,

439
00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.930
you come back acting as if nothing happened

440
00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:56.300
because she left you.

441
00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.880
My daughter Doha is in that room.

442
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.280
Have a look at her face, and then we can talk it over again.

443
00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:23.610
Hi! So you're Doha. My goodness,

444
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:26.810
so cute!

445
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:34.190
Do you not wash your kid?

446
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.940
Kids are supposed to be messy when they eat. That's perfectly normal.

447
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.060
Why is her baby bottle so small?

448
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:46.160
If she's 8 months old, you have to get her one that's 240 ml!

449
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.590
How did you know she's 8 months old?

450
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.330
How did you end up with a dad like that? Right?

451
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:58.850
You poor little thing. Our poor little Doha.

452
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.250
Isn't my Doha super cute?

453
00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:06.230
Yes. Since she's so cute, I'll give you a day. Pack up and leave by tomorrow.

454
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:10.080
Even if she's this cute? And just turned 8 months old?

455
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.090
We have nowhere to go.

456
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:17.850
Okay then. My deadline is by 2:00 a.m. You can leave Doha here, but get out before I'm back.

457
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.810
I'm going to report you; give me back my daughter.

458
00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.290
Isn't that lady scary?

459
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.390
This is all because of you! Don't cry.

460
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.600
Mom, are you Jaeyoung's mom?

461
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.050
That poor thing is practically a beggar,

462
00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.030
<i>I didn't feel too good about his situation.</i>

463
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:57.660
You only need to add one extra pair of chopsticks on the table,

464
00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.730
<i>and check if he's feeding his kid well.</i>

465
00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.840
I heard all Jaeyoung does is drink. Make sure he doesn't.

466
00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.000
You can't even do that much?

467
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.300
Did he become a patient after he got divorced?

468
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.660
Why do we have to take care of him?

469
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.470
Okay, I'll send Jaeyoung out. You leave, too.

470
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.780
Why should I?

471
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.260
It's not your house, it's mine.

472
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:19.730
<i>You think you're the homeowner, even though you're not even paying the rent? </i>

473
00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:23.030
Telling me to make the new tenant leave and whatnot. If you don't like it, you leave!

474
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:26.280
Are you really Jaeyoung's mom? Can you be like this to your daughter?

475
00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:28.960
I would love to switch you for him.

476
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:32.130
Hang up now. I need to exercise.

477
00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.460
<i>A delivery plan? 
 [Year-long Delivery Plan for Infertile Couples]</i>

478
00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:56.100
Since infertility support is expanding, we can use the annual plan to work with infertile couples.

479
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:02.440
We can publish the entire process from treatment, to a successful pregnancy, and the birth of the baby.

480
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.180
It sounds good!

481
00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.820
Then, for the pregnant woman's experience...

482
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:10.260
Our team leader had an idea for the pregnant woman's experience.

483
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.190
If you were to accept that,

484
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:17.230
I think it would be easier to convince the higher-ups.

485
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.250
What is it?

486
00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.640
Expecting fathers say that they're sick of experiencing it themselves.

487
00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:27.900
So if a reporter were to experience it themselves and provide a fresh perspective!

488
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.490
They even brought it up to me during the meeting.

489
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.370
Really...

490
00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.760
Why would I?

491
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.860
Are you going to smile or not?

492
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.410
Why am I doing this just for some advertising money?

493
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.020
I will make sure to speak highly of you to your superiors.

494
00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.460
Okay! Then, let's think of the baby inside your belly and smile?

495
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.770
Smile!

496
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.930
It's lightning. A bolt of lightning.

497
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:03.400
That's an aggressive nickname for your fetus.

498
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.960
I'm with child all of a sudden.

499
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:09.710
Then let's all of a sudden smile once.

500
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.530
Come on! Okay, come on!

501
00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.070
Smile, please!

502
00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:14.380
Smile! You can do it!

503
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.780
You can do it!

504
00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:17.760
Smile!

505
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.420
Smile!  Perfect!

506
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:25.140
Did it come out well?

507
00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:28.200
Okay, let's take a look.

508
00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.580
It's fine, right?

509
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.090
<i>- Right? 
 - I like the one before better.</i>

510
00:39:46.890 --> 00:39:49.270
Why?

511
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.300
Just leave it. I'll wear it out.

512
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.780
I have to do it right!

513
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:16.130
Is the studio okay? It looked like it'd be hard to get Sanghee.

514
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.360
He said he's sharing because of the rent.

515
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.280
- He mentioned Yisang... 
 - Who?

516
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.540
Why? How do you two know each other?

517
00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.760
- We don't know each other. 
 - They went on a blind date.

518
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.720
You went on a blind date?

519
00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.790
It wasn't really a blind date...

520
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:35.620
That man cursed her, deep into her heart.

521
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:40.060
I think she can't date because of that curse.

522
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.750
Why, now of all times, are you talking about that person?

523
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.920
I'm struggling so much I could die.

524
00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.840
Stop. Smile.

525
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:57.700
I saw him once before but he looked normal.

526
00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.110
He's a crazy bastard who looks normal.

527
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.430
<i>It's that guy?</i>

528
00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:09.950
<i>Han Yisang. He's the best photographer around right now.</i>

529
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.530
<i>He's two years older than you.</i>

530
00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:18.900
<i>How should I put it? He looks like he has a story.</i>

531
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.690
<i>Oh no. Is it bad if he has a story?</i>

532
00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:25.590
<i>Having a story at that age is nothing! I knew it. I could tell right away.</i>

533
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:26.550
<i>Do you think it'll be okay?</i>

534
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:29.950
<i>No one's perfect! He just can't be crazy.</i>

535
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.930
<i>Okay, then hold on just a minute. He just got back from an overseas shoot today,</i>

536
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.350
<i>so I haven't gotten the chance to speak with him yet. </i>

537
00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:36.900
<i>- Stay here. 
 - Okay!</i>

538
00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:45.390
<i>It looks like you've made up your mind!</i>

539
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:48.760
<i>Are you getting married next year?</i>

540
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.980
<i>If I think I found the right man, I have to latch on.</i>

541
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.760
<i>Yisang, that person I told you about before is over there.</i>

542
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:08.110
<i>Why is she acting like that?</i>

543
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:09.720
<i>It's because she is so innocent.</i>

544
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:13.120
<i>I told her I was going to introduce her to a really cool guy today.</i>

545
00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.480
<i>I'm celibate.</i>

546
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.410
<i>Since when?</i>

547
00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.500
<i>- Starting now. 
 - Why!</i>

548
00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.130
<i>I should meet him for at least a year before marrying, right?</i>

549
00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.790
<i>You haven't even met him yet!</i>

550
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:29.490
<i>I know! I can introduce myself today and then get married to him next year.</i>

551
00:42:29.490 --> 00:42:30.920
<i>Why do I need to get married?</i>

552
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.420
<i>You get lonely living alone.</i>

553
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.570
<i>- Living alone is peaceful. 
 - How can you live without a family?</i>

554
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.440
<i>It's nice to have a husband who can be your friend your entire life and have two sons and two daughters together.</i>

555
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.980
<i>But since I'm getting old, I guess I will settle for just two kids.</i>

556
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.230
<i>In my life, there is no such thing as listening to my wife nagging.</i>

557
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:50.080
<i>I only have to support myself and I don't need to spend my personal time on a kid.</i>

558
00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.150
<i>Oh, and I love to watch TV.</i>

559
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.620
<i>Okay, then go stare at him and try to catch his attention.</i>

560
00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.930
<i>Be a good audience. "Oh my, really?" Show him good reactions.</i>

561
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:04.240
<i>Then touch him ever so slightly while you're at it.</i>

562
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.770
<i>Touch him? During our first encounter?</i>

563
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:08.920
<i>Senior, skinship is just the basics.</i>

564
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.620
<i>I had my first kiss with my husband using this technique on our first encounter.</i>

565
00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.050
<i>Kiss?</i>

566
00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.820
<i>But we aren't even in a loving relationship yet.</i>

567
00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.260
<i>Why should you try so hard to get married anyway?</i>

568
00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.230
<i>I can't be so old fashioned; it's disillusioning.</i>

569
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.700
<i>Am I part of a primitive tribe? Should I have children to preserve our people?</i>

570
00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:32.250
<i>Okay!</i>

571
00:43:32.250 --> 00:43:35.340
<i>Nevermind, let's not do this.</i>

572
00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:45.220
<i>Wow, your arms are really... Great!</i>

573
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.850
<i>You must like snow.</i>

574
00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:32.980
<i>I do, too.</i>

575
00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.880
<i>- Where is the chief? 
 - Probably in the studio.</i>

576
00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.690
<i>I heard you went to the same university as the chief?</i>

577
00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.210
<i>Yes.</i>

578
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.570
<i>I'm Jang Hari, deputy-editor of "the baby" Magazine.</i>

579
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.720
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

580
00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:55.690
<i>You think it's nice to meet me? Me too.</i>

581
00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:03.050
<i>With just one touch, I went as far as the first kiss with my husband.</i>

582
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:07.900
<i>I heard that you take some nice photos.</i>

583
00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:11.760
<i>Is your specialty pictures for magazines, advertisements, or...</i>

584
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:16.580
<i>What are you doing?</i>

585
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.640
<i>I got such a good first impression from you when I saw you earlier.</i>

586
00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.860
<i>- So what? 
 - What?</i>

587
00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.650
<i>You have no fear. What if I'm a bad guy?</i>

588
00:45:32.650 --> 00:45:34.610
<i>You are not a bad guy, though.</i>

589
00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:39.160
<i>You don't look like a bad person. I could just tell.</i>

590
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.950
<i>You could just tell? Are you saying that you fell in love with me at first sight?</i>

591
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:48.300
<i>If you're going to say it's something like fate... that's even scarier.</i>

592
00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:52.860
<i>Excuse me, I barely introduced myself.</i>

593
00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.290
<i>What kind of introduction is so abrupt?</i>

594
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:58.850
<i>If you felt some type of way because of me, it's desires caused by your hormones.</i>

595
00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:02.720
<i>Don't hypnotize yourself into thinking it was some fated romance.</i>

596
00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.030
<i>Wait, excuse me!</i>

597
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:14.580
<i>You are saying that I implied I wanted to do something with you because of my desires?</i>

598
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:18.150
<i>You aren't that good-looking.</i>

599
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:22.890
<i>Hey, Jang Hari, let me give you some advice on our first meeting.</i>

600
00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.040
<i>If you're lonely...</i>

601
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:34.990
<i>then get a pet dog.</i>

602
00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:55.620
<i>I recognized him. I recognized a crazy bastard. </i>

603
00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:03.960
Are there any that have two stripes across?

604
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.080
No, we only have this design.

605
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:10.330
Or maybe something that has, like, a glossy look here,

606
00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:14.000
and perhaps some embroidery, too?

607
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.770
Do you have anything like that?

608
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.040
No, we do not.

609
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.950
You don't have quite a lot of things.

610
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.320
That guy's totally a psychopath!

611
00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:26.220
Right?

612
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.760
You shouldn't worry about it. He's quite successful, so he's probably setting up his own studio.

613
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:32.010
That's a relief.

614
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:34.220
Even if I meet him and he recognizes me,

615
00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.030
I will act like I don't know him.

616
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:59.670
<i>Oh no, I missed the chance to dodge him.</i>

617
00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:11.610
<i>Get a pet dog instead.</i>

618
00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:49.160
Long time no see...

619
00:48:52.590 --> 00:48:54.740
Oh my goodness.

620
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:04.020

621
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.590
What did he say? Did he recognize you?

622
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:12.210
No, I pretended not to recognize him first.

623
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:13.730
Ow.

624
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:15.060
Give me a moment.

625
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:18.290
Why are you acting like you're in pain all of a sudden?

626
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.210
Nevermind.

627
00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:23.440
- Does it hurt again? 
 - Does it hurt a lot?

628
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:26.090
You guys can go first, I'll head to the company after I take some medications.

629
00:49:26.090 --> 00:49:28.610
Give this to me.

630
00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.320
Ow.

631
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.270
What's wrong with her?

632
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.670
It's her period.

633
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.430
Let's go.

634
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.780
It's okay. Get going.

635
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.330
Oh no, I think her water broke.

636
00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:30.270
Oh no, you should go to the hospital.

637
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:32.590
No, it's okay!

638
00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.630
I think she is having contractions. Should we call the ambulance?

639
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:39.310
No, she needs to go to the hospital she's used to!

640
00:50:39.310 --> 00:50:41.290
Just wait a little. It's your first child, right?

641
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.560
No, that's not it.

642
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.080
Is it your second child?

643
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.880
Don't they come out quicker.

644
00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.480
Yeah!

645
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.590
This is not a child.

646
00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:52.490
It's your third child?

647
00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:55.090
What are we going to do! She's in labor. She's in labor!

648
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:57.580
Let's go to the hospital!

649
00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.920
No, wait.

650
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.720
Get the elevator!

651
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:04.690
It's a misunderstanding!

652
00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.130
Why is it taking so long?

653
00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:07.890
Let's take the escalator.

654
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:08.820
No, wait.

655
00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:10.600
Come on!

656
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:12.620
Move out of the way!

657
00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.540
She is going into labor!

658
00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.310
Oh no!

659
00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:18.460
What to do?

660
00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:19.590
Hey! MIster! 
 (T/N: Literally means "uncle.")

661
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.910
Excuse me!

662
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.140
I'm not pregnant...

663
00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:25.950
Sir! This woman is in labor, right now!

664
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:29.960
Are you okay?

665
00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:32.020
Excuse us!

666
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:39.190
I'm not an uncle.

667
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.660
Just hang in there a little more!

668
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.960
Ouch!

669
00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.420
Oh no!

670
00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:52.950
Can you please let go of me?

671
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:55.020
Why are you doing this to me?

672
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.940
Please, let go!

673
00:51:56.940 --> 00:51:59.020
- Hey, it's over— 
 - I'm telling you it's this way!

674
00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:01.610
We parked on this side.

675
00:52:01.610 --> 00:52:03.250
Where is it?

676
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:05.810
Where?

677
00:52:05.810 --> 00:52:07.750
No, we parked over there.

678
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:09.420
No, we didn't!

679
00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:11.460
Listen to me.

680
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.250
They all look the same.

681
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.430
Where is it?

682
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:19.230
Wait, I'll help.

683
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:30.210
<i>Thank you!</i>

684
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:32.230
<i>What a relief!</i>

685
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.760
Stay strong!

686
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.460
Good luck with delivering the baby!

687
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.810
- Which hospital? 
 - Why are you all doing this to me?

688
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.890
- Just wait a moment. I'll take you there quickly. 
 - No. It's fine.

689
00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.040
You can do it!

690
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.380
Oh, it hurts.

691
00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:08.660
Are you all right? Where should I go?

692
00:53:08.660 --> 00:53:11.970
Over there... in front of the pharmacy.

693
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.870
I don't think we should... I'll go to the nearest hospital!

694
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:19.210
No, excuse me. It's fine.

695
00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:29.190
Slow— Slowly.

696
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.580
Let go! Let go!

697
00:53:39.580 --> 00:53:42.110
Excuse me. Excuse me.

698
00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:45.140
She's exploding!

699
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.420
I told you I was fine.

700
00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.380
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

701
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:57.930
Isn't she close to delivering the baby?

702
00:53:57.930 --> 00:54:00.800
The doc will be here soon.

703
00:54:02.090 --> 00:54:04.730
Stop. It hurts!

704
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:06.860
When did your contractions start?

705
00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.650
I'm going to go crazy.

706
00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.540
I'm going to lift this up really quickly.

707
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.280
No. You can't.

708
00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.990
You cannot be like this.

709
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:16.390
Hey, you can't!

710
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.010
Oh, it hurts.

711
00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:27.790
If it's this bad, isn't the child coming out?

712
00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.630
Please prepare the ultrasound now!

713
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:34.300
Ultrasound? Why?

714
00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.780
Guardian, one moment, please.

715
00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:38.460
Guardian? I'm not her guardian.

716
00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.850
When is her due date?

717
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.570
Jang Hari!

718
00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:46.750
Where are you going?

719
00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.200
Jang Hari!

720
00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:25.380
<i>Jang Hari.</i>

721
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:27.980
Jang Hari, are you all right?

722
00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:38.020
Please check her blood pressure.

723
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.690
I don't have any gauze.

724
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.120
It's here!

725
00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:04.790
I'll be right back!

726
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:07.030
I'll be right back!

727
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:15.820
- Excuse me? 
 - I feel like it could be endometriosis.

728
00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:20.570
Take a look here. There's a large build-up of tissue here around your ovary.

729
00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:23.610
It looks like there would be a lot of pain because it's quite large.

730
00:56:23.610 --> 00:56:26.530
Why did you endure this?

731
00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.430
Is it really bad?

732
00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:31.210
Well, it's fine if you get surgery.

733
00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:35.150
But you got a test for the age of your ovaries because you wanted to freeze your eggs.

734
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:37.910
Our Jang Hari's ovaries' ages are...

735
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:40.330
40.

736
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.260
The truth is, after 35, your eggs release less often,

737
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:47.400
so we don't recommend freezing your eggs.

738
00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.830
You should have done it in your twenties or early thirties.

739
00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:54.090
If you're 39, it's too late.

740
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:58.330
Is it impossible?

741
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:04.100
It will be difficult for you to find a young, good man.

742
00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.990
Even if you freeze your eggs,

743
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:11.620
you could be injured during the fertilization process.

744
00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:14.860
Is there no solution?

745
00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:21.760
For you, your chance of natural pregnancy is less than 7%.

746
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:25.370
Okay. If you're in your forties, the chance of natural pregnancy is less than 5%.

747
00:57:25.370 --> 00:57:30.370
After 43, the success rate of a test tube pregnancy is less than 10%.

748
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:34.850
The chance of miscarriage before 10 weeks is 90%.

749
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.450
Then... can I never have a child?

750
00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.950
Am I unable to have a child?

751
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:51.850
Pregnancy isn't easy in the first place but after endometrial surgery, for one year,

752
00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:54.900
you will not be able to get pregnant during that recovery.

753
00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.330
Every month, your fertility decreases but what do you think will happen after a year?

754
00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:02.280
Pregnancy would be more difficult, right?

755
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.560
Oh.

756
00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.410
I have to go to the pharmacy.

757
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:26.520
<i>Senior, where are you? Why aren't you coming?</i>

758
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:28.620
Oh, this is...

759
00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:35.330
I'm not sure.

760
00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:54.010
She would have brought clothes from the office.

761
00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.830
This... This is my...

Jang Hari, what are you doing here?

I'm looking for the pharmacy right now.
