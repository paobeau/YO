<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.860
You must have given it lots of thought,

4
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.220
judging from how sunken your face has become.

5
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.610
After that day, I kept thinking about it.

6
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.520
Why you would be doing this.

7
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.780
You're someone who had an affair before Young Min could even walk.

8
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.150
You're someone who gave up custody without a second thought in court.

9
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.970
Why are you suddenly talking about reclaiming rights to custody?

10
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.570
Why are your efforts to bring down the person I'm having an affair with,

11
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.990
greater than your efforts to actually bring back your son?

12
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.940
How could your rights to custody over your son have been placed on the same scale as Han Jae Hyeon?

13
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.220
Have you found the answer to why that could've happened?

14
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.940
25 years ago, my dad told me something about opportunity cost.

15
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.180
To choose one, you must give up another.

16
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.120
You can either pick the thing you want the most, or avoid the thing you fear the most.

17
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.120
You have to pick one or the other.

18
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.900
So?

19
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.180
I...

20
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.070
decided to avoid what I fear the most.

21
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.540
Then and now,

22
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.050
the thing I dread the most

23
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.120
is that person being ruined because of me.

24
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.350
Whether my choice is correct or not,

25
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.530
I will return to you.

26
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.010
<i>When My Love Blooms </i>

27
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.100
<i>Episode 7</i> 
 It's not like you're being dragged to hell.

28
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970
Your sad expression is a bit much.

29
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.400
I'm sure it'll get better.

30
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.490
I'm sure you've changed, but so have I.

31
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.030
I'm not dumb enough to make the same mistake twice.

32
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.470
How should we proceed with the marriage?

33
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.510
Do whatever you want.

34
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.550
I'll give you some time, so take care of anything you need to.

35
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.490
Especially... things like relationships of the past.

36
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.550
We're breezing through because you're complying so well with our investigation.

37
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.840
Let's continue after a meal. What would you like, ox bone soup or hangover soup?

38
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.110
I'll go with the hangover soup.

39
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.950
<i>Hyeong Seong Group Vice President Han Jae Hyeon in prosecution for borrowed-name shares. </i>

40
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.280
You shouldn't have sought out Ji Soo.

41
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.680
He filed for a return of custody.

42
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860
Ji Soo's ex-husband.

43
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.410
Is it because... of what happened at school?

44
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.940
No. It's because of you.

45
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.790
He said he suspects an affair.

46
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.210
It's basically green onion soup.

47
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.510
I love green onion so much, so I always put this much in.

48
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.110
It's crunchy but cheap, and leaves your mouth with a refreshing aftertaste.

49
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.580
Green onion is the best as grabbing any excessively oily tastes.

50
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.180
I started putting in more and more green onion as I worked here.

51
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.560
Vice President, when are you going to reveal the next big thing?

52
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.220
What are you talking about?

53
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.730
You shouldn't belittle Korea's prosecutors.

54
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.370
Listen.

55
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.110
On one bright and sunny day,

56
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.990
a few files about Hyeong Seong group arrived to our prosecutors office.

57
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:43.060
It was organized so well that it was easy to read and understand in a glance.

58
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.900
We were wondering what this was.

59
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.250
Then a few days after,

60
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:53.360
the same things were being discussed in the newspaper and on broadcast.

61
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.120
If someone didn't know any better, they might think we released the news ourself.

62
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.960
As an unofficial report.

63
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.650
Is that what happened?

64
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.340
Since then, we went on as we usually would,

65
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.020
and that lead to us bringing you here for an investigation.

66
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.190
You, who ended up here,

67
00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:12.740
came alone, without a lawyer that all rich people hold onto so dearly.

68
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.740
You've spoken freely about this whole case, without no mismatch or mistake with the evidence we already have.

69
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.520
I didn't need any of these questions I have prepared ahead of time.

70
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:32.000
If investigations were always like this, being a prosecutor would be easy.

71
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.210
Don't you think these details add sum on the picture? It's not a mere coincidence.

72
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.510
The prosecutors of this country are not like buses or subway trains that travel a set path according to schedule.

73
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.600
We're definitely not like some tax who comes and goes whenever you call.

74
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:55.840
Won't you tell me now... what your next plans are.

75
00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.210
Eat up... before your green onion gets cold. 
 ('green onion soup' sounds like the word for collapse/distruction in Korean)

76
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.410
Let's move on.

77
00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.250
Sir, do you have anything to tell us?

78
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.490
Are you really involved in this?

79
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.510
Please tell us something!

80
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.690
How did it go?

81
00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.220
It went well.

82
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.580
Who did it go well for?

83
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.240
What are you talking about?

84
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.430
Did it go well for you, or did it go well for my dad?

85
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.290
Which side is better for you?

86
00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.940
Me? I hope it went for both sides.

87
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.440
Together, without conflict.

88
00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.610
For now, there will be no issues for either side.

89
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:21.180
Are there any other issues?

90
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.660
Other things, not related to work.

91
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.830
I wish you would act as you always have.

92
00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.730
Okay. Beating around the bush doesn't suit me, and I can't do it.

93
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.070
Yoon Ji Soo... is there nothing going on with her?

94
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.650
A pending file to return custody.

95
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.620
I know about that much? Is that good for you?

96
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.570
For now.

97
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.950
What happened to your feet?

98
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.360
I walked around so much.

99
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.650
Why did you do that?

100
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.790
Because I disliked them.

101
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.150
Who is it this time?

102
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.040
Me.

103
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.160
You have a temper.

104
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.550
Goodness, you're in such horrible condition.

105
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.780
Your feet look like they belong to a princess.

106
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:40.250
Why do you use them so carelessly?

107
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:44.990
You have to cherish yourself if you want others to cherish you, too.

108
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.440
Granny... can you be my mom?

109
00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.930
Why would I be your mom?

110
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.120
Just because...

111
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.280
Because I miss my mom.

112
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.250
I want someone to call me crazy,

113
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.420
and hit some sense into me.

114
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.160
Is something really wrong?

115
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:23.090
It hurts, the ointment.

116
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.930
Just push through a bit.

117
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.210
It'll get better soon.

118
00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.670
There's no wound in the world that won't heal.

119
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.510
Granny, you're really smart.

120
00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.680
Did you only just find out?

121
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.660
It isn't good to laugh while crying!

122
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.290
-Yes? 
-<i>Is this Mrs.Yoon Ji Soo?</i>

123
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.470
Who is this?

124
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:23.110
<i>Hey! Ji Soo you don't even remember your brother-in-law's voice?</i>

125
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:26.370
Dong Jin Sunbae?

126
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:30.160
Wow. You haven't changed a bit.

127
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.620
The top three beauty of the class of '93 seems to still fit you well.

128
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:35.130
You too.

129
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:38.600
Of course. I don't look my age at all.

130
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.550
The problem is thatI am constantly going to keep looking younger.

131
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.130
I sometimes feel like I'm going to become a baby at some point.

132
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.810
and although I may not seem like it, I'm amazing at this kind of stuff.

133
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.160
So that's why I'm saying, I'll take charge. The child custody case.

134
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.860
Divorce is my specialty, so I can deal with the child custody case with my eyes closed.

135
00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:02.820
"I don't want to lose to the likes of someone else" That is  my firm's slogan.

136
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.830
Anyway. Consider yourself really lucky because I can make the divorce process a breeze.

137
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.490
- Sunbae. 
-Ah it's okay.

138
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.890
Don't worry about it. Especially with a relationship like ours.

139
00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:15.980
I'm not going to take legal action.

140
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.530
You're not? Ah. Is it because of the money?

141
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.750
Although it is true that I am the best divorce attorney in all of Korea

142
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.680
You, especially, are free of charge.

143
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.530
How could I take money from you?

144
00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.810
I am grateful for your consideration.

145
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:33.910
However, I decided not to pursue the legal action.

146
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.360
She cancelled it? Why so suddenly?

147
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.490
I don't know.

148
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.740
You should have figured out exactly why.

149
00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:45.820
Isn't it good news if she decides not to take action?

150
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:48.810
It would be weirder to ask why she won't be pursuing it.

151
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.610
-Hey Joon Woo 
-Yes.

152
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:58.390
It looks like you will have to follow someone.

153
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:03.030
I'll say that you took a vacation, use someone else for the time being so move inconspicuously.

154
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.120
Yes. I understand. But, who will I be following?

155
00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.520
Attorney Lee Se Hoon. Ji Soo's ex-husband.

156
00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.680
From the time he leaves  his house until the time he comes back

157
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.110
find out where he's been, who he's with, what he's doing without missing a single detail.

158
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:19.020
Yes. I understand.

159
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.270
Welcome.

160
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.140
- Hello. 
- Why do you greet me like that all time like we're strangers.

161
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.110
you should say "I'm home" instead.

162
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:30.900
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.810
Go wash up.

164
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:39.070
That boy is so feminine.

165
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.410
Is it because he's always with his mom?

166
00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.720
We've decided to reconcile.

167
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.220
What?

168
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.010
- Do what? 
- Reconcile.

169
00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:49.720
Have you been swayed by that tool?

170
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.490
It's been decided that way, so please deal with it.

171
00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:57.090
If you show your discontent to Young Min, I won't see you.

172
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.700
I enjoyed watching it.

173
00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.910
How is this place?

174
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:10.220
I think it's nice.

175
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.320
You like it here and you liked the previous place too. You like them all?

176
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.050
You lack some backbone for a boy, son.

177
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.520
One second. Keep playing okay?

178
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.880
Dad said this is the house we will be living together in.

182
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.300
what do you when you start to have these thoughts when you aren't doing something?

183
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.810
I go home and sleep.

184
00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:20.470
A lesson got cancelled, so going home doesn't seem right.

185
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:22.050
Go drink coffee.

186
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.210
I won't be able to sleep. I have trouble sleeping as it is.

187
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.650
Then just drink.

188
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:30.010

191
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.590
Lone Corner?

192
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.570
Is that for boxing? Blue corner, red corner, something like that?

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:50.190
You're getting a remarriage?

212
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.840
That's not something to be proud of when you live poorly.

213

You have to hurry and clean it up, you'll get hurt.

214

What's your real reason?

215
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.530
Is it Jae Hyeon again?

216
00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.840
It's not. It's because of Young Min.

217
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.730
You got a divorce because of Young Min.

218
00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:20.040
You know too much about me. I should keep my distance.

219
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.330
You... know nothing about me.

220
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:27.560
- Me? Hey, I even know what girls are your ty- 
 - Ouch.

221
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.730
Does it hurt to press on it?

222
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.660
Maybe the glass got embedded, let's see.

223
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.540
Can you hold this?

224
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.220
I don't think anything's in there. Why does it hurt?

225
00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.630
It hurts because of you.

226
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:59.470
What are you saying?

227
00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.810
I hurt because of you.

228
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.120
Because I like you.

229
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:17.320
I... like you.

230
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:40.440
I'm not against your remarriage because that takes away an opportunity from me.

231
00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:47.040
If that was the case, I wouldn't have just watch from afar for all these years.

232
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.630
There's no glass, so raise your hand above you head.

233
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.980
I saw in a movie

234
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:02.570
that if you finger is above your heart, it'll stop bleeding.

235
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.440
I just lost a friend.

236
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:19.860
Will you listen to me... if I stay as a friend?

237
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:28.420
I didn't confess because I also didn't want to lose my only friend.

238
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.920
It wasn't too bad, because we had no reason to split up.

239
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.190
But I want to stop now.

240
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:42.730
I want to move from behind you to beside you.

241
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.020
I can't watch you walking into a hellish fire like that.

242
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:58.020

244
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.950
I don't think we can see each other anymore.

245
00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.900
I won't be able to come here once I return to Young Min's dad,

246
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.090
but we're saying farewell earlier than I expected.

247
00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:25.130
Put some ointment on it, instead of a bandage. You need air to flow to it.

248
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.740
Vacuum and mop the floors.

249
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.530
Anyways, I'll be going now.

250
00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.750

Are you still not part of an anti-government group?

256
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.730
They're book about the history of philosophy.

257
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.310
They're cultural pieces that are used in the school's curriculum.

00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.980
"Building Socialism Through Worker's Solidarity"

259
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.490
It's written here so blatantly, but it's a 'cultural piece'?

260
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:02.010
Freedom of thought is protected by the constitution.

261
00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:06.980
How can it protect a thought that is going to overturn the law?

262
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:24.240
Ji Soo... has always been kind and full of affection.

263
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:29.120
As such, she was soft-hearted and could never stand her ground.

264
00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.920
She's always thought of others and been grateful for them,

265
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.500
giving others whatever she had.

266
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:42.370
But what returned was always manipulation, betrayal, and empty hands.

267
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:49.320
She's always been the dearest to me, so it was even more infuriating.

268
00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.470
I was always worried that she might tread a thorny path.

269
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.620
If you don't give up Ji Soo,

270
00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.960
you will spend a few years in jail.

319
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.690
Why not? Do they say something to you?

320
00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.550
They don't say anything to me. They whisper behind my back.

321
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.010
What do they say behind your back then?

322
00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.920
That I've changed because of a girl.

323
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.620
That's not true.

324
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.810
You told me you broke up with her.

325
00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.160
Are you okay?

326
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.230
I'm not going to school to try to be okay.

327
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.270
If I go to school, then Ji Soo is everywhere.

328
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.830
Ji Soo,

329
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:26.200
when you arrive at the Frankfurt airport, the homestay owner will be waiting for you. He's Korean.

330
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.610
Sis, apparently he's super good looking. You're so lucky!

331
00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.810
Who cares if the homestay owner is good looking?

332
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:34.220
- Not the owner. 
 - Ji Young!

333
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:41.460
- What are you talking about? 
 - Huh?

334
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.780
It's nothing.

335
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.850
Won't you tell me?

336
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.080
He's the youngest son from the Sungkuk Industry, and I heard he's studying abroad near you.

337
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.940
Is this the Joseon Dynasty? Do you want me to get an arranged marriage?

338
00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:59.450
What do you mean, marriage? I'm just saying try meeting him.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.640
<i> I could just stay at your house. </i>

<i> You are not planning to go back home? </i>

369
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.170
<i> Yes. </i>

370
00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.460
<i> What do you plan to do then? </i>

371
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.620
<i> I plan to marriage you. </i>

372

<i> Gang Chon </i>

373
00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:05.970
- <i> Let's write here too </i> 
 - <i> Write what? </i>

374
00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:09.330
<i> Jae Hyun and Ji Soo were here. </i>

375
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:11.620
<i> Let's not do things like that. </i>

376
00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:16.560
<i> I hear Germany's Heidelberg Castle is covered with Korean tourists' graffiti. </i>

377
00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.240
<i> Don't talk about Germany. </i>

378
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.350
<i> Hyung Sung </i>

379
00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.080
It looks like he's planning to move.

380
00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.210
He's looking at houses. 
 - Houses?

381
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:47.770
Yes. Mainly pastoral houses in the suburban area.

382
00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.280
He takes his son with him, when he goes to look at houses.

383
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.540
He takes Yeong Min?

384
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:57.810
Yes. It's seems like they might live together.

385
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.510
<i> Why am in pain? Because I like you. </i>

386
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:16.450
<i> Because I like you. </i>

387
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:24.050
<i> I will give you time. If you need to tidy up anything, do so. Especially... </i>

388
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:26.580
<i> Especially things like lingering old flames. </i>

389
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.210
<i> Dad said it's the house where we will live together. </i>

390
00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.510
Nothing is easy.

391
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.700
It's okay. It's okay.

392
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.940
You seem hurt.

393
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.650
I bumped into something.

394
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:44.290
Are you okay?

395
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.030
Yes, I am fine.

396
00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.730
But then, why did you want to see me?

397
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:52.420
There is something I wanted to confirm.

398
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.590
I heard your ex-husband wanted to file for full child custody.

399
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.010
I am sure that is  why you sent Dong Jin Sunbae to me.

400
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:06.850
I heard the plans to file were cancelled, did your ex-husband decide to drop the complaint?

401
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.340
No.

402
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.080
We decided to live together again.

403
00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.920
Why would you choose to do such a thing?

404
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:32.720
Because I want to protect something.

405
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.900
What do you want to protect?

406
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.130
Yeong Min?

407
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.890
Will that really protect Yeong Min?

408
00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.000
He is at an age where he needs his father...

409
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.150
There is little I can do for him because he is a boy.

410
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.240
I will head off now.

411
00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.810
Look after yourself, Sunbae.

412
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.260
People may not be tailing you, but many recognize you now.

413
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.450
What is okay?

414
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:48.890
I can't even get anything to go right. What is okay?

415
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:55.150
Nothing is okay.

416
00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:58.140
I am a complete wreck.

417
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:27.840
I hit my head on something.

418
00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.980
Why couldn't she just live a normal and relaxed life like them?

419
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:51.130
You must be busy with others things these days, yet I'm being troublesome again.

420
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.720
- Have another drink. 
 - Thank you, sir.

421
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.040
What do you mean, troublesome? Not at all.

422
00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.510
All I did was put in word for them to do as they're told.

423
00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:03.220
It's exactly as you mentioned before, right?

424
00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:07.670
In our country, whistleblowers who report

425
00:41:07.670 --> 00:41:13.530
internal issues such as borrowed-name funds and  accounting fraud

426
00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.670
are not eligible in keeping their anonymity protected.

427
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:18.830
What kind of law was made so perfectly?

428
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:22.680
I guess it would be difficult to do business

429
00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.600
if the country protected those who aren't loyal.

430
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.460
There are no plea bargains in our country either,

431
00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:35.010
so there's no way to negotiate with the prosecutor like they do in movies.

432
00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.060
One must follow the laws and regulations to be considered a developed country.

433
00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.080
Good work, Director Kim.

434
00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.310
- Give him another drink. 
 - Yes, sir.

435
00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:53.890
Sir, will it be okay to do that to your son-in-law?

436
00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:58.520
They say you have to raise your children with discipline.

437
00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.510
The same goes for a dog.

438
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:09.960
I was wondering how things were going.

439
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.510
We're going to remarry.

440
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.690
Did Yoon Ji Soo agree as well?

441
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:15.460
Of course.

442
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.600
I don't have a good feeling about this.

443
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.260
What are you talking about?

444
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.180
I think things are going the wrong direction.

445
00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:24.120
They'll bend back.

446
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:27.080
Do you fully trust Yoon Ji Soo?

447
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.240
I don't fully trust her, but I do fully know her.

448
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:35.400
Because she knows what she might lose, she won't try to resist.

449
00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.380
Is it... because of Jae Hyeon?

450
00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.190
I agreed to work with you because I was desperate, but I'm a little taken aback

451
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.670
but I'm a little taken aback by the kind of loving you do.

452
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:56.450
How can you live with someone who says they will give up their life for another man?

453
00:42:56.450 --> 00:43:02.090
I thought you of all people would understand.

454
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.960
Was I wrong?

455
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:09.230
Lee Se Hoon met with your wife.

456
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.630
- Seo Kyeong? 
 - Yes.

457
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:15.980
I thought the black box camera looked a little different,

458
00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.430
so I took a look at it...

459
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.790
<i>Spring, 2000</i>
 Where are we going today?

460
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.050
The delivery point.

461
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.220
Kyeonggido? You're taking a car, right?

462
00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.260
The subway.

463
00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.120
Are you trying to save transportations fees for meal later?

464
00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:06.560
You can't buy food to eat just because you have a bit of transportation fares left over.

465
00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.570
<i>Bundang</i>

466
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.580
What happened to your shoe?

467
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:23.820
How would I know?

468
00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.620
I told you I didn't want to ride the subway!

469
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.010
Where did you lose it?

470
00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.310
I don't know.

471
00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:34.040
I'm going to call Secretary Kim.

472
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.360
Where did you find it?

473
00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.510
Where did you lose it?

474
00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.660
I think it fell off as I was coming up the stairs.

What happened to your face?

477
00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.070
What's wrong with my face?

478
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:19.000

Everyone, fill your glasses.

481
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.700

483
00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.910
I'm not going to drink.

484
00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.630
- Drink it for her. 
 - What?

485
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.450
Okay, we'll skip Seo Kyeong and start from Jae Hyeon.

486
00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:46.650
That's not a wave then.

487
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:51.190
Seo Kyeong seems to be weak with alcohol, so drink it for her.

488
00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:43.260
You acted like you were a stickler to the rules, arguing that it wasn't a wave or whatever.

489
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.710
Is it okay for you to be out here like this during your work hours?

490
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:50.200
Staff dinners are an extension of your work.
