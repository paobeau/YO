WEBVTT

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.200
"Love is All"

00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.442
"Episode 13"

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.202
"Preceptor Tan in jail,
Tang Tian Yuan to her rescue"

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:02.751
You told me this drug
will only make him lose his voice.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.884
So why was Supernumerary Sun
killed by it?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.221
Silly girl.

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:12.796
Only the dead man...

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.639
tells no tale.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.871
You lied to me again.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.859
You promised not to kill innocents
before I was sent there.

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:23.522
But Sang Jie's servants
were all poisoned and killed!

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.440
To achieve greatness,
the price must be paid.

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:29.702
It's time for you...

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.259
to read the situation.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.175
Follow my lead...

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:35.144
and you will have success.

00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:37.409
We had a deal.

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.356
I was to be your spy
and not your assassin.

00:02:40.791 --> 00:02:42.240
You broke the agreement.

00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:44.462
I should just leave you.

00:02:44.642 --> 00:02:47.442
You can't even save your own neck.

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:48.783
From now on,

00:02:48.884 --> 00:02:50.866
I will never believe
another word from you.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.948
I will not do any of
your dirty biddings!

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.618
Stop!

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:59.217
You can throw your life away.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.582
However,

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.088
do you not care about the people...

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:05.787
from the District Bureau?

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:08.957
What do you mean?

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.640
I am merely taking orders from
someone above my rank.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.687
Who is that?

00:03:19.191 --> 00:03:22.251
You can get yourself killed
if you want.

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:24.370
However,

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:27.458
since Tang Fei Long and the others...

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.203
know so much information,

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.538
my superiors...

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:31.996
would want them silenced.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.881
Think about the consequences.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.578
Commissioner Zheng.

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:51.320
We welcome your presence.

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.102
If your boss starting a circus?

00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:00.404
I bet you didn't know.

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:02.881
They are trying to get used
to the stage.

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.059
Supernumerary Sun died in our premise.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.178
Our business has been slow.

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.629
So my Boss is trying to come up
with a new dance number.

00:04:10.458 --> 00:04:12.339
But with his sense of aesthetic,

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.893
I doubt Miao Sheng Parlour
will ever return to its grace.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.099
Where is Miss Ru Yi?

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.859
The business is slow.
My Boss is giving her a day off.

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:24.854
Okay.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.578
Boss.

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:35.435
Are you sure we could get
the business back on track?

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.539
Are you kidding me?
Of course we can.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.939
See? The girls are doing their best.

00:04:40.048 --> 00:04:41.705
I am their role model.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.779
Up.

00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:46.418
Here you are.

00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:47.871
I've been looking for you.

00:04:56.207 --> 00:04:57.447
Can you feel...

00:04:58.015 --> 00:04:59.447
my burning passion for you?

00:05:01.308 --> 00:05:02.706
Just take it out.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.218
Here. Eat it while it's warm.

00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:13.359
Please.

00:05:13.877 --> 00:05:15.199
Spare us some food.

00:05:16.258 --> 00:05:19.063
They live on the street
like stray animals.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.471
They barely have a decent meal
and live as drifters.

00:05:23.566 --> 00:05:25.180
There is no home or shelter.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:27.716
Why not choose death over life?

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:30.296
This is a dangerous thought
you have there.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.530
If everyone gives up on living,

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:35.578
they wouldn't get to enjoy...

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.000
the wonderful and special bond...

00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:39.549
that we share in this world.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.144
If one could barely survive,

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.263
bond and love means nothing.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:45.059
You see the world as a cold place.

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.158
But you underestimated
the power of bond.

00:05:53.965 --> 00:05:55.081
Look.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.676
Father, you should have this.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:58.819
-Some people...
-I don't need it.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.306
think enjoying the finest things
in life brings happiness.

00:06:02.096 --> 00:06:03.171
But look at them.

00:06:03.902 --> 00:06:05.491
The bun covered in filth...

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:07.947
is enough to put a smile
on the boy's face.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.561
You are pretty.

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:25.775
I wish I could...

00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:27.793
always stay by your side.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.155
And then...

00:06:30.696 --> 00:06:32.181
I can spend forever with you.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.971
Eat it while it's warm.

00:06:46.694 --> 00:06:47.866
Preceptor.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:50.874
We are here to purchase paper,
not for shopping.

00:06:51.744 --> 00:06:53.379
He is just being picky.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.959
He could use any paper.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.235
Why must he use this?

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.600
According to him,

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:00.219
the paper from
Cheng Xin Paper Store...

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.520
is very durable.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.341
With the ink he brought all
the way from the Capital,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.971
the writings will not fade
for another few decades.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:08.884
It's best for writing paperworks.

00:07:10.326 --> 00:07:11.387
Is that so?

00:07:12.178 --> 00:07:14.659
Can you differentiate
the paper quality...

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.456
from Cheng Xin Paper Store
from the others?

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:20.446
I can tell it apart from
the crude paper.

00:07:21.822 --> 00:07:23.703
Fine, enough about that.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:26.293
Get me a ride,
I can't walk any further.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.399
Preceptor, it's order
from Master Tang.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.819
Unless it's emergency,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.018
we cannot deploy the runner
for our chores.

00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:34.339
It's always Master Tang.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.937
You might as well marry him.

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.365
Get me a ride, I am paying.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:43.581
Okay!

00:07:48.119 --> 00:07:49.297
See you.

00:07:49.559 --> 00:07:50.686
Come again.

00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:55.800
<i>That man has a tattoo on his neck.</i>

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:07.567
Silence, come with me.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.857
Who are you?

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.476
Why were you following me?

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:15.242
Say it now!

00:08:15.679 --> 00:08:16.734
Otherwise I'll kill you.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.519
Now tell me who you are.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.939
I find the necklace
you wear very attractive.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.796
I am planning on getting one
for my lover.

00:08:28.129 --> 00:08:29.239
Let me have closer look.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:30.701
Why were you sneaking up on me?

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.450
I apologize.

00:08:34.359 --> 00:08:35.453
Let me have a look.

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:37.899
Don't touch my clothing!

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.220
Don't be so petty.
Let me have a look.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.818
Touch me again and you will be dead!

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:46.972
I am just taking a look,
I am not touching you.

00:08:53.119 --> 00:08:54.377
Now that you've seen it,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.964
perhaps...

00:08:57.679 --> 00:09:00.440
Perhaps we should
each go back to our homes.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:01.559
So long.

00:09:08.888 --> 00:09:10.035
Sir!

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.562
Sir, where are you?

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.938
I am right here.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:14.716
Sir!

00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:17.061
I have a huge lead on the case.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.058
I met a man with tattoo on his neck.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.047
It's the same tattoo found on
those bodied. They must be co-workers.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:24.371
Where?

00:09:24.902 --> 00:09:26.013
Right here.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.675
I mean which street.

00:09:29.679 --> 00:09:30.779
On the street south of the city.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.679
He looks mean, around 20 of age.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.395
He even threatened me with a blade.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.866
Luckily, I ran fast.

00:09:36.792 --> 00:09:38.687
Be patient. I will tell you.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.299
He has bushy brows.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.851
The brows are thick.

00:09:42.952 --> 00:09:44.415
Are you all right? Did he hurt you?

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.061
Did he hurt you?

00:09:47.535 --> 00:09:48.548
Hurt?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.865
No.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.068
Were you out of your mind?

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:56.446
You can't just approach an ex-convict.

00:09:57.159 --> 00:10:00.510
I didn't know for sure if he
was an ex-convict unless I approached.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:03.104
Are you sure you are fine?

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:05.880
I am the mighty Tan Ling Yin.
He couldn't have caught me.

00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:07.979
You were just lucky.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.822
It takes skills to be
as lucky as I am.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.451
Sir!

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.302
Sir!

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.419
Sir, a report from Chizhou.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.989
Miao Miao Sheng has been assassinated.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.152
Miao Miao Sheng?

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:28.542
I am dead?

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.373
Master Tang.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.258
Master Liu from Han Mo Printing...

00:10:48.359 --> 00:10:49.698
was assassinated last night.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.440
After our night long investigation,

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.465
we suspect the killer may be
hiding among your rank.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.143
We are here to apprehend the suspect.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.328
Old Liu?

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:00.970
Did you know him?

00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:03.403
I hired him to print my books.

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:06.559
This is absurd!

00:11:07.216 --> 00:11:08.754
We work as righteous officers,

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:10.387
we would never shelter a suspect!

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.935
That's right.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.939
Who do you think is the suspect?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.328
That would be Preceptor Tan.

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:18.919
Tan Ling Yin.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.320
-This is ridiculous!
-Nonsense!

00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:22.490
I killed no one!

00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:24.201
Why would she want the man dead?

00:11:25.958 --> 00:11:28.597
Tan Ling Yin was all out
of inspiration for her writing.

00:11:29.039 --> 00:11:31.661
So she hired the victim
to write her work.

00:11:32.119 --> 00:11:34.038
The two then had a dispute
because of payment.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:36.498
Master Liu refused to
write the books for her.

00:11:36.599 --> 00:11:38.256
He threatened to exposed her as fraud.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.058
Tan Ling Yin then chose a swift
way to silence the man.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.327
Sir, I didn't do anything.

00:11:44.318 --> 00:11:45.405
Master Tang.

00:11:46.119 --> 00:11:48.056
Please don't obstruct my duty.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.258
Please allow me to make the arrest.

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:51.772
You are now in Tongling.

00:11:51.983 --> 00:11:53.581
If you want to take her,

00:11:53.799 --> 00:11:55.159
it would be over our dead bodies!

00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:56.516
Sir.

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.471
Just give the order.

00:12:00.078 --> 00:12:01.368
Me and our brothers...

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.007
will use every bit of strength...

00:12:05.127 --> 00:12:07.345
to stop them from
taking Preceptor Tan.

00:12:12.574 --> 00:12:13.578
Stand down.

00:12:13.798 --> 00:12:15.663
-Sir?
-Stand down!

00:12:20.384 --> 00:12:21.583
Do you trust me?

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.079
Remember what I told you.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.600
As you wish.

00:12:36.799 --> 00:12:37.973
Much obliged.

00:13:12.376 --> 00:13:13.506
Let her go!

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.342
-Commissioner Zheng.
-Tan Ling Yin is now a suspect.

00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.130
We need to bring her in
for a trial.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.320
Should you obstruct our work,

00:13:23.743 --> 00:13:25.251
you shall be arrested as well.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.739
This is nonsense!

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:28.414
We have order from Lord Zong himself.

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:30.419
Any objection?

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.539
Of course!

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.158
She works here as our Preceptor.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.458
It's been a while
since I last put my blade to use.

00:13:35.559 --> 00:13:37.250
I should test my blades against yours!

00:13:37.749 --> 00:13:38.992
-Insolence!
-Commissioner Zheng.

00:13:40.415 --> 00:13:41.415
Stop.

00:13:42.246 --> 00:13:43.344
But...

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.339
This is merely their suspicion.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.561
Truth will prevail.

00:13:47.151 --> 00:13:48.711
Justice will never let me down.

00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:50.765
Don't be silly.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.359
Have you been into a prison?

00:13:52.487 --> 00:13:54.442
Do you know how they torture
to get information?

00:13:54.897 --> 00:13:55.899
A mere finger clamp...

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.651
can cripple your hands for good!

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.240
Furthermore,
you would be on Lord Zong's turf.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.900
Let go of Preceptor Tan!

00:14:04.719 --> 00:14:06.378
-Aide Zhou?
-Who are you?

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:08.698
-How dare you release our prisoner!
-I didn't mean to.

00:14:08.799 --> 00:14:10.809
You use your blade,
you can't deny it!

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:13.351
That's because I wanted
to reason with you.

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:15.258
The is no trial nor evidence yet
for the case.

00:14:15.359 --> 00:14:17.739
But you are putting shackles on
Preceptor Tan to walk the street.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.040
If she is proven innocent,
should I hold you accountable?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.280
That is how work is done
in the Prefecture Bureau.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.921
Arresting suspect and putting
shackles is part of protocols!

00:14:25.022 --> 00:14:26.167
And who set those protocols?

00:14:26.618 --> 00:14:28.378
No part of the laws in our land...

00:14:28.479 --> 00:14:31.075
has given authority the right to
put shackles on suspect before trial.

00:14:31.479 --> 00:14:33.018
Do you mean to say
His Majesty's law...

00:14:33.119 --> 00:14:35.152
can be bent because of
your Lord Zong from Chizhou?

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.659
He is right.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.018
Preceptor Tan is innocent.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.460
What if she is hurt during
the transport?

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.617
Every inch of her belongs
to the District Bureau.

00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:46.227
If you lay a finger on her,
you'll pay for it!

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:49.778
Commissioner Zheng, I am not an item.

00:14:49.911 --> 00:14:50.941
Shut it.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.935
We could strike
a better deal with them.

00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:55.199
I am not going to argue with you.

00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:58.360
When this girl is
convicted for her crime,

00:14:58.719 --> 00:15:01.062
when her head is hanging by
the Prefecture Bureau,

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.510
you would have nothing more to say.

00:15:04.316 --> 00:15:05.330
Press on!

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:07.618
Commissioner Zheng.

00:15:15.723 --> 00:15:18.334
Commissioner Zheng,
if you were arrested too,

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.200
we'll have no one to rescue her.

00:15:20.511 --> 00:15:21.524
You are right.

00:15:21.625 --> 00:15:23.831
Old Tang must be worried.
I need to talk to him.

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:29.822
Tang Tian Yuan, you heartless wretch!

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.777
Hand over the knife. And remember,

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:34.248
I am Tang Fei Long.

00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:38.378
Lord Zong has taken Preceptor Tan
as his prisoner.

00:15:39.159 --> 00:15:41.531
Now is not the time for you
to be preparing meal!

00:15:42.087 --> 00:15:43.129
The knife.

00:15:43.368 --> 00:15:44.380
No.

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.719
Miao Miao Sheng was killed.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.669
And Miao Miao Sheng
was arrested for that.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.007
This is intriguing.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.344
Are you seriously considering this
as your payback?

00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:01.018
Is this because...

00:16:01.198 --> 00:16:02.919
she wrote about you in her books?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.317
So you won't go to her rescue?

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:06.339
Fine. If you won't, I will.

00:16:06.558 --> 00:16:07.615
Come back here.

00:16:10.295 --> 00:16:12.373
You know they come prepared.

00:16:13.359 --> 00:16:16.379
The moment Zong Ying Lin left
a murder took place.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.192
He is clearing trying to
prove his point.

00:16:21.698 --> 00:16:25.000
But it's clear to him you are
going up against him.

00:16:25.101 --> 00:16:26.712
Why would he bother to blackmail you?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.277
This is his warning for us.

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:30.159
He wants us to stop investigating.

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:33.196
But Preceptor Tan...

00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:35.400
could be taken out on his turf.

00:16:35.501 --> 00:16:38.718
Or maybe you could reveal
your identity and cover up the case.

00:16:39.287 --> 00:16:40.666
I must disagree with your plan.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.179
Only by keeping my identity
hidden from him...

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.947
can I get more information.

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:49.669
You can't reveal your true identity.

00:16:51.607 --> 00:16:53.422
But there are all sorts of
torture devices there.

00:16:54.571 --> 00:16:56.618
There are rats and cockroaches.

00:16:58.798 --> 00:17:01.900
Preceptor Tan is but a girl.
How could you let her...

00:17:02.479 --> 00:17:03.484
be in there?

00:17:04.479 --> 00:17:05.738
How could you leave her there?

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.613
You should go to her rescue.

00:17:08.654 --> 00:17:09.735
Are you even...

00:17:12.368 --> 00:17:13.398
Where are you going?

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.799
"Tongling District Bureau"

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.750
Commissioner Zheng.

00:17:30.137 --> 00:17:31.779
Commissioner Zheng,
where are you going?

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.440
To rescue Preceptor Tan from Chizhou.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.319
Thank you for helping just now.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.802
You freed her from those shackles.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.099
What gave you the courage for that?

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.779
She is one of us.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.299
I can't let them mistreat her.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.953
It's my duty to deal with injustice.

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:48.117
You are right. We must never left
anyone of us behind, not matter what.

00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:51.581
-I am leaving now.
-Hold on.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:56.659
Master Tang seems to be still working
on paperworks for today.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.550
Are you two going on
separate missions?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.606
He is just too hesitant.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.392
I would be gone for a few days.

00:18:03.493 --> 00:18:05.301
I should say goodbye to your cousin.

00:18:07.277 --> 00:18:08.335
Stop!

00:18:10.319 --> 00:18:11.388
What's wrong?

00:18:13.247 --> 00:18:16.040
She told me she is having
an appointment today.

00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:17.820
She might not have the time
to see you.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.396
She has a date?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
With who?

00:18:21.968 --> 00:18:23.931
I need to have a word with
that liar Zhu Da Cong.

00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:25.579
I paid him the deposit,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.041
he can't ask her to
serve the customers!

00:18:27.142 --> 00:18:29.088
Commissioner Zheng?

00:18:45.978 --> 00:18:47.819
Come on, have a seat inside!

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.070
Some again next time.

00:18:50.199 --> 00:18:51.338
Er Tong.

00:18:51.439 --> 00:18:53.362
What is taking you so long
to serve the food?

00:18:53.463 --> 00:18:55.483
Here it comes.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:57.991
-Sit down.
-Okay.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.368
Dig in.

00:19:00.579 --> 00:19:01.939
It's been a long day for you too.

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.101
Zhu Da Cong!

00:19:05.961 --> 00:19:07.166
-Shao Feng?
-Get up!

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:11.138
What is it that got you so anxious?

00:19:11.239 --> 00:19:13.618
I paid you the deposit,
I told you I will pay for her deed.

00:19:13.726 --> 00:19:15.526
Why did you let her serve other men?

00:19:16.064 --> 00:19:18.579
But, I didn't do that.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.119
All the ladies in my premise...

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.179
have the right to
pick their own customers.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.235
If she does want to
serve the customers,

00:19:24.336 --> 00:19:25.350
it's none of my business.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.330
She has the right to set
a pursuit for her career.

00:19:27.492 --> 00:19:28.618
I won't allow that!

00:19:28.719 --> 00:19:31.053
From now on, she will serve
no other men, do you hear me?

00:19:31.154 --> 00:19:32.179
Commissioner Zheng.

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.618
I am running a legal business.

00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:36.770
She can at least have dinner
or a chat with them.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.913
No way!

00:19:38.479 --> 00:19:39.896
Where is she now?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.816
I have no idea.

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.927
And even if she is indeed serving
a guy that you don't like,

00:19:45.239 --> 00:19:46.518
well do you see the exit?

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.098
outside of that door,

00:19:49.199 --> 00:19:50.584
you are the fearsome Commissioner.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.848
-Enjoy.
-Fine, carry on with your dinner.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.590
-Goodbye.
-One more thing,

00:19:54.712 --> 00:19:56.671
Preceptor Tan is now a suspect
of a murder case.

00:19:56.772 --> 00:19:57.934
so stop eating.

00:19:58.407 --> 00:19:59.596
You really are worthless.

00:20:20.405 --> 00:20:21.540
Miss Ru Yi?

00:20:22.502 --> 00:20:23.707
Miss Ru Yi?

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.509
Miss Ru Yi?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.536
I saw nothing.
I didn't see anything.

00:20:40.199 --> 00:20:42.071
So this is the respect
you have for me?

00:20:42.599 --> 00:20:45.096
Do you think you could just
rush into my room...

00:20:45.197 --> 00:20:46.665
because of the work I do?

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:49.038
I am here because of
an urgent matter.

00:20:49.439 --> 00:20:50.803
I heard from your cousin.

00:20:51.104 --> 00:20:53.321
You have a date today.

00:20:53.928 --> 00:20:57.372
I just want to see who that man is.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.876
My date has nothing to do with you.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.871
I am a dancer.
I am not your pet.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.295
I can see whoever I want.

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.502
Miss Ru Yi, I didn't mean
to upset you.

00:21:09.808 --> 00:21:12.827
I was anxious so I got reckless.

00:21:15.007 --> 00:21:17.684
If you would be just as reckless
in the future,

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.922
the perhaps we should stop
seeing each other.

00:21:20.023 --> 00:21:21.180
Please, no.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.505
I will leave you be.

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:29.990
Miss Ru Yi.

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:32.506
I am going to Chizhou.

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:35.136
I am here to let you know
I might be away for some time.

00:21:36.119 --> 00:21:37.980
I know that you might not...

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.441
care much about me leaving.

00:21:40.047 --> 00:21:41.896
But I want you to know.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.256
No matter where I am,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.243
I can't let you worry.

00:22:34.831 --> 00:22:36.427
Maybe I should quit this job.

00:22:49.899 --> 00:22:51.832
I am a female Preceptor.

00:22:51.956 --> 00:22:53.397
I need a personal bodyguard.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.073
Don't you worry.

00:23:03.959 --> 00:23:05.430
I will bring her back...

00:23:05.896 --> 00:23:07.034
safe and sound.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.569
Master Tang, do you really have to
rescue Preceptor Tan?

00:23:17.319 --> 00:23:18.691
I asked around.

00:23:19.055 --> 00:23:20.786
On the night Master Liu died,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.779
there is no alibi...

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.523
that can help prove her innocence.

00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:27.899
What if she really is the killer?

00:23:28.213 --> 00:23:30.419
She would be executed
even if you go.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.792
She is not the killer.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.130
Master Tang, you can't judge
a book by its cover.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.019
Even if she is innocent,

00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:40.800
if you make a fuss at Chizhou
for Lord Zong,

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.581
your action would offend him.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.138
If you were to do it for her,

00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:47.705
it wouldn't be worth it...

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.461
to ruin your own career.

00:23:55.007 --> 00:23:56.451
Who told you to say that?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.976
No one, no one asked me to.

00:24:01.084 --> 00:24:03.944
I was merely concerned
for your safety.

00:24:05.173 --> 00:24:06.249
Master Tang.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:09.753
You are destined for a place
far greater than Tongling.

00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:13.088
We will return to the Capital
sooner or later.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.957
There is no need for you to waste
any time and effort for an outsider.

00:24:17.239 --> 00:24:19.326
Xiang Gua, I want you
to listen closely.

00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:22.312
Tan Ling Yin is more than
just a mere outsider for me.

00:24:23.287 --> 00:24:24.672
For the first time in my life,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.794
I wanted to be with someone.

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.664
It's dinner time.

00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:22.298
<i>My bride, hang in there.</i>

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.798
Now is not the time for tea!

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.378
My bride is eating dirt
for dinner in prison cell.

00:25:27.479 --> 00:25:29.498
How could I have the mood
to enjoy this feast?

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:31.579
-Is the money ready?
-Everything is ready.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.779
The carriage is ready too.

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:33.983
Nicely done.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.258
I've told her before.

00:25:36.359 --> 00:25:39.014
She shouldn't be working in
the public's eyes.

00:25:39.115 --> 00:25:40.539
But she wouldn't listen.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.098
She insisted on writing those books.

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.210
Now she gets to be
in a storyline herself.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.920
Instead of making money
from writing books,

00:25:47.094 --> 00:25:49.174
she might as well just bribe
the officers of Chizhou.

00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:53.338
It will end in three months.
Three months from now,

00:25:53.439 --> 00:25:55.204
She will have to marry me anyway.

00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:58.241
Master Zhu.

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.738
Brother, why are you here?

00:26:00.839 --> 00:26:03.460
My sister is taken to prison
in Chizhou, I must rescue her.

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:05.160
But it's the middle of the night,

00:26:05.261 --> 00:26:06.819
I can't get any transportation.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.362
-Lend me a carriage...
-No, you mustn't go.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.898
Not only will it not help her,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.018
they might take you as hostage...

00:26:14.119 --> 00:26:15.536
and use you against your sister.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.190
I am going to Chizhou
to strike a deal and get her out.

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:19.459
This time,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.378
I will spend all the coins I have
to get her out of there.

00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:24.721
What if the Governor won't
accept your bribe money?

00:26:25.258 --> 00:26:26.498
We just need to prove...

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:28.338
my sister wrote those books
with her own hands,

00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:31.347
that will negate all the allegations
that are against her.

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:34.179
I have some drafts and documents
from my sister.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.867
These should be enough as evidences.

00:26:36.239 --> 00:26:37.779
I wanted to hand these
over to Master Tang.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.319
But both he and Commissioner Zheng
left this evening.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.532
Wait.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.183
Tang Fei Long has already left?

00:26:43.284 --> 00:26:44.352
Yes.

00:26:46.781 --> 00:26:48.041
Brother.

00:26:48.239 --> 00:26:51.218
I'll bring your sister back to you...

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.630
safe and sound!

00:26:53.477 --> 00:26:55.531
Er Tong, watch the house for me.

00:27:00.098 --> 00:27:03.110
Master Tang and Ling
has gone through so much...

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.915
before they finally found
the corpses of that family.

00:27:08.359 --> 00:27:09.419
Have a guess.

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:13.136
Where were the bodies hidden?

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.124
Under the ground at the yard?

00:27:16.439 --> 00:27:19.159
That is silly, chop the bodies up
and hide them in a wine cellar.

00:27:19.712 --> 00:27:20.971
That is too much gore.

00:27:21.072 --> 00:27:22.451
Ignore him. Keep going.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.858
Where were the corpses?

00:27:23.959 --> 00:27:25.094
Tell us.

00:27:26.319 --> 00:27:28.534
While Master Tang thought
he met an dead end,

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.347
Ling led him into
the house of the victims.

00:27:37.878 --> 00:27:41.373
Ling took a hammer and
tore down the whole wall.

00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:43.905
Do you know what was behind the wall?

00:27:44.006 --> 00:27:45.978
-What?
-Behind the wall?

00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:48.174
-Gold?
-Don't be a miser.

00:27:49.959 --> 00:27:51.226
Behind the wall...

00:27:51.327 --> 00:27:53.607
were five mutilated bodies.

00:27:55.363 --> 00:27:57.018
The constable...

00:27:57.119 --> 00:27:59.072
dug out the bodies one by one.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.369
A red thread was found on
four of the bodies,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.508
except for the body of a girl.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.098
Her face was heavily decomposed.

00:28:06.199 --> 00:28:07.360
She didn't have a red thread.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.513
-How did that happen?
-She lost it?

00:28:10.914 --> 00:28:12.747
-I don't know.
-Do you want to find out?

00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:14.996
-Yes.
-Bring me roasted chicken tomorrow.

00:28:15.097 --> 00:28:16.409
Yes, as you wish.

00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:18.499
Now,

00:28:19.608 --> 00:28:21.549
Ling walked towards Master Tang.

00:28:26.897 --> 00:28:28.073
"Master Tang."

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.918
"Are you looking for this thread?"

00:28:34.152 --> 00:28:36.517
What? Don't push me!

00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:41.660
Tell us another story.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.901
I am going to bed.

00:28:46.319 --> 00:28:47.586
Tell us another story.

00:28:48.932 --> 00:28:51.000
All right, clean up the place.

00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:56.959
Old man?

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.971
Sir, are you okay?

00:28:59.597 --> 00:29:00.672
Sir?

00:29:08.958 --> 00:29:10.040
Boss.

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.800
May I ask you something?

00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:13.075
What is it?

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.467
How is the sales of
"Tang Fei Long Mysteries"...

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:17.959
around this place?

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.191
It's well received.

00:29:19.292 --> 00:29:20.655
The books are always sold out.

00:29:22.599 --> 00:29:25.713
Did you know Master Liu
from Han Mo Printing?

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.618
He was best known as a miser.

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:29.168
He was petty and liked to boast.

00:29:29.536 --> 00:29:31.335
He thought he was only beneath
Miao Miao Sheng...

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:32.801
because of his age.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.978
He was a writer too?

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.498
That was many years ago.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.568
But nothing he wrote was remarkable.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.880
No one read it.

00:29:40.649 --> 00:29:42.364
That Master Liu was a writer too?

00:29:42.839 --> 00:29:44.082
This complicates things for us.

00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:47.939
The storylines of the books
are based on our personal experience.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.382
Master Liu would have known any of it.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.332
Which means he was just a scapegoat.

00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:55.539
What do we do now?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.788
Preceptor Tan's trial is
two days from now.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.632
Time is running out.
Let's split up.

00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:05.111
-Sir.
-Who are you?

00:30:05.479 --> 00:30:06.800
I am the Preceptor of Tongling.

00:30:06.901 --> 00:30:08.155
Preceptor?

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.295
-Yes.
-You have to save me.

00:30:10.743 --> 00:30:13.477
I worked as a cook
for the Sang family.

00:30:14.887 --> 00:30:16.258
It was you who survived?

00:30:17.031 --> 00:30:19.936
They only spared my life because...

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.498
they want to know...

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:23.172
if Master Sang...

00:30:23.273 --> 00:30:25.928
left any clue that could
lead to the gold mine.

00:30:28.154 --> 00:30:29.498
I know nothing.

00:30:29.721 --> 00:30:31.819
Master Sang only told him.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:33.046
Who is he?

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:45.187
Sir?

00:30:45.765 --> 00:30:46.782
Sir?

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.184
Sir? Wake up!

00:31:09.894 --> 00:31:12.171
"Han Mo Printing"

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.840
Old Liu and I had known each other
for a long time.

00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:36.891
After I learned of his passing,

00:31:37.079 --> 00:31:38.955
I came here right away.

00:31:39.591 --> 00:31:40.751
My condolences.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.419
We didn't invite anyone
to the funeral.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:46.805
May I know how you learned
of his passing?

00:31:48.319 --> 00:31:50.452
I hired him to print
scriptures for me.

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.256
I come here every month.

00:31:53.018 --> 00:31:54.218
But this time,

00:31:54.319 --> 00:31:55.671
he was late for days.

00:31:56.336 --> 00:31:58.674
I was worried so I wanted
to check on him.

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:02.239
He also mentioned you a lot.

00:32:02.824 --> 00:32:04.417
I wish to pay you a visit...

00:32:04.887 --> 00:32:06.687
and have some catching up
with both of you.

00:32:07.839 --> 00:32:09.209
I see.

00:32:12.479 --> 00:32:13.617
Madam.

00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:15.779
The long journey made me thirsty.

00:32:16.735 --> 00:32:18.306
Could I have some water?

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:21.603
Pardon me, I'll get you some water.

00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:02.100
Have you heard?

00:33:02.287 --> 00:33:05.254
Miao Miao Sheng has been assassinated!

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:09.160
-Really?
-He is dead?

00:33:09.319 --> 00:33:11.138
Miao Miao Sheng is living in Tongling.

00:33:11.239 --> 00:33:12.359
What is this nonsense?

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.699
That girl from Tongling...

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.378
is nothing more than a fraud!

00:33:16.479 --> 00:33:17.659
No way!

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.404
Her books were all
written by Master Liu!

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.809
which is why the Miao Miao Sheng
that died in Chizhou...

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.751
was the real Miao Miao Sheng!

00:33:27.018 --> 00:33:28.098
I heard about it too.

00:33:28.199 --> 00:33:29.459
The books became so popular.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.618
Old Man Liu got upset.

00:33:30.719 --> 00:33:32.179
He was asking for more payment.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.978
He and Miao Miao Sheng fought...

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.179
and he was killed.

00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:37.748
The officers even
arrested the fake Miao Miao Sheng.

00:33:38.576 --> 00:33:39.579
You...

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.323
You are a bunch of ignorant fools!

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.359
Who do you think you are?

00:33:44.098 --> 00:33:46.916
That old man was
the real fraud around.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.539
The real Miao Miao Sheng...

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.191
was framed and taken
to the prison of Chizhou!

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:53.338
-Don't be ridiculous!
-Nonsense!

00:33:53.439 --> 00:33:54.659
Come down here!

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:57.578
What makes you think all she wrote
all the books by herself?

00:33:57.679 --> 00:33:58.726
You are not her.

00:33:58.827 --> 00:34:00.573
-That's right!
-I am not her,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.210
however...

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.173
the main character...

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.439
was based on me.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.879
-Who are you?
-Who this creepy man?

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:10.274
Get down!

00:34:11.939 --> 00:34:12.939
Don't hit me!

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.428
I am the real Zhu Da Cong.

00:34:16.659 --> 00:34:17.739
Shao Feng!

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.328
Let's go!

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.879
Stop hitting me!

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.272
Run!

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.015
Now is not the time to have tea!

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.459
Are you and Master Tang really here
to rescue my bride?

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.591
Her trial is tomorrow.

00:34:32.479 --> 00:34:34.618
How are you supposed to save her?

00:34:35.439 --> 00:34:37.700
Listen, I have a plan.

00:34:38.399 --> 00:34:40.580
Except for Lord Zong the Governor,

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.993
with all the people
in charge around here,

00:34:44.298 --> 00:34:46.899
there will be twelve people I must pay
with 20 taels of silver each.

00:34:47.005 --> 00:34:49.203
And 500 taels for the Governor.

00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:52.145
The total is 740 taels of silver.
That settles it.

00:34:52.768 --> 00:34:55.505
Do you really think money
can solve anything?

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.475
Wasn't that enough?

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.538
My father is the Governor of Jinan,

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:01.258
this is the best I can offer.

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.939
What Zong Ying Lin wants...

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.086
is not your money, it's her life.

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.784
Are you serious?

00:35:07.552 --> 00:35:10.450
An corrupted officer who wants
to kill rather than money?

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.250
Now is not the time for you
to enjoy reading love novels!

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.120
Because of officers like you,

00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:20.785
the agencies have become inefficient.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.494
Bring them up here.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.600
We need them to prove
Preceptor Tan innocent.

00:35:24.701 --> 00:35:27.516
Okay, you should have told me.

00:35:30.159 --> 00:35:33.601
They are Miao Miao Sheng's
manuscripts from previous works.

00:35:33.702 --> 00:35:36.319
But they come with hefty price.

00:35:37.959 --> 00:35:39.155
Hefty price?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.981
Since it's hefty, how much is it?

00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:46.858
Now that Miao Miao Sheng is in jail,

00:35:46.959 --> 00:35:49.801
there won't be any of her books
in the future.

00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:52.118
So this is worth at least 50 taels.

00:35:53.858 --> 00:35:55.267
50 taels of silver?

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.177
A scam, this is a scam!

00:35:59.593 --> 00:36:01.353
Bargain for better price.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.919
I want you to humiliate him.

00:36:03.399 --> 00:36:04.548
Sure.

00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:08.282
Boss.

00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:13.979
When I first started
my illegal business,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.178
you were nothing more than an amateur.

00:36:17.479 --> 00:36:19.062
Trying to scam me?

00:36:19.163 --> 00:36:20.438
You have a lot more to learn.

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:22.406
Do you know who I am?

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:25.108
I am the son of Governor Zhu You Neng.

00:36:25.538 --> 00:36:26.939
When they talk about corruption,

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.333
they mean me.

00:36:30.239 --> 00:36:31.818
Those counterfeit with colour,

00:36:31.919 --> 00:36:33.226
those are fine.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.818
Commissioner Zheng, search the drawer
under his counter.

00:36:37.919 --> 00:36:39.199
You are sure to find something good.

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.823
-Okay.
-Please, don't!

00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:42.739
Commissioner Zheng, please.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.338
The price is not a problem.

00:36:44.439 --> 00:36:45.503
Five taels.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.277
At least ten taels.
I am running a small business.

00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:50.699
Commissioner Zheng.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.699
Check the compartment
under his shelves.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.014
There could be some antiques.

00:36:54.115 --> 00:36:55.167
Sure.

00:36:55.268 --> 00:36:57.338
Fine, five taels.

00:36:57.439 --> 00:36:59.001
Okay, you have a deal.

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:00.916
Here is the money.

00:37:01.222 --> 00:37:02.280
Thank you.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.659
I saved you earlier.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.082
That makes us even now. Goodbye.

00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:10.775
No, you saved 45 taels thanks to me.

00:37:11.259 --> 00:37:12.338
Besides,

00:37:12.439 --> 00:37:14.858
if you are rescuing my bride,
just count me in.

00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:17.457
This is not a field trip,
we don't need you.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.378
I have the money.

00:37:20.479 --> 00:37:21.612
You have the strength.

00:37:21.713 --> 00:37:22.807
He has the brain.

00:37:22.908 --> 00:37:25.951
The three of us make
a great team together.

00:37:26.052 --> 00:37:28.660
You should have some walnut
to boost your brain function.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.909
If you let me join your cause,

00:37:32.496 --> 00:37:33.790
should Miss Ru Yi...

00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:35.595
have any dance performance,

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:38.160
you get the front row seat.

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:42.945
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:46.238
Wait for me.
