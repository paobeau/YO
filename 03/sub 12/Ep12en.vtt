I...

25
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.720
My progress will come out soon.

26
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:17.360
If the result isn't good, six months or a year, I'll keep trying until I succeed.

27
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.850
But you dislike babies, don't you?

28
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.080
I was trying to dislike them.

29
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.760
Because I fought and lost to a baby.

30
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.250
From now on, since it'll be difficult,

31
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.540
whether we forgo a baby and just love,

32
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.390
or get a procedure done after marrying,

33
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.710
we will need to have uncomfortable conversations.

34
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:10.110
We will need to bring up painful conversations and our pride will be hurt and we will want to avoid it.

35
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.230
We may fight, and at some moments, we will want to give up.

Are you scared?

37
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.830
Yes.

38
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:34.440
Although you said we should try and find a solution together, something like a miracle may not exist.

39
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.340
You may have to go through another painful moment.

40
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.110
Will you really be okay with that?

41
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.850
Even so, let's not lose.

42
00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:01.180
It's an unfair fight where the woman has a harder time than the man.

43
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.860
Even if we lose together, you'll hurt more than I will.

44
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.330
So make sure to win. Because I also won't lose.

45

Mom, are you going to sleep?

48
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.330
Why? Are you here to brag about your date with Han Yisang?

49
00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.990
He's "Han Yisang" for you? Same here.

50
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.400
What should I call him then?

51
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.840
You said "my son-in-law."

52
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.130
It just came out. I haven't given you permission yet.

53
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.200
He seems like an okay person.

54
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.060
Don't throw yourself in marriage just because you're rushing to have a baby.

55
00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.750
What do you mean "throw myself"? It's not like I'm a fighter.

56
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.390
You never really know someone. You can't tell even when you live with them.

57
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.650
It's a honeymoon period where he can look cool even with a horn on his forehead, so keep your eyes peeled.

58
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:40.440
If anything makes you think it might cause you to suffer, just coldly cut him loose.

59
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.150
Okay?

60
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.410
Cut loose what?

61
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.590
Why is your answer so weak?

62
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.710
Does Han Yisang have a problem?

63
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.000
No, he's not that type of person.

64
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.920
How could you possibly see straight right now? I have to take a good look.

65
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:05.700
You have to get married right away, so I need to think about which one would be better.

66
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.720
"Which one?"

67
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:17.430
I'm just saying I'm going to pick my son-in-law well.

68
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.080
Then don't try to dig up everything and just look at him kindly.

69
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.300

She's been going to work early ever since she became the Chief Editor.

73

No, I came here to exercise with you.

 - Yes.

You just need to consistently love Hari till the end.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:14.620
Out of all the things I can do for Hari,

78
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.200
I am most confident in that. You don't have to worry.

79

Oh my, you. It's not like that.

"Our Han Yisang?"

82
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.500
Oh my. Did I... say that?

83
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.820
Why did I? He's not "ours" yet.

84
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:44.360
Yeah, well. You two have fun.

85

I understand you're doing this to gain my favor,

99
00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:45.110
but doing this at my workplace is very troublesome.

100
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.390
- I'm sorry. 
 - Aunt.

101

Hari and I are in a loving relationship.

You're so thick-faced.

106
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.860
Can you not determine that you're not it for her?

107

Even if insults are hurled at me and I'm childish and thick-faced,

Oh, you're such a romantic!

110
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.370
Aunt, he's...

111
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.430
That's...

112
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.260
Never mind.

113
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:31.900
You need to think that it's a really big relief that I'm a classy person.

114
00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:33.380
I'm against him.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:36.270
Really? Then you stay by her side and watch over her.

116
00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.030
So that he treats Hari well even if it's because of you.

117
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:39.630

What's that?

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.960
Some kind of a dog?

120
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.180
It's not a dog!

121
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.500
Anyway, Aunt, just because Hari is in a rush does not mean she should just choose anybody.

122
00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.020
I'll be frank here.

123
00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:59.000
To be honest, for Hari, neither of you are good enough.

124

You she fell for quickly because she couldn't find a decent man at her age.

How can you tell what a person's really like by seeing them once or twice? Only time will tell.

126
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:12.650
Yes, that's right. You are one hundred times correct.

127
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.430
- I will— 
 - You, besides being a doctor, what's so great about you? Because you're like family,

128
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:21.250
I was thinking about the two of you together since I have affection for you.

129
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.140
Aunt, are you going to betray me like this?

130
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.740
I... have so many good qualities.

131
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:34.360
When I'm in front of you like this,

132
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.700
considering another man so bluntly is a bit...

133
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.900
- I know it's two-timing, but I don't know what will happen with you. 
 - That's right.

134
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.500
Hari's feelings are her own.

135
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:50.150
In my heart, Jaeyoung, you are still a contender.

136
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.790
Aunt...

137
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.900
It's not like I don't like you both.

138
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.650
Give me some time.

139
00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.150
Who I will pick, I'm so torn!

140
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.840
Oh my goodness.

141
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:23.140
Dr. Yoon... thank you.

142
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.790
Don't be thankful. I haven't given up.

143
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.520
Oh, this!

144
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.690
Senior, what is that?

145
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.210
My mom keeps sending herbal tonics to me and telling me to have a baby.

146
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:42.500
My god, I'm going crazy.

147
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:46.020
You said your mother-in-law isn't like that, so it's your mom that does it?

148
00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.120
When I'm choosing not to have a baby, I don't know why my mom is the guilty one.

149
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.490
Oh, the predicament of the DINK couple. 
 <i>(T/N: DINK -  "double income, no kids".)</i>

150
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.440
My work is my own. Are we going to the workshop?

151
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.240
I submitted the proposal, but it hasn't been approved yet.

152
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.920
When it's this weekend?

153
00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.830
Isn't the weekend not a good time?

154
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:07.550
We need to have fun...

155
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:10.930
But you need to work during the weekday, no?

156
00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:15.020
I'll look into the workshop. You don't need anything confirmed?

157
00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:16.640
I'm going outside for some work.

158
00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.290
Okay, see you later.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.040
See you.

160
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.770
Yes, come in.

161
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.890
Why are you here?

162
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.690
I'm here for a checkup.

163
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.800
Are you a baby?

164
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:51.770
Are you really sick? Why?

165
00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:01.200
I have prickly pain in my heart. I wonder why.

166
00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.950
Do you have some sort of a heart worm?

167
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.950
I'm saying I'm thankful.

168
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.400
While being beside a friend who's having a dramatic dating life,

169
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:25.610
getting frustrated and telling me things I don't want to hear, and worrying about it like it's your own issue...

170
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.710
you're suffering a lot, too.

171
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.110
Thank you also for not telling Mom.

172
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:40.590
Never in my life did I think I would hear you say thank you to me.

173
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.450
But to be honest, I've never liked that jerk since the beginning.

174
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.130
Do you have to go the hard route?

175
00:14:56.410 --> 00:14:58.210
Jaeyoung,

176
00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.870
I really like him.

177
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.680
I don't want to let him go.

178
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.040
I'll try my best to follow this path well,

179
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.900
so don't worry and watch over me.

180
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.850
What are you going to do? Did you give up on a baby?

181
00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.140
You wanted one.

182
00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.760
Is it even possible to give that up?

183
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:40.320
I may give up.

184
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.450
We're going to try and find a solution together.

185
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:47.980
I'm going to go.

186
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:53.260
Jang Hari, put this on.

187
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.640
Why?

188
00:16:01.930 --> 00:16:04.170
How's my heartbeat?

189
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:10.990
Hey, why is it so angry? Your heart is livid.

190
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.090
Yeah, I'm angry.

191
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.140
Because of you.

192
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.760
<i>[love]</i>

193
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.400
How old are you?

194
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.580
Four years old.

195
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.410
Four years old? What's your name?

196
00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:02.940
Lee Roeun.

197
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.790
Lee Roeun?

198
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.350
You're pretty.

199
00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.130
Lee Roeun.

200
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.160
<i> [Hello. I am Nemson Company's hiring manager. Thank you for applying at our career recruitment headquarters. We had many applicants for this screening,] </i>

201
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.870
<i> [so I inevitably was unable to meet with you. It is not because you are lacking, so please don't be disappointed...] </i>

202
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.650
Honey, should we buy a dishwasher?

203
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:30.470
It's not because I don't want to do the dishes but because you're tired.

204
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:32.010
Don't fight.

205
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.420
Honey, we're all out of dishwashing soap.

206
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:37.370
Clean with baking soda.

207
00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:43.100
Oh, okay. Wait, here it is.

208
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.070
Honey. H-Honey, where are you going?

209
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:10.640
Honey!

210
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.970
You came here after leaving home?

211
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:28.100
What is it? Hyeonseok made side dishes, looked after the kids, and cleaned up,

212
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.110
but you left, I heard.

213
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.010
Look over there.

214
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.170
Dark circles appearing over makeup, working so hard until your eyes turn red...

215
00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.670
Isn't it really romantic?

216
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:46.300
What is it? What idiotic company

217
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:51.800
passed over our hidden-talent Kim Eunyoung who will advance this country's IT industry?

218
00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.010
I submitted 50 resumes, but they won't hire me even for a basic office job.

219
00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:03.360
How could one empty slot on my resume discredit my entire resume?

220
00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.470
What about you? Are you okay?

221
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:15.920
I can't avoid thinking about a baby, but I'm still happy.

222
00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.900
I'm so jealous.

223
00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.690
It's a big deal, but don't try to come to a decision now and keep dating.

224
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.380
It'll turn out well.

225
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.570
Thank you.

226
00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.930
It'll turn out well for you, too.

227
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.490
I don't want to live like this.

228
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.340
But I feel like I am going to.

229
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:53.340
How do you know that? When I don't know what I'm going to eat tomorrow morning.

230
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:57.230
I know. I'm going to eat the leftovers from my kids.

231
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:03.290
No. You're going to eat what I make. Although I don't know what it'll be.

232
00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:10.730
Get up. I told your husband you're sleeping at my house today. Let's go.

233
00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.810
Where are you?

234
00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:20.410
You didn't come to the studio. Is something going on?

235
00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.260
I'm doing very important work right now.

236
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.300
What work?

237
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.700
<i> [Pride of Tteokbokki] </i>

238
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.000
I'm standing my future up right now.

239
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:38.840
Soocheol?

240
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.050
Yeah? Oh, you shocked me!

241
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.110
What are you doing here?

242
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.390
Important work.

243
00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:55.850
Park Yunho.

244
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.350
- Yes? 
 - What are you doing here?

245
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.760
Are you booked up? Let me sleep over tonight, too.

246
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:06.770
Is it the night of the free wives?

247
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:13.060
Have you seen each other? Over here is my friend Kim Eunyoung and over here is my junior Park Yunho.

248
00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.710
Married women who have run away from home, come in.

249
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.190
Wow. Is that cheese?

250
00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:28.990
Wow.

251
00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.680
Eat it.

252
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.710
This place has a lot of customers.

253
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.330
I thought it might be good for a side business, so I'm going to be an intern here.

254
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.240
Do you have the money for it?

255
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.850
I'll need to get a loan. The studio alone makes me nervous.

256
00:21:57.590 --> 00:22:00.140
What? You guys made up?

257
00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.720
Hari said it's okay?

258
00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.630
It may become more difficult than how it is now,

259
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.060
but thankfully she grabbed onto me.

260
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.000
I will have to make an effort with the hope that everything will be okay.

261
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.130
But do you also want a baby?

262
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.930
You said there was no baby in your life.

263
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.230
Because Hari wants one,

264
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:32.850
I want to dream of one together.

265
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.900
A dream...

266
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.640
where I become a father.

267
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.260
Brother,

268
00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.980
before becoming a father,

269
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.370
is there like a specific state of mind to have?

270
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.710
You'll know once you see your baby.

271
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.560
I had absolutely no idea.

272
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.510
Who knew I'd become such a fool for my daughter

273
00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:02.930
that I'd work so hard to pay for her academy lessons?

274
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:05.450
You just go with it!

275
00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.830
You just go with it.

276
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.950
- Should I go? 
 - You should eat!

277
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:12.940
Hurry and eat.

278
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.710
Okay, yeah!  Let's go.

279
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:19.400
Oh? There are pig feet in here.

280
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.000
Yeah. It's good, right?

281
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.620
I can't eat pig feet. But it's delicious.

282
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.350
It's good, right? Eat up a lot.

283
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.240
It's super chewy.

284
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:40.980
My mom sent me the herbal tonic so we can have a baby

285
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:44.230
only because she cares.

286
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.600
But he criticized her.

287
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.850
He should criticize his mom, why mine?

288
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:54.290
- Here. 
 - Childcare is 100 times harder than working.

289
00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.940
I've gained stamina while taking care of children, learned patience.

290
00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.800
Shouldn't that count as experience?

291
00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:11.170
I'm fine now.

292
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:16.330
But I thought the DINK couples had it easy. I guess they have their own hardships.

293
00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:20.970
You raise your children by yourself? I would rather work for a week straight,

294
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:23.610
I couldn't do that.

295
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.590
Me neither.

296
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.500
But... the kids are so beautiful that I keep doing it.

297
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.840
Even after they upset me and cause trouble,

298
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.250
when I see them sleeping, I wonder what I'd do without them.

299
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.540
<i>I told you to play with the kids, not scare them! Ah, seriously.</i>

300
00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:54.880
<i>Why? I was totally in character as a T-Rex! </i>

301
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.380
<i>It's Dad! Attack him!</i>

302
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.980
<i>Oh no!</i>

303
00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:04.620
<i>Let me see!</i>

304
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:07.970
You know...

305
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.080
Have you not thought about adoption?

306
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.070
Unmarried people can adopt.

307
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:18.980
Well, they look at your job and finances,

308
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.280
and they also look at various things like

309
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.910
whether you have family members that can help you take care of the child for qualification.

310
00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.710
You have to pass a home environment inspection, too.

311
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.490
She must have thought about it.

312
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.260
The child has to be a present, not an alternative.

313
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.540
I think I have to be very well-prepared so that neither the child or I will get hurt.

314
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:42.000
I don't have the confidence right now.

315
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.370
You think too much.

316
00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:52.450
What do you want to do? One in the living room and one in the bedroom, you want to do a ladder game of lotto?

317
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.870
I... want to go.

318
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.030
I miss my babies.

319
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.240
I knew you would.

320
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.500
Get back home safely after having fun.

321
00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.090
Let's meet up again.

322
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.030
As long as we don't meet under the same circumstances.

323
00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:16.300
Let me know when you get home.

324
00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.620
Sleep well, bye.

325
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:21.730
- Get home safe. 
 - See you again.

326
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.780
Okay, bye.

327
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.910
So you have thought about having a child.

328
00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:30.900
I have, of course.

329
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.760
But... not having a child sometimes

330
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.840
can feel like a vast empty castle,

331
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.490
but I'm more scared that it would bring disruption to our life.

332
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:49.380
My husband and I are very content with just us two.

333
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:57.710
What's that like with just the two of you?

334
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:00.180
We're devoted to each other.

335
00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.770
Since we only have each other, we're very interested in each other.

336
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.890
We're always curious about how each other's day has been,

337
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.770
<i>we check each other's feelings, and do everything together.</i>

338
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.750
<i>We respect each other's alone time.</i>

339
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:24.200
<i>And if one of us says, "Should we take a trip?" when we wake up in the morning,</i>

340
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.830
<i>then we can leave at any time.</i>

341
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.380
<i>We only have each other,</i>

342
00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:33.660
<i>so we're very affectionate to one another.</i>

343
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.120
Without a child,

344
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.680
you can live with just each other.

345
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:49.020
But to other people,

346
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:51.330
me, who doesn't want a child,

347
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.700
and you, who wants a child without marriage, are seen as abnormal.

348
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.970
We can't be understood.

349
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:01.490
We're not living to receive others' understanding.

350
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.510
We're merely making the choices we can.

351
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:07.640
You're doing well.

352
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.630
- Let's to to sleep. 
 - Sleep well.

353
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.280
Okay.

354
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.000
I'll take this one.

355
00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:50.590
This is an overnight rental cottage stay we're giving away as a gift.

356
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:54.350
Overnight rental cottage stay?

357
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:56.770
Wow.

358
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.770
Thank you.

359
00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.540
Yunho,

360
00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:10.860
what were you going to do if your husband didn't come to pick you up?

361
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.500
If I go home and complain that I'm hungry, he cooks for me.

362
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.770
The way we make up.

363
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.950
Senior, have fun with your boyfriend, too.

364
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.180
- Thank you. 
 - Get going.

365
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:30.090
Hurry.

366
00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.940
Let's go home.

367
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.850
Okay, okay!

368
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.600
I'm hungry!

369
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.990
<i>The place to return to...</i>

370
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.270
<i>Yunho and Eunyoung both...</i>

371
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.100
<i>would have left because they have places to return to.</i>

372
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.380
<i>When Mom received the stomach cancer surgery,</i>

373
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.150
<i>I was working.</i>

374
00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:03.890
<i>I had to work quickly in order to go to the hospital,</i>

375
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.920
<i>so I had no time to be upset or blame myself.</i>

376
00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:12.020
<i>Seeing Mom sick was foreign to me,</i>

377
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.590
<i>and it was the first time she seemed weak in my eyes.</i>

378
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.210
<i>Still, "It's nothing."</i>

379
00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.090
<i>"It's okay."</i>

380
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.530
<i>Mom and I...</i>

381
00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.640
<i>were like that.</i>

382
00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:33.330
<i>But then when I went home to an empty house,</i>

383
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.530
<i>I suddenly felt sad.</i>

384
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:39.860
<i>If I didn't have Mom,</i>

385
00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.320
<i>this empty house</i>

386
00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:48.530
<i>wouldn't be a place I could return to.</i>

387
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.440
<i>I...</i>

388
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.480
<i>have no place to return to.</i>

389
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.380
<i>No matter how far you travel,</i>

390
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.100
<i>no matter how tired life makes you feel,</i>

391
00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.190
<i>as long as you have a place to return to, you're okay.</i>

392
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.630
<i>Then you can deal with it.</i>

393
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.610
<i>That man...</i>

394
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.650
<i>will he be the place I can return to?</i>

395
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.130
Do you want to buy that?

396
00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.140
It's so cute, right?

397
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.370
You collected a lot in your house. Do you want to buy another one?

398
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:49.180
I don't have this one. I've never bought it.

399
00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.050
Weirdly, I want to buy that.

400
00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:57.910
Wow, if you're not drunk then it's scary.

401
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.870
Let me explain. It's like the

402
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.550
innocent child in me went out.

403
00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.440
I also want to be childish all of a sudden.

404
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.350
Is it that or me?

405
00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:16.450
That...

406
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:19.480
What do you mean?

407
00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.590
Why aren't you responding?

408
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.840
Are you thinking about it right now?

409
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.060
What thinking?

410
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.820
See, you're not responding.

411
00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.370
No, I mean how could I compare between that and you?

412
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.170
Are you saying you like that way more, so I can't be compared?

413
00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.630
No. I like that in a different way.

414
00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.540
Too late.

415
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:45.560
No, it's not like that.

416
00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.700
- Is this a safe car? 
 - Yes.

417
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:58.070
You can ride it once.

418
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:19.400
This way, please.

419
00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:27.240
- Oh, this... 
 - The Han River.

420
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.010
Wow, it's nice.

421
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.670
Let's live well, Yoon Jaeyoung.

422
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.310
Oh, I was completely nervous.

423
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:49.160
Was I too obvious? If you keep encouraging me, it won't be good.

424
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.460
Still, having small arguments makes it really feel like we're dating, so I like it.

425
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:57.480
We're busy enough being affectionate. Why waste time with arguments?

426
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.030
Um, should we go on a trip?

427
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.760
Since you worked so hard, you should relax.

428
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.750
An overnight trip?

429
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.950
Is that too short? Then two nights away?

430
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:15.370
Well... I want to keep spending time with you, too,

431
00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:19.340
but still, I have to go to work...

432
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.320
And sleeping two nights is a bit...

433
00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.200
What are you thinking?

434
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.720
No, no. Do whatever you want.

435
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:34.050
Coming over to my place and putting the toilet cleaner—

436
00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:37.490
The toilet cleaner...

437
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:40.590
that took a lot of courage from me.

438
00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:42.910
I did that because you seemed hesitant to get closer.

439
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:47.570
I didn't barge into your house because I had other motives.

440
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.090
It-It's not that. What I wanted to ask was—

441
00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:52.550
Never mind.

442
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:55.830
The toilet cleaner is working well, right?

443
00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.100
Don't follow me.

444
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.570
No...

445
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.610
I wanted to ask to go stay at a rental cottage together.

446
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.710
Why did you have to get so stuck?

447
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:25.070
Why would he talk about the toilet cleaner?

448
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.460
He's not following me.

449
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:32.990
Then go home!

450
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:35.920
Seriously.

451
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:47.780
I think I said something wrong.

452
00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.940
I made her into a strange woman.

453
00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.310
<i> [Hari, I...] </i>

454
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:05.700
No, no. There's no sincerity in this.

455
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:07.630
Texts are...

456
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.130
That's right.

457
00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:26.370
<i>[I love you.]</i>

458
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.790
Finally.

459
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:47.820
I'll copy this into a text and send it.

460
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.140
Do I have to call him first?

461
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.770
Well...

462
00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.190
I could. Why not?

463
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.590
<i> [Yisang] </i>

464
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.570
<i> [As Hari's boyfriend...] </i>

465
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.750
<i>As your boyfriend,</i>

466
00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:13.950
<i>about making you into a woman who is only interested in sex,</i>

467
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:17.330
<i>I sincerely apologize. About what happened today,</i>

468
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:21.530
<i>I will try my best to prevent it from ever happening again.</i>

469
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.720
<i>Again, I apologize.</i>

470
00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.480
<i>I love... you.</i>

471
00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.090
<i>I love you, too.</i>

472
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.070
Director!

473
00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.600
Don't forget. This moment that I saved you.

474
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.490
This time...

475
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.770
this memory.

476
00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:17.770
Are you...

477
00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:23.970
Sorry.

478
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.010
Director.

479
00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:48.880
At least once,

480
00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:55.650
I wanted to look like a man to you.

481
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:01.320
You looked cool to me.

482
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.330
I wanted to protect you because you seemed delicate,

483
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.110
and I wanted to be like you since you're such a strong person.

484
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:10.570
So...

485
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.630
I think I wanted to make a good impression.

486
00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:22.640
But now, to you,

487
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.990
I don't want to appear one way or the other.

488
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:28.240
I just want to see you

489
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.440
doing well, that's all.

490
00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:38.180
I'm doing well.

491
00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.240
And...

492
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.120
I've received so much comfort from you, too.

493
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.350
You're cool, Eutteum.

494
00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.500
Thank you.

495
00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.250
Yes, hello.

496
00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:12.630
I forgot her medicine. This is for her.

497
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:15.450
Okay. This...

498
00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.530
Doha spilled some juice.

499
00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:22.080
This isn't Doha's.

500
00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.390
Doha's mom brought it.

501
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.330
Doha's mom?

502
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.460
A few days ago, she came by with some toys and clothes

503
00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.240
and watched her from outside for a long time before she left.

504
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.750
<i> [Jiwon Vision School Children's Place] </i>

505
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.580
<i>Yes, Oppa.</i>

506
00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:48.200
See Doha.

507
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.210
Don't confuse her by seeing her whenever you have time however you want,

508
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:57.010
but see her at the same time on the same day. And don't get your hopes up uselessly.

509
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.840
Then this weekend is the only time available? Okay.

510
00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:15.070
Yes, then I'll book it.

511
00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.570
Okay. Thank you.

512
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:20.200
You scared me.

513
00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.390
This weekend with Hari,

514
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:25.840
you're going away? To where?

515
00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.800
Somewhere nice? Huh?

516
00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.290
I won't tell you!

517
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.300
Hey! Give it to me!

518
00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.930
Why do you want to see?

519
00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.970
Oh right! We have a workshop this weekend.

520
00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:40.990
<i>Huh? I have a free movie ticket. You can't go?</i>

521
00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:44.560
I don't think so. How can I skip the workshop at our company?

522
00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:47.470
Director Jang is so excited and making up the program for it.

523
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:51.850
I have to go and pretend to be excited.

524
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.320
You didn't even know her schedule before booking the place?

525
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.890
Seriously...

526
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.130
Go with your wife instead.

527
00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:09.640
I didn't ask for it, but thanks.

528
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.150
You're going to do well in life. Very well.

529
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.390
I'll enjoy it.

530
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:24.140
Wow. Look how luxurious it is.

531
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:28.190
The situation at the company is difficult, so they told us to not go.

532
00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.150
The workshop got canceled?

533
00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:33.810
But the decoration department went. Just us?

534
00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:37.110
Aren't we being ignored too much?

535
00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:41.410
Externally, they're talking about the company shutting down; and internally, the workshop gets canceled.

536
00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:45.430
Are we really going to shut down?

537
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:48.140
We have to make sure that doesn't happen.

538
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.720
Think of an event where we can show everyone how well we're doing.

539
00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.140
Yes.

540
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.320
Go ahead. Work.

541
00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.440
Yes.

542
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.100
Hello, Director.

543
00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.530
Welcome.

544
00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:14.000
You're well, right?

545
00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.090
What is it?

546
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:20.660
The ice-cream ad's contract fell through.

547
00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.430
The middle-aged photographer is too difficult and expensive.

548
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.690
The photos came out well, so it's fine.

549
00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:30.560
Instead,

550
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.250
you received an offer for a coffee ad.

551
00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:40.450
The shooting schedule is fixed. This weekend. Does it work?

552
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:43.110
This weekend...

553
00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:44.960
<i>We have a workshop this weekend.</i>

554
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:48.980
<i>Director Jang is so excited and making up the program for it.</i>

555
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.440
Okay. I should just work this weekend.

556
00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.070
This weekend, just the two of us alone.

557
00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:00.690
Is the school's parent meeting more important than me?

558
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:03.190
This isn't the first time!

559
00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.060
Chief!

560
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.030
Oh! Chief!

561
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.090
- You know— 
 - What?

562
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.770
Oh, Chief!

563
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.390
Hold on. I'll call you later.

564
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:16.670
Oh, no.

565
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:20.030
This is a limited edition Balenciaga!

566
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.460
What should I do?

567
00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.100
I-I-I'll give you money for the dry cleaning.

568
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:29.450
Oh no! It's an expensive dress.

569
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.780
Then, will this work?

570
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.410
Seriously.

571
00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:54.490
Eutteum! Eutteum!

572
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.010
Hello.

573
00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:57.890
We saw each other a little while ago.

574
00:44:57.890 --> 00:44:59.380
Yes.

575
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.030
Eutteum,

576
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:17.370
I was embarrassed, so I couldn't say it earlier, but thanks for looking after me at the precinct.

577
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:20.940
There were so many people around who were drunk,

578
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:27.310
and more than anything, I thought you might act indecently, so I couldn't leave.

579
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:35.860
Well... Anyway, thank you very much.

580
00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.370
So this...

581
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.110
What is it?

582
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:44.930
It's a rental cottage gift card.

583
00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:48.420
- If you don't have anybody to go with later, I— 
 - Oh!

584
00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.810
Thank you. I think my parents will like it.

585
00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:52.550
Thank you.

586
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:57.950
Why would he talk about parents all of a sudden?

587
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:01.560
I uselessly gave it to him. What a waste.

588
00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.820
- Mr. Eutteum? 
 - Yes?

589
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.820
We need to get this confirmed.

590
00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.890
Okay, I understand.

591
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.900
I'm really sorry.

592
00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:18.960
I... am a bad husband for forgetting our wedding anniversary.

593
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:25.050
Even if we couldn't go overseas, we should have gone and ate at a nice restaurant.

594
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:31.290
To you who's been working yourself to the bone, there's nothing I've done.

595
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:36.100
Honey, I'm really sorry.

596
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.110
Next year, I will—

597
00:46:37.110 --> 00:46:39.340
Manager Kim.

598
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.820
Hold on.

599
00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:44.750
Yeah. What's up?

600
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.830
What?

601
00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.380
Go here.

602
00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.380
What is this?

603
00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:57.160
It's a rental cottage gift card.

604
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:04.780
When did he get this?

605
00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:10.190
Pension Nohseonjae? Where is this place?

606
00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.520
- Manager! 
 - Yeah?

607
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:17.230
My sales report is messed up completely again!

608
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.760
What's the matter with the Advertising Department?

609
00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.290
Really? Again?

610
00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:24.070
This is not the first time! It's so exhausting!

611
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:28.620
Okay. I'll check it again. You didn't tell the Director, right?

612
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:30.980
I'm going to right now.

613
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.350
What's wrong with you?

614
00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:39.330
This... go with your husband.

615
00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:43.230
It's a rental cottage. A really nice place.

616
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.870
You shouldn't keep giving me things like these.

617
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:47.870
Come on, don't get upset.

618
00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:51.010
Don't tell Chief Editor Jang.

619
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.020
Just this once.

620
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.990
Thank you.

621
00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.420
Payment for letting me stay over.

622
00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:23.520
Go with Chief Han.

623
00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:25.750
This weekend?

624
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.850
<i> [We invite you to our 'Nohseonjae Cottage.']</i> 
 <i> [Room Type: Standard] </i>

625
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.540
What's this?

626
00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:44.500
I got a car.

627
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.210
Get in.

628
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.520
Why'd you get a car suddenly?

629
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.190
Doha's big now. There will be a lot of times where I'll have to drive her around.

630
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:13.550
If you end work late at dawn, do you want me to pick you up?

631
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.600
You don't need to worry about me, too.

632
00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.600
I'm looking into a house near the hospital.

633
00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.790
You're leaving?

634
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.060
I need to find my place.

635
00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:29.320
The hospital is coming along, and I can look after Doha alone now.

636
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.740
And I even make the baby food myself.

637
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:40.790
You only think of me as the grade-schooler with a runny nose who used to get beat up by you,

638
00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:44.830
but I'm a pretty okay guy.

639
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:49.560
After living like a yahoo selling off your house and car...

640
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.050
It's like watching an Australopithecus evolve into a human being.

641
00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:56.130
I feel very proud.

642
00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:59.840
I need to live like a human being.

643
00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.030
While making the people I love happy.

644
00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:13.090
I'm going to go look at houses on the weekend. Want to come?

645
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:15.400
Will you take a look with me?

646
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:30.500
You want to go here?

647
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:34.500
It's called Nohseonjae. It's supposed to be a nice rental cottage.

648
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:37.600
I wanted to go but you should go.

649
00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.830
This weekend, you should take Doha and Jungwon—

650
00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:42.780
Jang Hari.

651
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:47.870
But I'm talking to you right now.

652
00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.630
That we should look at houses together.

653
00:50:55.950 --> 00:51:02.110
This weekend, Aunt is taking care of Doha. We should eat together and look at houses.

654
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.850
And you should listen to what I have to say.

655
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:11.450
I want to tell you how I'm going to live from now on.

656
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.100
There's nothing I can't listen to as your friend.

657
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:25.420
But... let's talk later.

658
00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:29.660
Let's talk that day.

659
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:40.510
<i>Did you finish work? I'll be waiting at the park.</i>

660
00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:48.190
Drop me off in front over there. I have an appointment.

661
00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.320
Okay.

662
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:03.190
Go inside.

663
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:24.130
I might forget your face. I haven't seen you in such a long time.

664
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:28.980
We're so busy. What are you doing on the weekend?

665
00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.420
I have a photoshoot booked this weekend.

666
00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:37.940
You work on the weekends? I wanted us to go on a trip.

667
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:41.910
You said you were going to the workshop on the weekend.

668
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.190
- It got canceled. 
 - It did?

669
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:49.420
Why? It can't be canceled?

670
00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:54.190
No, no. What's done is done.

671
00:52:55.460 --> 00:53:01.170
I have a gift card for a weekend stay at a rental cottage. I guess you can't go.

672
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:03.830
A rental cottage gift card? Where?

673
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.270
We can't even go, so why would I...

674
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:11.780
tell you that it's called Nohseonjae Rental Cottage in Gyeonggi-do, Japyeong, on Bongseon-ro 17?

675
00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.750
- Do you have the gift card with you? 
 - Yes.

676
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:17.680
Let me see.

677
00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:23.310
Here.

679
00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:30.800
What's wrong?

680
00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.800
I think... we have to go here no matter what.

681
00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.410
Even if I finish my photoshoot late, I'll definitely come.

682
00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:39.780
You don't have to go out of your way to.

683
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:43.850
I feel like I'll end up there even if I can't go.

684
00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:45.000
Wait for me.

685
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.700
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:19.650
- It's been a long time. 
 - Ah, yes.

694

You came all the way here.

Big Bro!

I wrapped up a little for you to have a taste.

697
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:32.980
You could have wrapped up a lot, but you only packed a little?

698
00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:37.230
It might seem like little once you start eating it, but... should I bring you more?

699
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:39.120
It's okay.

700
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.190
I'll eat it well.

701
00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.530
Is Hari still working there?

702
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:51.590
What? Hari?

703
00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:55.750
Well, what would Hari be doing and where?

704
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:04.140
Did he leave?

705
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.860
What is he up to that he shows up to borrow money when I start forgetting about him?

706
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:13.750
But... why did he ask about Hari's company?

707
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:15.130
You should have said you didn't know!

708
00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:19.030
Well I just... pretended to not know.

709
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:21.530
But he's so quick-witted.

710
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:24.140
Maybe because he's been gambling for so long.

711
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.530
So... did you tell him?

712
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:31.720
Well, I-I just said that she should still be working at the same place she did...

713
00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:35.350
How could you tell him that? What if Sis finds out!

714
00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:39.920
What if she gets angry and tells us to give up the store?

715
00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.710
Should I have said she moved abroad?

716
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:45.250
So frustrating!

717
00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:50.470
Hello. I came to buy some bread.

718
00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:58.520
I won't take it for free!

719
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:00.810
Just pay your rent on time.

720
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:10.950
These days, I have a lot of concerns.

721
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:14.070
W-W-Why? Did something happen?

722
00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:18.470
Hari has two men.

723
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:21.050
One is a doctor and the other is a photographer.

724
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:25.320
They're not lacking in jobs or looks.

725
00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:29.300
Who should I pick?

726
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:34.870
Making a brag into a concern. I don't know if I should say I'm jealous

727
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:37.830
or choose one with you.

728
00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:41.290
We can choose with you! That turned out well.

729
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:45.630
Excuse me. Tell me Hari's phone number.

730
00:57:01.220 --> 00:57:02.510
Have a good weekend.

731
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:03.860
Yes, goodbye!

732
00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.620
Goodbye!

733
00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.790
<i>Jaeyoung, I'm not going.</i>

734
00:57:45.790 --> 00:57:47.810
<i> Don't wait for me.</i>

735
00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.690
How could you take up two schedules?

736
00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.110
For now, come quickly.

737
00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:07.080
Is the model not coming?

738
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:13.280
She just got done with her schedule out of town.

739
00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.640
If you just wait a little bit more, she'll be here soon.

740
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:21.470
But I've been waiting for three hours now.

741
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:25.700
Isn't it right for us to just push the shoot back?

742
00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.580
Please save me this once.

743
00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:32.160
It's too hard to reschedule, and the advertiser said it has to be done according to their ad system

744
00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:35.580
and told me to shoot it by today and submit it. Really...

745
00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:37.850
Can you please look over this once?

746
00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:41.550
<i>Please save me. I have a kid at home.</i>

747
00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:02.440
Are you done? I arrived.

748
00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:07.360
I think the photoshoot will end late at night. Maybe even at dawn.

749
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:11.100
I feel sorry you'll be alone.

750
00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.490
I'll bravely stay here alone.

751
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:18.010
If you can't come, it doesn't sound bad for me to rest here on my own.

752
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:22.840
I'll go right when my work ends. I'm sorry.

753
00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.530
Then I'll be waiting.
