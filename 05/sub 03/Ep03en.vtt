00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:33.760
do you?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.430
-Sorry?
-You know,

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.400
I get worried
around this time of the year.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.540
Don't you trust me,
the ultimate human detector?

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.210
There's nothing fishy about Eun-byul.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.950
Really? I'll take your word on this.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:55.150
-All right.
-Welcome!

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.550
-Wait for me here.
-What should I get?

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.590
I'm going to die early
because of Eun-byul.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:03.660
How much is this?

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.230
How much?

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.240
-That'll be a dollar.
-A dollar?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.040
Jae-hyuk.
I don't need to buy anything. Let's go.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.440
Seems like we've got nothing to buy.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.310
Bye.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.850
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:27.320
-I got this.
-Nice job.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.680
Well done.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.160
Hey, watch the store for me.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.960
Just let them be. Don't cause a scene.

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.330
My boss will cause one if I let them be.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.330
Hey! Saet-byul!

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.710
[Part-timer Wanted]

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.840
You can't just leave me here!

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.280
Sure she can.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.520
My goodness! How can you even look

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:07.790
so perfect in a uniform? Check that out.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.130
I look so adorable.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.300
-Let me go!
-Get over here!

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.850
Welcome.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:34.050
Thank you very much for visiting
our store.

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.450
Why are you here? Where's Dae-hyun?

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:39.590
You better know how lucky you were
that day.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.590
As you should, too.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.230
They say that you meet your enemy
at the worst time and place.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.530
Seems like this must be it.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.330
No, this is just a convenience store.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.030
Don't you know metaphors, you idiot?

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.430
You're even more of an idiot.
And did you go gambling or something?

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.730
Your entire outfit is a jackpot.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.570
-You're covered in roses.
-I'm going to smack you.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm going to smack you!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:00.470
-Gosh.
-Go ahead. Hit me.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.940
-Seriously!
-Hit me.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.680
-You're so ugly.
-Get out of my way.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.650
I was just about to.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.650
What's wrong with you?

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.420
-Hello!
-Hello...

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.390
-Hey!
-Why is she so scary?

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.290
Hold up, you prick!
Next time you see me, I'll kill you!

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.260
You're so ugly.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.260
How annoying.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.600
That startled me!

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.140
Darn it. Who are you?

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:37.950
Thank you for being at the perfect place
for me to beat you all up.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.810
-Are you crazy?
-How did you get here?

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.250
You guys were just stealing
left and right.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:44.850
We're always like this.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.490
The old man lets us off the hook,
so why are you acting up?

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.090
Because I can't watch such a thing.

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.260
Close your eyes next time, then.

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.100
We're gentlemen, so we don't hit girls.

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.370
-Of course.
-Just leave.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.330
Just leave already!

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.970
Really? I love beating men up.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.470
You can just get beaten up, then.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.310
What is she talking about?

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.740
Oh, my.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.050
Kid, you won't be able to work
if you get hospitalized.

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.210
I won't be able to visit you all
at the hospital because I have work.

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.520
-Get rid of her.
-Gosh.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.950
Take care of it, you guys.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.090
-How absurd.
-You're really asking for it.

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.520
Hold on. Does anyone know
what Wolf's bane symbolizes?

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.490
I'll let you off the hook if you do.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.430
Let me give you a hint. It's your future.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.460
What, stealing more
from the convenience store?

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.730
Hearing you be obedient to us?

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.500
Taking your paycheck?

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.570
Come here. Let me just beat you up.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.770
How dare a tiny thing like you

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.410
approach us like this?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.510
I'm bleeding! You!

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.020
-I'm borrowing this.
-Give it back!

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.720
You're nothing but a part-timer.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.090
How dare you?

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.300
You're dead today.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.610
How can these idiots get beaten up
by a girl?

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.010
I'm a little different, kid.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.450
How dare you?

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.290
My hand!

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.030
Hey!

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:33.730
Darn it.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.600
[Wolf's bane symbolizes
misanthropy and death.]

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.440
Stealing someone else's property is bad.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.980
It's a crime.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.710
Bring the list of everything you've stolen
with the money to pay for them.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.180
I'll be able to become
an official part-timer, then!

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.320
Seriously?

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:05.790
And don't throw your change at me
when you're buying from the store.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.930
Would you like it
if I threw things at you?

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.330
That's called manners.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:14.300
Understood?

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:15.800
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.210
Dae-hyun, pick up the phone.
It's an emergency.

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.480
Aren't you Mr. Choi's friend?

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:35.360
-What a surprise to see you here.
-Hello.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.490
Are you calling Mr. Choi?

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:44.700
No, I'm just calling my parents
in Onyang, South Chungcheong Province,

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.370
just to check up on how they're doing.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.240
What a great son you are.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:55.010
Did you happen to see anything back there?

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.340
No, I didn't see anything.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.280
I severely lack in Vitamin A,
so I have a terrible night vision.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.589
I'm practically blind at night,

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.520
so I can only tell people by smell.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.720
I see.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.260
Be careful on your way home, then.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.960
Okay.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:16.859
-It was nice seeing you.
-You too.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.240
Bye!

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:26.440
What a scoundrel she is.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:30.080
Since when did Shinseong-dong become
so sketchy?

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.960
Gosh, what are you doing here, Yeon-joo?

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.730
This isn't like you.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.000
Who on earth turned you into this stalker?

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.570
He hired an eye candy for his part-timer.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.180
Ms. Yoo, you really haven't seen her yet?

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.110
No.

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.850
I'm here to check out the store
as an employee

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.450
of the headquarters.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.190
If I have to describe myself,
I'd be like a secret royal inspector.

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.220
[Here comes]

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.360
[the secret royal inspector!]

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.900
[Jung Saet-byul]

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.070
Excuse me. Can you ring these up?

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.840
-It's 20 dollars.
-Okay. Here you go.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.980
Goodness, girl.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:16.720
I can tell that you have
very high standards. I got you.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.520
But I'm really sorry to break it to you.
I'm not into that.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.920
Pardon?

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.820
You know? I like men.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.890
Sure thing. I didn't say anything.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.330
But why are you asking me for my number?
You gave me your phone. That's adorable.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.430
I want you to run the transaction
with my phone.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:33.770
What's that?

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.570
You really don't know?
This replaces a physical card.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.170
I see. Oh, that? I've heard of that.
I know what it is,

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.140
but I only use cash.

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.840
Please run it quickly.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.510
Wait, so what am I supposed
to do with this?

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:48.880
What do I do?

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.650
Girl, if you had cash, you should've paid
with that from the get-go.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:05.930
Seriously. I know that
men dig anyone young and interesting.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:09.140
But she doesn't look young or interesting.
How am I supposed to understand this?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:10.800
Gosh, I came here to get mad,

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.010
but it makes me angrier
that there's nothing to be mad about.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.340
It's only ruining my style.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.010
-Come on.
-I was just kidding.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.350
-Seriously.
-That's too much.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.880
But I'm really happy to be drinking
with former colleagues today.

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:23.520
It's been a while.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:26.290
-I agree.
-Hey, you guys.

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.120
I'm going to use the restroom.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.690
-You don't have to tell us that.
-She's cute.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:35.700
Dae-hyun, you'd better keep this in mind.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.500
I know this because
I'm dating a colleague in secret.

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.170
Director Cho likes Ms. Yoo.

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.070
Well, he can't make his move on her
because she's involved with you.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.410
But he's the son of the chairman.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.980
If he wants something, I'm sure
nothing will stop him from pursuing it.

00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.510
Hey, stop it. Stop talking nonsense.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.720
If you have time to talk nonsense,
you should have one more drink.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.390
You insolent girl! Where have you been?

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:09.460
Your Highness,
I had to deal with those thugs.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:12.730
What? Tell me how you handled them.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.400
I completely destroyed them.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.810
Let me award you a big present.

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.110
Hurry and give me a high-five.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:22.180
Gosh.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.380
Your Highness,
why don't you take that off now?

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.180
If you want me to take it off, I will.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.000
I won't.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.870
-What about Dad?
-He's alive.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.510
Yong-pil.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.250
-I'm fine. It's just my hand.
-Okay.

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:06.530
That's enough.

00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:13.370
Mom, you were really patient.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.740
Eat some kimchi.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.920
-Eun-byul, yesterday, I was summoned
-Yes.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.350
to the convenience store.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.460
Why? For what?

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.790
Because of you.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.160
Did you know your sister found out
you've been running with the wrong crowd?

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:42.600
As long as you don't say anything,
she'll never find out.

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.130
Hey, when did I say
I'd turn a blind eye to that?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.630
I gave you time to clean it up.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.700
You'd better clean that up quickly.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:50.800
If she catches you, I'll be dead meat too.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.410
I really want to graduate this year.

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.870
Okay. Fine.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.840
-By the way,
-What?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.350
when my sister dropped out of school,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.250
why did you stop coming to school?

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.680
Back then,

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.020
-I was loyal.
-That's not true.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.790
According to my sister,
you used my sister as an excuse.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.490
You didn't want to go to school.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.560
You're just like your sister.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.160
Just eat that.

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.070
It's good.

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:23.400
Mr. Choi.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.570
Hey, Saet-byul. You're here.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:28.040
Did you ask me to come early
because you missed me?

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.810
No, that's not it.
I'm going to a reunion today.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.280
But the way you dressed up
is totally to my liking.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.350
This is how I always dress,
Ms. Temporary Part-timer.

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.790
-Don't I look cool?
-I doubt it.

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.960
Are you wearing cologne?

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.920
-Hey, stop that.
-Are you not?

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.490
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:49.030
-Isn't your zodiac sign Libra?
-Yes.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:51.160
You'll get very lucky
in the romance department.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.300
Really? I'll get lucky? How?

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.070
All of your efforts will come to nothing.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.470
Sure. That sounds so great. Thank you.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:03.410
You shouldn't see your girlfriend today.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.740
I can't see her anyway.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.180
-Really?
-Yes.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.210
Hey, you're living in a high-tech era.

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:11.050
How can you believe in such horoscopes?
It's very out-dated.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.320
Don't you agree, young lady?

Gosh, why are you so mean to me?

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.970
Right. Mr. Choi, can you fill in
for me tomorrow? I have plans.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:29.500
Sure. Have a good day. I'm leaving now.

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.240
-Dae-hyun, I need to talk to you
-Okay.

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:33.340
about your part-timer.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.810
Hey, I was actually going
to ask you to help me.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.910
Can you fill in for her tomorrow night?

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.710
There are a lot of expired meal boxes.
Eat them.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.120
-I'm late. Bye.
-Hey, that's not important.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.720
There's something you must know
about your part-timer!

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:47.390
You must know the evil side of her.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.630
Hello.

Hi.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.670
Why are you here at this hour, Saet-byul?

00:34:00.730 --> 00:34:03.140
It sounded like
you needed to talk to Mr. Choi.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.110
No.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.840
You said there was something about me
he had to know. What is that about?

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:13.449
I'm the part-timer you mentioned.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.949
-My hand!
-Hey.

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:19.750

I'd like to toast for the success of
our fellow classmates

from Taesung University and for the health
of Professor Kim Sin-woo.

-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.219
We should have eaten
at a restaurant near our school.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.460
Why did you pick such a fancy place?

00:34:58.520 --> 00:34:59.890
We're not students anymore.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.760
And one of us made a fortune
through investments.

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.630
-Really? Who is that?
-Who is that?

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:05.770
Tell me about that investment.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.500
Sir, I don't think it will work for you.
It's the Girlfriend Investment.

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.310
-Girlfriend?
-Girlfriend Investment?

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.710
Hey, that's not a nice way
to describe my relationship.

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:17.580
-Come on.
-She's a team leader who studied abroad.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.950
She's a beautiful older lady.
And she comes from a rich family.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.250
-My goodness. Really?
-Is that true?

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.890
Sir, no. He's just kidding.
Don't believe what he tells you.

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:29.160
Hurry up and marry her
before she changes her mind.

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.620
-Shouldn't you?
-The next time we meet,

-Good for you.

Happy birthday, sir.

You know what?
Let's go home and have wine together.

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:39.060
We have a really nice bottle of wine.

Yes, it's been sitting around for ages.
I guess you'll finally get to drink it.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.600
Let's get going now.

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.200

-Yes, I'm very happy.

-Really?
-You've been together for over two years,

but you still haven't met them?

Dae-hyun, get your act straight.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:33.810
I heard rich people date just for fun
and marry people from similar backgrounds.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.350
-I heard that too.
-It's pretty common.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.950
-My gosh, you startled me.
-What was that for?

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.420
-Hey. You guys.
-Gosh, you punk.

-Okay, fine.
-Let's drink.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:56.400
-Let's get wasted!
-Let's drink!

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.640

Gosh, look how much you've grown.

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.290
You were pretty even when you were young.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.820
Life is short. Enjoy it while you can.

00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.260
Seung-joon, are you making Yeon-joo
work at your company

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.160
so that she won't get a chance
to date anyone else?

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.630
Oh, yes.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.630
Your dad is waiting. Let's go.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.730
Okay.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.500
Let's go.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:44.920
Saet-byul, are you...

00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.690
What are you doing here?

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.730
Why are you sitting here?

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:56.330
You asked me for a new menu.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.970
So this time,
I plan to try something with noodles.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:03.800
You know my Oh Gamja Cheese French Fries
are really popular, right?

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:05.870
If you plan to do something with noodles,
make it spicy.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.510
They say Koreans get their energy
from two things.

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:11.740
We get energy from rice and spicy foods.

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:15.850
But why do you look so down?

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.580
It looks like someone got you good.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:24.760
Make sure you add enough toppings

00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:26.390
so that it'll be filling.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:30.000
Toppings? How about chicken breasts
or sausages?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:31.960
Sausages are too artificial.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.130
And chicken breasts are too dry.

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:36.340
Then what should I add?

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.070
Why are you asking me?
It's your job to come up with it.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:43.210
You're the one who asked me
to come up with a new menu.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.640
Normally, other people

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:48.010
would just think of it as a conversation.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.020
I might as well
just throw my shoes at him.

00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:05.130
Saet-byul, I heard that.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.700
-Really?
-Yes.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:10.500
Please ring these up.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:13.370
Okay. Do you want a plastic bag?
It costs two cents.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440
Yes.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:22.950
Hey, Saet-byul. About...

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.450
About that thing...

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.920
What was the name of that app
that tells you your daily horoscope?

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:31.160
Daily Guru?

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.260
Yes, Daily Guru.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:37.500
Can you download it for me?

00:40:39.830 --> 00:40:43.900
I guess I was right.
You really did have a disappointing day.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.310
I'll download it for you.

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:50.840
By the way,
why can't you come to work tomorrow?

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.510
I'm busy with something.

Anyway, what matters
is that it's not a big deal.

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:34.750
I did nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.450

I have so much faith in you,
so you didn't need to tell me.

that you opened up to me about it.

Sure, that's fine with me.
You can order whatever.

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.020
"Whatever"? Okay.

and some dried pollack.

We opened today.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:02.860
I was just kidding.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.000
Normally,
I'd ask for the bottle I left behind,

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.900
but this looks like a cheap bar,
so that won't sound right.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.270
Honey, what do you want to eat?
I'll get you anything you want.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:15.610
Geum-bi, stop it.

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.410
What? I'm just trying to have fun.

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.240
Honey, isn't this fun?

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.180
You're the only one having fun.
The worker doesn't find it amusing at all.

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.850
I bet he wants to punch you in the face,

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.790
take your eyeballs out,
and just chew on them.

00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:34.630
Isn't that right?

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:39.230
We'll order Set A
and an extra glass of beer.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.830
Okay, Set A.

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:44.240
-See you later, honey.
-Hey.

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.170
-What?
-Your face scared him off.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.440
-This is called love.
-Are you going to come here tomorrow?

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:49.710
I'm going to come here tomorrow.

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.150
Yeon-joo, I'll be withdrawing
my installment savings soon.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.280
And I still have
the housing subscription account I made

00:50:55.350 --> 00:50:56.980
when I first got hired at our company.

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.820
Why are you telling me that?

00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:02.790
You know, they say guys become mature
once they get married.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.320
I disagree with that.

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.190
They should be mature to begin with.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.260
It's useless to force oneself
to grow up after marriage.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:10.330
Yes, you do have a point.

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.700
-But considering our age--
-Hello.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.830
We're here to promote a product.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.040
-Yeon-joo, this is--
-What's this?

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:20.810
It's a product made by
a convenience store brand.

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.910
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:28.550
[A totally different...]

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:31.480
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes...

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.750
It maximizes your energy
and gets rid of your hangover.

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.360
Okay, great.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.960
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.430
Yeon-joo, isn't this the product
you worked on?

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.960
Are they promoting the product
or boycotting it?

00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:47.370
Don't be like that.
She just got it all mixed up.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:49.000
-"It gets rid of--"
-Dae-hyun.

00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:51.640
Hello!

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.770
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.810
It contains herbal medicine,
so it's great for your body!

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.280
-It's great!
-Let's go.

00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:04.320
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.650
You need to give us one more.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.650
-Oh, there are two of you.
-There are two people.

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.190
What are you talking about?
There are three...

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.620
Where did she go?

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.790
Just give us one more.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:19.300
-Okay, great!
-Great!

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.170
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.010
What just happened?

00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:31.110
-Is he your ex-boyfriend?
-Are you nuts?

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.510
I used to do that before I got a job
at the convenience store.

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:36.720
-Then why did you hide?
-You idiot.

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.320
-Is your brain an ornament?
-Yes, I think so.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.520
He's only working with that fool
because Saet-byul is

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:43.520
no longer available.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:47.190
You really know
how it feels not to have much.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.700
-Did you visit your dad?
-Yes.

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:57.440
-Did Eun-byul go too?
-Yes.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.200
How is she doing? Is she doing okay?

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:01.010
Why wouldn't she be doing okay?

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.010
She's being raised by a great sister.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.240
I miss Eun-byul.

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:08.510
You can come see her at my house.
She's probably sleeping right now.

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.190
♫ That's what life is all about ♫

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.490
♫ Everyone is born empty-handed ♫

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.060
♫ Life is all about the present moment ♫

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.260
♫ Amor fati ♫

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:33.340
♫ Amor fati ♫

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.970
♫ Amor fati ♫

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:41.850
[It was perfect!]

00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:44.320
[Nice one!]

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:50.320
Hey, I got a perfect score.

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:52.860
Will you forgive my friends now?

00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:57.330
Consider yourselves lucky
for having such a good friend.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.770
Eun-byul, you're an amazing singer.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.530
You should become an idol star.

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.840
She's going to audition.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:12.110
Really? You guys,
why don't we take a group photo

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.010
to wish her good luck on her audition?

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.720
-Gather together. Come here.
-Okay.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.480
Get on your knees.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:21.450
Hey, get out of there. Come here.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.620
Eun-byul, you're a star. Get up.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.660
You're going to be an idol star,
so strike a pose and put your foot there.

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:27.930
Place it on her leg.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.860
Make it look natural. Smile for me.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.230
-Let's keep it natural.
-Good job.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300
Smile.

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.170
If we upload this on social media
after you become famous,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.910
it'll cause a pretty big issue.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.810
"Jung Eun-byul,
an idol star who used to be a bully."

00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:50.380
Yes, exactly. There are tons of idol stars
who totally messed up their careers

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.150
for being a bully in the past
regardless of how hard they worked.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:57.590
If anyone gets in the way of her success,
I'll teach that person a lesson.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.330
Eun-byul, don't worry about a thing.
Just work hard

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.800
and make a lot of money.

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.500
Okay, thank you.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:09.570
Let's split your income by half.

00:55:10.070 --> 00:55:13.770
My dream is to make tons of money
by becoming a talent agent.

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:20.880
What are you laughing about?

00:55:21.450 --> 00:55:24.120
Hey, you'd better work hard.

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:25.180
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:27.190
I heard Joon opened up a bar nearby.

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:30.390
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.430
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:38.260
Come on. Please?

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:39.630
I need to see your IDs.

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:42.030
Gosh, I can't believe this.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:44.870
I swear we're not underage.

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.370
Then show me your ID.

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.610
This is totally killing the mood.

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.310
Gosh, I'm serious.
Didn't you bring your ID?

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:54.880
-No, I didn't.
-We just didn't bring our IDs.

00:55:55.210 --> 00:55:58.050
What is this? Who asked for this song?

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.880
It's my dad's song.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.020
I was going to request it first.
You beat me to it.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.730
What kind of a song is this?
It doesn't suit the place at all.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.000
Why? I like it.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:15.330
This song is really touching.
It makes you tear up.

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.900
Then I'll leave you to cry.
I need to go to the bathroom.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.310
Okay.

00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:25.980
-Gosh, this is so annoying.
-My gosh.

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.280
Excuse me.

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.950
Can't you see that we're talking?
Do you have no manners?

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.920
Either crawl under my arm
or just use another path.

00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:35.820
She's so annoying.

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.830
I'll come back next time for a drink.

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:44.830
Let me use the bathroom though.

00:56:47.770 --> 00:56:49.200
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.720
Go smoke outside.

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.520
What's wrong with this?

00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:11.590
I want to smoke, but I can't.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.660
I can't light up a cigarette
because my shoulder hurts.

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:21.170
Do you know why? Because you hit
my shoulder and broke my collarbone.

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:22.630
What?

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.440
Are you talking to me
like I'm your friend?

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:30.040
You'll have to pay for my treatment,
compensation,

00:57:30.110 --> 00:57:31.480
and the alcohol I didn't get to drink.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.920
You at least owe me 1,000 dollars.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:40.090
My gosh!

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:42.420
What do you think you're doing?

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:44.020
Do you have a death wish?

00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:46.120
Why are you doing this?

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.790
I heard your boss has a girlfriend.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:51.630
You should teach him a lesson
for cheating on you.

00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:55.000
No, technically speaking,
he didn't cheat on her.

00:57:55.070 --> 00:57:57.900
She may have liked him first,
but she never got to make him hers.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.240
That's such a cheap expression,

00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.310
but it's very easy to understand.

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:04.140
Hey, forget it.

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.680
Daily Guru told me
I'll get a boyfriend this year,

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:08.080
so mind your own business.

00:58:08.850 --> 00:58:13.020
And he'd be crazy
to not fall for a beauty like me.

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:19.060
Sometimes, I'm worried
that she actually thinks she's pretty.

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.830
-Then am I not pretty?
-No, you're not.

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:25.300
You only come in second
among all three of us.

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:27.600
Then who's the ugliest?

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:30.540
Gosh, come on.
Don't make me say it out loud.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.970
Why? Because it's you?

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.470
Don't you have a mirror at home?

00:58:34.610 --> 00:58:37.880
You guys can choose who's the ugliest
until I come back from the bathroom.

00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.750
Personally, I think both of you
come in last.

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.810
Get lost. Just go and poop.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:49.420
-Use another bathroom.
-What?

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.520
Can you move? I really need to go.

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:55.230
Then just do it here.

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.000
What are you glaring at?

00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:02.430
Do you want to get beaten up
or just leave quietly?

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:04.900
-You'll really regret it.
-My gosh.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:11.510
Come on. Let's make it quick.
I'm really tired right now.

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:14.910
You hurt me, so you need to pay for that.

00:59:14.980 --> 00:59:18.480
-You must be out of your mind.
-Unbelievable.

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:23.390
I don't want your phone.
I want your money. Give me money.

00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.030
No one is around to help you,
so hurry up and give me money.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:42.540
Hey, I don't care what you're doing,
but take it outside.

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:44.440
You can't just hog the bathroom like this.

00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:47.150
Where do you think you're going?

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.220
Did... Did you do that to my friends?

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.680
Why? Do you need a beating as well?

00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:55.290
Go ahead and try if you can.

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:58.720
Where are you going? Just stay inside.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.190
Stay right there. Everything will be fine.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:04.960
You'll get hurt, so stay inside.

01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:18.140
Hey, Yeon-joo.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.180
What? Where?

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.520
[They normally
don't get beaten up like that.]

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:27.820
I guess you're here with a big group.

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:30.760
Can't you see that I'm here by myself?
You must be pretty intimidated.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.060
No, I'm not.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.830
Oh, hello.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.030
You little... What just happened?

01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:43.170
Where is it?

01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:46.200
What the...

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:49.640
-Will you please come out?
-Why are you doing this to me?

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:53.240
Why do you think?
I really need to go to the bathroom.

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:55.780
-Stop it.
-Yeon-joo!

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:57.920
-Gosh, please get out.
-Stop it.

01:00:57.980 --> 01:01:01.120
-Yeon-joo, are you okay? What happened?
-I don't know.

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:04.260
-Gosh, what was that?
-What happened?

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.030
Mr. Choi?

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:10.600
Saet-byul.

01:01:11.230 --> 01:01:12.300
Who?

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.300
What the... What happened?
She's our part-timer.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:18.870
The girl you told me to be nice to.

01:01:20.070 --> 01:01:21.410
She's the part-timer?

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.210
"Yeon-joo"?
