(Previously on Episode 25)
You still like her, right?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.420
You have broken up with Zhou Xiao.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.180
There's a mail Yichun sent you a year ago.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.260
Why haven't you opened it?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.860
Isn't this your genetic testing report?

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.660
Zhou Xiao.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.420
It's been a long time.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:09.460
(Episode 26: Sweet Voice Print)

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.460
Take care.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.540
Ling,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.180
is your foot fine?

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.820
Is it seriously injured?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.780
I went to the library to look for you.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.940
Lu said you got injured.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.420
Are you injured anywhere else?

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.540
Why are you here?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.700
Have you come to see whether I am dead?.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.660
How could you joke at such a time?

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.140
I am off now.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.220
I will leave Tao Ling to you.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.860
Goodbye!

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.300
Luo Wei, come back!

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.460
We have broken up, right?

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.620
Why are you here?

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.700
Your foot got injured.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.900
I am worried about you.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.780
Worried?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.340
You are so busy.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.620
How come you have got the time
to care about me?

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.940
Tao Ling,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.540
could you stop talking in such a manner?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.020
I really like you a lot.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.860
Like me?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.700
Is it of any use?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.820
I don't want your sweet words.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860
I want you to accompany me.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.260
Since we quarreled last time,
where have you been?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.940
Have you come to see me once?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.140
Have you ever worried about me?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.940
So this is how you like me.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.700
Right.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.540
Everything you said is right.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.900
However,

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.980
at the present stage,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.900
I really don't have too much time
to accompany you.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.300
Actually, over these days,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.700
I have been thinking a lot.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.380
What have you thought about?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.700
Over these years we spent together,

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.260
in your view,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.860
I have been forcing you
to do things you don't like.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.740
I have been tolerating your laziness.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.820
You have been tired of coordinating with me.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.140
I have also been tired of accommodating you.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.140
We are like

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.660
two worlds that can never cross paths.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.940
We can't be integrated at all.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.740
What do you want to say exactly?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:13.620
Perhaps we're really not

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.540
suitable for each other.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.940
Let's break up.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.620
Are you serious about this?

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.660
I am sorry!

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.460
Let me escort you back to the dorm.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.380
You need not.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.820
I can manage it myself.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.020
Your boyfriend's wound has been dressed.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.300
Hurry to help him get dressed.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.420
Doc, he is not my...

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.980
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.500
I will go in.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.660
The doctor asked me to help you get dressed.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.620
It's all right. I can do it myself.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.300
Let me help you.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.540
There is blood on the T-shirt.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.220
I'd better put it on by myself.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.260
Give it to me.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.300
I will close my eyes.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.860
Where is it?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.740
This, this is the cuff.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.780
Am I doing it right?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.660
You are holding it reversely.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.220
OK.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:23.380
Your

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.340
injured hand.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.220
Sorry! Sorry!

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:35.220
Where is it?

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.140
Hold on. Hold on.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.260
The other side.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.300
Sorry.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.620
Where is your T-shirt on earth?

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.220
You can open your eyes now.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.140
You!

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.300
You obviously could have pulled your T-shirt
by yourself just now.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:01.300
Then I will pull it back.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.980
No need.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.460
I am not trying to follow you.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.340
This is the only way out.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.940
Well, I want to say that

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.780
thank you for what happened

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.900
in the library today.

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.020
Don't mention it.

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.020
Then I am leaving.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.460
I

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.540
need to have my dressing changed
three days later.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.340
Oh.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.020
Hello, mom!

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.340
Fanzhou.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.740
Did you get hurt in the earthquake?

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.060
No, I didn't.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.860
How about you?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.580
I am relieved to hear that.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.420
Both your dad and I are fine.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.380
How about Zhou Xiao?

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.780
Is she fine, too?

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:18.420
She is fine, too.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.380
Have you made up with each other?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.580
No, we haven't.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:24.540
Why haven't you made up with each other?

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.860
I will figure out a way for you.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.380
Mom, have a good rest.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.980
I can handle my own business.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.340
Is Fanzhou all right?

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.100
Yes, he is fine.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.260
You often worked overtime in the past.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.100
Why?

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.420
Don't you need to work overtime now?

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.700
I just want to stay with you today.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.020
From now on,

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.900
I will be able to spend
more and more time with you.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.700
Do you still remember that

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.220
when I was in college,
I often acted in plays?

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.740
My acting was quite good.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.500
Yes, but what is it about?

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.220
I have come up with an idea.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:36.460
Hello, mom!

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:37.660
Hello! Hello!

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.180
You inconsiderate girl!

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.660
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.100
Your dad has watched the news.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.500
The news said an earthquake
took place in your place.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.340
How are you?

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:46.020
Due to the earthquake,
I have poor cell phone reception.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020
I am fine. Don't worry.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.580
You dad said there would be the aftershock.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.620
Anyway, the National Day is drawing near.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.940
Hurry to come back home to avoid it.

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.260
Why need I avoid it?

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.860
You are making a fuss about it.

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.260
I will go back to my dorm.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.220
I got to go. Bye!

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:00.980
Take care!

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.060
How could she act like that?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.940
OK. Forget it. It is good that she is fine.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.100
How could she?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:12.740
In the wake of the earthquake,
why still the inspection of the dorm?

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.780
There will be no inspection.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.220
The school fears that
there may be an aftershock.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.860
So we are required to sleep
on the playground.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.140
This is making a mountain out of a molehill.

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:21.540
Hurry to pack up.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.100
Xie Yixing has secured the spot for us.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.340
All right.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.620
Tao Ling.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.460
Tao Ling.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.740
Won't you pack up?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:32.980
No, I won't.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.820
I am crossed in love.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:35.820
I don't want to stay alive any longer.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.020
The students who have come
to sleep on the playground,

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:51.020
may I have your attention, please?

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.180
With the halfway line of the football field
as the demarcation,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.460
and with an in-between distance
of about one meter,

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.100
male students shall stay on the left
and female students on the right.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.380
Thank you for your cooperation!

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.700
Whoa! So many people!

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.140
Where is Xie Yixing?

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.460
Lu, I am here.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:09.980
Let's go.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.340
Tao Ling, slow down!

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.020
Take care of your foot.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.820
It is not easy
to get the space for four people.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.060
Xie Yixing has spent a lot of time
securing the spot.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.460
Moreover,

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.180
Zhao Fanzhou has saved you today.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.340
You should show him some respect.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:39.980
Haven't you

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.260
been complaining the most about him?

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.260
I am impartial and fair.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.860
Look at him! He is alone.

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.860
How pathetic he is!

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.460
How come he is pathetic?

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.700
Move! Move!

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:50.540
Come on!

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.820
Come on! Let me give you a hand.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.100
Come on. Hold the pillow.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.780
Come on!

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:56.980
Come on! Hold this.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.940
Why is this thing so ugly?

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.620
How could you say that?

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.620
I have waited for such a long time.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.500
I have been sitting among the girls

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.820
to reserve this spot for you.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:08.820
Ah, enough!

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.220
Come on!

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.420
I will help you.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.500
What the heck?

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.260
Hug it while you sleep.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.620
I won't.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.740
You must.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.620
I won't.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.700
Xiao,

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.980
is Tao Ling all right?

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.220
Just let her sleep.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:39.180
She will be better after the sleep.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.340
Xiao,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.820
I will go to bed first.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.060
Hmm, OK.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:02.940
Well,

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.180
it is late now.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:04.820
You should go to bed.

00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:07.540
After you.

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.860
No, you must go to bed before me.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.980
Have a sleep first!

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.020
OK, let's have a sleep.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.740
Good night!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.620
Good night!

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.220
Good night!

Hello! Are you in the dorm?

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:12.220
Get Tao Ling out of her bed.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.180
I have bought her breakfast.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:14.980
I have done such a moving thing.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.500
On a weekend day, I got up early and queued

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.100
to buy breakfast for my lovelorn roommate.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.700
She won't get up,

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.020
saying she has the right to do
whatever she likes as a lovelorn person.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.300
Then tell her I will eat the chive dumplings

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.420
that she likes the best.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:27.860
She is getting up.

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:30.300
As I expected.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:31.020
Ask...

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:37.100
(Zhao Fanzhou's Mom)

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.460
Hello, Mrs. Zhao!

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.620
Zhou Xiao.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.860
This is Zhao Fanzhou's mom calling you.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:46.900
Do you still remember me?

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.140
Of course I do.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.340
How have your body recovered recently?

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.380
It has almost fully recovered.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.660
I have been discharged from the hospital.

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:55.300
Then I have been busy tidying up our house.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.300
Thus, I didn't call you till now.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.940
Am I disturbing you?

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:00.940
No, you are not.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:03.020
I am supposed to pay you a visit.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.620
Then why haven't you come?

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.420
Huh?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.100
Zhou Xiao,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:09.980
I know

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.700
what happened between you and Fanzhou.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.340
But I really like you.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.260
I regard you as a friend.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.020
Could our relation remain unchanged

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:21.060
despite such a happening?

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.180
Yes.

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:27.220
That's great!

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.740
It happens to be the weekend.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.100
I have made the soup.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.700
Come and have lunch with me.

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.100
I will send you the address
of our home, all right?

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.940
But I...

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.220
Well,

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.940
don't worry.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.380
Just the two of us.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.340
OK. I got it, Mrs. Zhao.

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.380
Hello, Mrs. Zhao!

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:11.420
Glad to see you, Zhou Xiao.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.340
Come on in!

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.220
Three, four.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:23.940
You are good at this.

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:25.580
Mrs. Zhao.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.020
Yes?

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.220
When shall we have the meal?

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.220
No need to rush.
Help me clear the game first.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.220
But the food has been served.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.220
It will get cold if not eaten.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.660
Let me finish this game.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:37.460
OK.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.260
Someone is arriving.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.980
Huh? Who is it?

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.060
I will go check who is coming.

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.580
OK.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:55.140
Mom, I am back.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:56.980
Fanzhou,

00:20:57.340 --> 00:20:59.100
why do you suddenly come back?

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.860
You asked me...

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.060
Why didn't you call me before coming back?

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.580
I have invited Zhou Xiao over
to have a meal today.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:13.300
Zhou Xiao,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:15.260
I am sorry!

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.100
I really didn't know he would come back.

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.740
If you feel embarrassed,

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:20.900
I will ask him to leave.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:21.860
Go! Go! Go!

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.180
Leave here.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:24.100
It's all right, Mrs. Zhao.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.180
Really?

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:29.620
Yes.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.220
It doesn't matter.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:32.660
Then we can have the meal together.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:34.500
Come on!

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.540
Come on! Let's eat together.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.260
Sit here.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.380
Come on.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:38.980
Here.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:42.860
Fanzhou.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:43.460
Take a seat.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.020
Hmm.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.180
Come on. Sit here.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.780
I am back.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.380
Dad.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:54.740
Oh!

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.980
You are all here.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.900
Why do you

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:00.620
come back so unexpectedly?

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.460
Our company gave us some mooncakes
for the Mid-Autumn Festival.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.300
So I brought them home.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:05.740
Hello, Mr. Zhao!

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:08.260
She is Zhou Xiao. You have met her before.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:08.980
Yes, I know her.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.380
It has been a long time
since we met last time.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:13.900
Fanzhou,

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.380
why is your face so red?

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.140
Aah!

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.820
Fanzhou is in front of the girl he loves.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:21.820
Surely, he blushes.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.860
Why can't you see?

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.340
Well,

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.180
he never blushes.

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:27.380
He is like me in this aspect.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.420
Could it be possible that you've got a fever?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:31.940
It really feels hot.

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.580
Touch it. Come over. Come over.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:39.420
When I called you,

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.580
you told me you were fine, right?

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.260
How come you have got injured?

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.500
Moreover, your wound is inflamed.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:45.380
What happened on earth?

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.340
It's nothing.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.300
Something fell down suddenly

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.060
and I was hit out of carelessness.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:52.620
Why didn't you dodge?

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.300
You two are hiding something from me, right?

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.260
Zhou Xiao,

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.180
tell me what it is.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.100
Don't mind him.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.420
Mrs. Zhao,

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.100
he

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:13.780
saved someone.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.300
It is a good deed to save others.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:18.900
Why were you hesitating to tell it?

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.580
He has been like this since childhood.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.260
Whenever he did a good deed,
he didn't tell others.

00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.060
Tell me.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.260
Whom has he saved?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:26.940
Mrs. Zhao.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:30.500
It was me.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:34.060
You?

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.420
He saved me.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.260
Zhou Xiao.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.100
In my son's mind,

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.100
you're more important than himself.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.580
Mrs. Zhao, I'd better leave now for today.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.740
I will come to visit you some other day.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.620
Why should you?

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:00.860
Then I will see you off.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:01.660
Stay a little longer.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:02.900
Zhou Xiao.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:03.660
I found it. I found it.

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:04.580
I found it.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.660
Here is the anti-inflammatory drug.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:14.820
It is expired.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.420
Is it?

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.500
Is it expired?

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:19.780
Well, I didn't...

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.100
It is expired.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.060
Oh.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.940
I didn't see clearly.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:27.700
What should we do?

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.180
Go buy some new drug.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.100
Let's go.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.900
Well, Mrs. Zhao,

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:32.100
how about I go to buy the drug?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.100
You must drive a car
even if going to the nearest drugstore.

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.460
We'd better go buy the drug.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.260
Right. Exactly.

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.500
Help me take care of Fanzhou.

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.780
Don't let him fall in a faint.

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:43.300
All right?

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.860
Then we are leaving.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.300
Let's go.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.020
Oops!

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.540
I feel very dizzy.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.100
Take a seat.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:01.980
Hmm.

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:17.180
(Lock Status)

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:17.940
What are you doing?

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.900
I locked the door from outside.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.140
Thus, they won't be able to get out.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:28.660
Are you all right?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:32.420
I am fine, but feel a bit dizzy.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.100
Do you want to drink some water?

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.660
I will fetch some water for you.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:38.820
OK.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.460
Mengjun,

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.660
today

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:55.020
you have put on an excellent performance.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.180
Good!

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.620
I have figured out what to say

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:00.740
to make them get back together.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.940
I didn't expect you came uninvited.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.180
I have to improvise in my action.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.660
Zhao Jian,

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:09.860
when you are free,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.060
I hope you can prepare the divorce agreement.

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:14.580
Mengjun...

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.660
Well,

00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.820
we have been torturing each other
for so long.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:21.860
I have made up my mind.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.380
Mengjun, listen to me.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.820
Enough.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:27.460
Stop talking.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.980
Anyway, Mrs. Zhao won't pick up the phone,

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.060
and you are running a fever.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.300
I'd better go buy the drug for you.

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:16.740
I will go with you.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.780
You are running a fever. You don't need to.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.580
Then I will escort you out.

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.620
Wait a sec.
I will finish putting on my shoes soon.

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.820
I've said that you need not follow me.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.140
Wait for me for a moment.

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.060
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.300
why can't the door be opened?

00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.180
How come?

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.460
It functioned properly when I came here.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.620
I don't know.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.020
I know nothing about it.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.300
Can you come up with any other ways?

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.860
Other ways?

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:16.860
No, I can't.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:19.740
What should we do?

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.420
We can't go out.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:24.540
Well.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.500
Shall we have the meal first?

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.340
Anyway,

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.100
you are hungry.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.180
So am I.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.340
Fine.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.380
Then I will go heat the dishes on the table.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.260
Wait for me.

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.220
Wait for me for a moment.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.580
Let me do it. You are running a fever.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.500
It doesn't matter. I'll do it.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.860
You ran away so quickly.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.500
Why are you looking at me?

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:20.140
Will you eat or not?

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:21.700
If you don't eat, I will leave.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:23.140
I will eat. I will eat.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:23.700
I'm eating.

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:33.100
I'm eating.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.580
I,

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:37.580
I'm eating.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:39.020
I am really eating.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.860
I just wanted to watch TV in the living room.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.420
Enjoy the dishes.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.300
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.060
Yes?

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:16.860
This drug isn't expired.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.900
In your opinion,
has Mrs. Zhao misread the words

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.740
or has she done this on purpose?

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:44.860
I really

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:45.900
have no idea.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:12.580
Have you finished taking the temperature?

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.300
Yeah,

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:14.140
I have.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.820
38.3 degrees Celsius.

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.420
Hurry to sleep for a while.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.180
I will come to check
whether your fever is brought down later.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.780
It's all right. I am not sleepy.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.060
Go to sleep!

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.580
OK.

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.340
What?

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:41.980
You...

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.260
You won't leave, will you?

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.940
I won't.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:48.780
Really?

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:51.900
I must go out first if I want to leave.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.420
Zhou Xiao.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.180
What is it this time?

00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.700
Could you

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:01.140
help me

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.100
fetch my earphones
from my backpack downstairs.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.500
I can't fall asleep
without listening to a song.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.780
OK, young master.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:10.700
So troublesome!

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.900
Should I

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.180
forgive you or not?

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.100
Sweet voice print?

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.940
Is it for voice print identification?

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.140
Is it used to crack a case?

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:50.780
You...

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.260
You can't misunderstand me.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.340
I was just curious about
what you are listening to.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:33:59.980
I...

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.260
I am listening to nothing special.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:03.620
Nothing special?

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.820
Then why can't you

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:06.180
fall asleep without listening to it.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.620
I heard it.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.020
It is the snore.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.420
Whose snore is it?

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:22.500
My snore?

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.380
When did you record it?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.180
Delete it!

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.340
No, I can't.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:47.220
If it is deleted,
I won't be able to fall asleep later.

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.620
Where are you going?

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.140
I will break the window to escape.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.020
Go back to your bed.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:05.740
Zhou Xiao.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.060
Zhou Xiao.

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.060
Take your temperature again.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.260
OK.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.380
Give it to me.

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.140
Hmm.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.980
Whoa!

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.540
42 degrees Celsius.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.300
The thermometer will explode due to the heat.

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.100
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:39.940
Are you fooling me?

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.220
Do you think I am a fool?

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.380
I am sorry!

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:49.220
Let go of me!

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:50.460
No, I won't.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.540
Let go of me.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.620
I won't.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.420
Let go of me!

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:01.460
What do you want on earth?

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.060
Sorry.

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:13.540
I was wrong.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.380
Except saying sorry, what else can you say?

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.060
Could you please forgive me?

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:22.860
No, I can't.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.180
I will change for sure.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.700
I don't care.

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.820
Please give me another chance.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.220
Just let me go.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:02.300
I won't let you leave me again.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.740
Please give one more chance.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:05.820
No need.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:11.820
If you are sleepy,

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.740
you can sleep in the guest room.

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.620
Mrs. Zhao said she would come back
in a while, right?

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.900
I will wait for her return
and go back to school for sleep.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.340
She said this an hour ago, but...

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.020
Zhou Xiao.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.180
I was locked in the exhibition hall.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.340
Do you have the key with you?

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:39.860
Come to open the door for me.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:41.660
Lu,

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.100
I am coming. Don't be scared.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.060
What is the sound in your place?

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:53.500
Xie Yixing is banging on the door.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.100
Come quickly.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.380
If you don't, Xie Yixing will have to
compensate for a broken door.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:00.300
Well, wait for a moment.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.380
I, I will go there in a while.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:03.580
I will hang up. I got to go.

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.460
Goodbye!

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.020
Listen to me.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.380
Now, the most important thing for you

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.900
is to keep calm.

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:09.540
Do you understand?

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.380
Listen to me.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.180
Stop bumping against the door.

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.100
Zhou Xiao will be here soon.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.060
Stay quiet for a while.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.260
Don't be scared.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:24.940
I will be here with you.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.540
What should I do?

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.420
Lu is locked in the exhibition hall.

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.900
I have the spare key with me.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.340
I must go back to unlock the door for her.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:35.820
What?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.300
What are you doing?

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.860
Looking for a way out.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.220
We must figure out a way.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.580
Let's go.

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:44.380
Where?

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:46.340
Go unlock the door.

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.060
The door is locked. Don't you know?

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:49.420
I can unlock the door with my mobile phone.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.180
I swear.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.660
Except this,

00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.940
I really know nothing

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.900
about other things.

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.940
Lazy Ling,

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.980
why have you got up so early?

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:47.980
Wei,

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.460
I will study together with you.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.700
From today onward,

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.260
you will be my role model.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:53.740
I will learn from you

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.180
and become a positive
and hard-working person.

00:41:55.620 --> 00:41:57.180
I will study for a master's degree
and a doctoral degree.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:58.820
I will prove myself to Fang Wei.

00:41:59.140 --> 00:41:59.940
But...

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.220
But what?

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.300
I am no longer the lazy person I used to be.

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:05.540
Now I fear no hardship and difficulty.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.460
I didn't mean that.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.020
I meant I have to go outside of the school

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:12.300
to attend the dance lectures today.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:14.660
Hmm.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.060
You can study by yourself now.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.460
I will come to join you later.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:22.140
No need.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.220
I will go have a sleep.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.260
I will have a sleep first.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:25.500
What?

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:30.220
Zhou Xiao.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.140
Zhou Xiao.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.380
Zhou Xiao.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.740
Zhou Xiao, get up.

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:45.540
You asked me to wake you up, right?

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.260
You said you would accompany Zhao Fanzhou
to attend class.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.180
Right.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:59.980
I'd better give it up.

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:00.780
Ah?

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:04.660
I don't want to accompany Zhao Fanzhou
to attend class now.

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.700
You

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.220
have made up with each other, right?

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.220
What is wrong, Zhou Xiao?

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:16.860
Wei,

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:19.020
do you know this feeling?

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:21.060
After two people in love

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.780
break up and then make up with each other,

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.060
there will be

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.980
an ineffable estrangement
and embarrassment between them.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.340
They will

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.820
feel worried and can't dispel this feeling.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:31.620
They will fear that the other person

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.980
may want to split up again suddenly.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.380
Therefore, they dare not give it all again.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.540
All in all, I don't feel comfortable
in this relationship now.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:39.900
I,

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.220
I dare not face him again.

00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.740
What should I do?

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:44.740
Do you understand?

00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.420
How should I describe it?

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:54.900
It's a feeling that I worry about
personal gains and losses.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.780
Why can't you understand?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.820
Perhaps,

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.380
it is because I have never been in love.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:08.940
Yes. Exactly.

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:13.460
Well, my rough idea is that

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.500
I dare not get too close
to the person I hold dearest.

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:18.980
Do you know?

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.100
It is that kind of...

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.860
Shut up!

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.940
What nonsense!

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.220
You have made up with each other for real.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:26.260
Don't show off your love here.

00:44:26.260 --> 00:44:26.780
Hey, guys!

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:30.420
Why are you making so much noise?

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.740
Can you allow me to sleep a little longer?

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.060
I'm having a date with Xie Yixing later.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:37.780
There is nothing special about a date.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:38.820
Wei,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.180
I don't support you to be in love.

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.300
A love relationship is meaningless.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:42.900
Wei,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:44.860
I support you to be in love.

00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.420
A romantic relationship makes people happy.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.420
I am against it.

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.220
I am for it.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:48.980
Shut up!

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:49.660
You shut up!

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:50.700
One, two, three! Shut up together.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.340
One, two, three.

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.820
Will you get up or not?

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:06.340
No, I won't. Good night!

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:13.900
Seeing what my roommates look like
when they are in love,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.700
who still dares to fall in love?

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:23.700
(Next Episode)
Zhu Lu, I want to tell you that

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.460
I am very happy to be in love with you.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:27.540
It has been a long time.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:28.820
Yes, it has been a long time.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:30.340
Haven't they broken up with each other?

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.500
But they have got back together,
haven't they?

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.820
