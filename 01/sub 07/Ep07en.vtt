00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.340
Did it break? Quick!  Have a look at it.

23
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.790
Look at it and see if it broke.

24
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.170
Is it broken? Look at it.

25
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.800
Don't look at me like that.

26
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.060
It's not some big deal, I'll buy you a new one.

27
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.830
Why did you catch me instead of it? It's not like I'll break when I fall. How much does it cost?

28
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.730
- ¥3000. 
 - ¥3000?
<i>(about $423)</i>

29
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.500
Y-You're usually so stingy. But you were willing to spend so much on this.

30
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.010
I'm stingy? Is that something you should say after breaking my things?

31
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.190
Big Bro, seeing as we've known each other for so many years already,

32
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.820
you've also used it for quite a while. It's not worth ¥3000, right?

33
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.740
It's not broken.

34
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.160
Really? What a relief.

35
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.160
Like I was thinking, how could it be? You're so—

36
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.770
You can play with it. I-I'm busy. I'm going to class now.

37
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.790
What a psycho.

38
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.400
Luckily, it's not broken. I still haven't finished paying back the money that I owe Zhao Fanzhou.

39
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.300
Excuse me.

40
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.610
Yasi, you're here so early.

41
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.690
Yeah. Why are you here so early?

42
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.120
There's still an hour until the Programming Technique class.

43
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.010
Did you come here to do something bad?

44
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.240
Why are you guys here?

45
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.660
Don't mention it. The internet in the dormitory is so slow.

46
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.710
It keeps disconnecting when we're playing.

47
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.760
Yasi, let's play a round together.

48
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.450
I'm not playing.

49
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.810
You have nothing else to do, why don't you join us?

50
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.560
The school wants to re-form the ACM team. I don't have time to spare.

51
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.620
Yasi, you deserve your title as the "Master."

52
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.490
Zhang Lin what are you doing? Hurry up.

53
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.700
I'm looking at the newly released skins. How do they look?

54
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.020
So expensive. You're so rich.

55
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.300
But this doesn't give you any additional skills. Why did you buy it?

56
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.220
Actually, I've been hesitating for quite some time. How about

57
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.460
I clench my teeth and just go for it.

58
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.190
You should think it over first. You may like it now,

59
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.360
but what if you purchase it on impulse and then instantly regret it after.

60
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.400
Right. It was just a spur of the moment.

61
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.410
Xiao,  I've already sent you the draft.

62
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.950
Tao Ling and Luo Wei are currently transforming the room based on the picture.

63
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.550
All we need now is a skeleton. Can you figure out a way to get one? Okay.

64
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.610
All right. Bye-bye.

65
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.150
Why are you here again?

66
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.750
I already took on the job.

67
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.810
It may be a bit tiring, but I think it's quite fun.

68
00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.600
Okay then. I hope you have a good time.

69
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.370
You don't even know. My legs were so sore last night I couldn't even fall asleep.

70
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.660
I didn't think this would be even more tiring than training.

71
00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.160
How many days have you been here? Aren't you tired?

72
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.050
But you also

73
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.290
have such a nice sofa to sit on, it's probably not as tiring.

74
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.870
Hey!

75
00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.110
How about we switch?

76
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.600
I'll be the sitting Fifer (Young Flautist) and you'll be the standing Re...

77
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:51.290
Madame Recamier.

78
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.020
I think that's pretty good.

79
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.860
You chatter nonstop... Did you wind up your mouth?

80
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.750
So you're not mute? I thought you were mute.

81
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.650
Give it back to me.

82
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.740
Why are you so strong?

83
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.160
I guess our celebrity coach took a leave to work here.

84
00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.610
You're here.

85
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.000
Xiao Lu, you look really pretty and your stature is amazing.

86
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.050
Thank you. I didn't think you would actually come.

87
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.030
How about me? Am I not handsome? Why did you only compliment her?

88
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.700
You are also really handsome.

89
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.530
How about we take a picture?

90
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.240
- Sure. 
 - Okay.

91
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.400
Ready?

92
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.660
1, 2, 3.

93
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.500
Move.

94
00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.800
- How about we take another one?
- Okay.

95
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:14.020
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

96
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.810
The exhibition is about to start. Hurry up and go back to your post.

97
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.190
Then I'll go look around.

98
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.330
- Keep working hard! 
 - Wait.

99
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.750
Since you especially came to the exhibition, how about I treat you to a meal as a thank you?

100
00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.360
I'll come, too.

101
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.680
Okay, I'll treat you guys.

102
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.200
- Okay. 
 - Forget it then.

103
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.260
I just remembered I have to go back to the dorm for the contest.

104
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.700
Okay, then maybe next time. I'll get going now.

105
00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.570
Okay, bye-bye.

106
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.290
You're a girl. All you think about is treating guys to meals. Do you know how to be reserved?

107
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.020
No. Who told you girls had to be reserved?

108
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.500
- Do you really want a boyfriend that bad? 
 - Yeah, so what? It's none of your business.

109
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.100
Then consider me. I'm handsome, rich, and a celebrity.

110
00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.070
I'm the number one most datable male athlete on Tencent's Hot Chart. You're making a fortune.

111
00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:24.550
With this fortune, you should keep it yourself.

112
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.220
You're completely unreasonable.

113
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:44.250
The method of using magnetic beads to extract DNA can be simply said as

114
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.360
adding decomposing liquid,

115
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:50.470
add magnetic beads, separate the magnetic beads, wash it away.

116
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.470
This results in pure nucleic acid.

117
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.120
Don't forget the oscillation in the process.

118
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.570
Got it.

119
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.990
You're learning this next semester. How do you know the steps so well?

120
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:13.440
I already watched a video about this before I came.

121
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:22.200
Everyone else dates or hangs out during their free time, and I won't expect that of you.

122
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.930
But you should go outside sometimes and interact more with people.

123
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.600
Don't stay in the lab all day with your old professor.

124
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:35.000
If you do all my work, what am I supposed to do?

125
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.590
No. Leave now. You can do whatever you want.

126
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:45.370
I have to work on this lab until night time, just come back then.

127
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.960
Professor, I won't leave the lab today.

128
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.490
<i>Is anyone there? Professor Hu?</i>

129
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.080
It's you again. Who are you looking for? Are you looking for Zhao Fanzhou?

130
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.550
No. I'm looking for you. My most respected Professor Hu.

131
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.710
Do I know you that well?

132
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.500
Although I'm a normal student to you,

133
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.490
but ever since I attended your class

134
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.220
you are my source of inspiration and muse goddess.

135
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:24.690
Okay, stop there. Don't randomly compliment me.

136
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.220
Goddess? Since when did I change genders?

137
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.100
What? Did you come to the lab for inspiration again?

138
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:36.440
No. This time is different. This time I'm here to borrow your skeleton model.

139
00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.580
Why do you need that?

140
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:42.760
We've recently been preparing for a Dormitory Creativity Contest. It's to decorate our dorm.

141
00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.750
What does your dorm decorating have to do with me?

142
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:51.490
You've read my writing and I've attended your class.

143
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:55.130
Our fates are so unique, you can't refuse to let me borrow it.

144
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:03.120
But our lab has strict rules with our equipment, we can't randomly let others borrow it.

145
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.690
But I...

146
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.130
You're here, too? Help me persuade your professor. He won't listen to me.

147
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.640
No matter who tries to persuade me, it's still of no use. Even a professor can't violate the rules.

148
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.660
Also, I treasure these teaching materials.

149
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.720
Professor, you're drinking tea out of a beaker.

150
00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:27.160
Are you still my student? You're undermining me in front of her.

151
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.010
Let me tell you. This girl writes negatively about us forensic scientists, so there's no way I'm lending it to her.

152
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:42.030
- Professor, you're really disappointing me.
- How so?

153
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:47.240
You're giving up on my writing? I just updated two chapters.

154
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.230
I just reversed your forensic science's undercover identity.

155
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.540
This is the inspiration you gave me.

156
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:56.080
But you actually gave up on my writing? You stopped reading?

157
00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.350
I didn't really.

158
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.290
I am just really busy recently, right?

159
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.110
Never mind then. I'm the one that is useless.

160
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.150
It's me who couldn't keep a reader. I'll go, I'll go.

161
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.830
Fine, fine. I'll lend it to you, okay?

162
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.260
Thank you, Professor.

163
00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:25.410
Don't thank me. Thank him.

164
00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.990
<i>[Forensic Science Lab]</i>

165
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:37.220
This plot twist is pretty interesting.

166
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.660
It's just too short. Can you write some more?

167
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.790
There's something even more interesting later on.

168
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:48.890
Professor, in order to thank you for your generosity today, I'll send you the latest chapter of my novel when I get back.

169
00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.520
In the future, if you have a new chapter, you can send it directly to my WeChat.

170
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.470
I'll be your forensic science adviser and help fix mistakes.

171
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.510
Deal!

172
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.850
Thank you.

173
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.990
Go ahead and give it to me.

174
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:05.890
Be careful.

175
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.490
This...

176
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.260
Be careful. Don't hurt yourself.

177
00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.740
Don't worry. I'll be fine. Let go.

178
00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.150
We're going now.

179
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:38.320
You want to go with her? Then go.

180
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.020
Do you really not worry about giving her that skeleton. Go keep an eye on it for me.

181
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.990
Thank you, Professor.

182
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.170
Hurry up and change.

183
00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.890
Why isn't there an ice cream vending machine?

184
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.350
If I could have a cantaloupe flavored ice cream right about now, that would be great.

185
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.140
Your demands are quite specific.

186
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.680
Why are you here? Do you have anything else to tell me?

187
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.260
I'll escort you.

188
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.390
Why?

189
00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.170
I'm worried about him leaving home by himself.

190
00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.190
Wait there for me. I'll buy you some ice cream.

191
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.370
Why are you buying me ice cream?

192
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:10.290
Why do I feel like Zhao Fanzhou is acting so weird lately?

193
00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:14.730
Always appearing near me. I don't even know him that well.

194
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.230
You know him well. Don't you think he's weird?

195
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.460
Is he trying to remind me to hurry and pay him back?

196
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:32.360
How about I ask him directly? What do you think?

197
00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:36.830
Thank you.

198
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.430
What do you want to say?

199
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.740
Why have you been appearing near me recently?

200
00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.840
And you're being so good to me.

201
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:19.390
What do you think?

202
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.560
Let me think.

203
00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.830
You suddenly appeared on the school road.

204
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.630
Gave me a book. There were no marks on the book.

205
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:35.770
Which means it hasn't been borrowed out yet.

206
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:39.030
You used your job at the library to get a copy of the book first.

207
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.030
And then I said I needed to go to the grocery store. You said you were going, too.

208
00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.080
But then when we left the store, you didn't buy anything.

209
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.920
<i>Oh right! These things are all mine.</i>

210
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.840
<i>Don't you also need to buy anything? Why didn't you get anything?</i>

211
00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.210
<i>Go and collect our bags.</i>

212
00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.310
<i>Okay.</i>

213
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.330
Which means you found an excuse to go with me.

214
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:07.460
And then you helped speak for me so I could borrow the skeleton.

215
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.550
<i>Even a professor can't violate the rules.</i>

216
00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:13.620
<i>Also, I treasure these teaching materials.</i>

217
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.700
<i>Professor, you're drinking tea out of a beaker.</i>

218
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.670
<i>Are you still my student? You're undermining me in front of her.</i>

219
00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.960
You not only bought me ice cream, but you also said you would escort me back.

220
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.170
All the signs show that you feel like...

221
00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:42.000
you owe me!

222
00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.790
I'm not wrong, am I?

223
00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:51.220
You feel like you owe me because you accidentally kissed my forehead at the lab the other day.

224
00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:00.300
It's okay. Stop sighing.

225
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.820
That was a particular situation. I know you didn't mean it. I didn't put it to heart.

226
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:07.600
Don't worry about it.

227
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.560
What if I do care about it?

228
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.270
<i> What is Zhao Fanzhou trying to say? </i>

229
00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:59.620
<i> What does he mean by "what if I care"? </i>

230
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.970
<i> Does he think I'm the one who owes him? I should be the one who compensates? </i>

231
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.860
Who cares if he cares? I'm not going to curry favor with him.

232
00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:14.850
You came back?

233
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.000
How's the dorm?

234
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.330
Not bad, right? No wonder you're my buddy. This is how you know what's what.

235
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.450
Let me tell you how angry I was today.

236
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.440
Do you remember Zhu Lu from the escape room activity?

237
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.350
I don't remember.

238
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:40.920
The one who's roommates with the  Detective Club's President Zhou Xiao. The prettiest one.

239
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.980
I don't think so.

240
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.330
How did you become blind? But that's not the main point.

241
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:49.690
The main point is I confessed to her today.

242
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.330
But then I got rejected.

243
00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:54.370
Rejected me. Rejected Xie Yixing.

244
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:58.950
If this story goes out, people will hit her.

245
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:01.140
That's perfect revenge.

246
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.000
I'm being serious. Can you take me seriously?

247
00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.690
The question is... How come she doesn't like me?

248
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.410
Could it be that there was a problem with my confession

249
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:15.070
or I shouldn't have confessed at all?

250
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:19.910
That's not right. If you like someone then shouldn't you go confess to them immediately?

251
00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.490
That's why you got rejected.

252
00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:26.610
Then tell me what I should do.

253
00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.240
Don't fight in a battle of uncertainty.

254
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.810
But I can't hold it in!

255
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.000
Forget it. There's no point in asking you

256
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.770
since you have no experience.

257

<i> Southern University's Dormitory Creativity Contest has come to a successful end. </i>

<i> The students' brilliant imaginations were able to be displayed to the fullest potential for this contest.</i>

<i>There was definitely dirty tricks involved!</i>

Don't rip it.

262
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.160
You reason things out. With my celebrity halo adding support,

263
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.570
why didn't we get first place?

264
00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.360
They were definitely envious of my handsomeness.

267
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.750
Really?

268
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.650

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.840
Tao Ling, hurry and wake up.

272
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.330
Our dorm won.

273

Really?

274
00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.350
Then hurry up and take them down. I don't even have enough room to turn my body.

275
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.730
Okay.

276
00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.280
Here.

I brought you guys lunch.

Hurry and wake up to eat.

279
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.520
Was there an explosion?

280
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:52.480
Hurry and get up.

281
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.390
You guys haven't gotten up since finishing yesterday's CET4. 
<i>(College English Test Band 4)</i>

282
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.570
Lazy Ling-ling, if you still don't get up,

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:04.110
then I'll go up to look for you.

I beg you. Go wake up Xiao Lu and Zhou Xiao.

287
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.350
Zhou Xiao already got up.

288
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.810
Xiao Lu went out with me this morning.

289

She went to go train.

get up and drink this.

It's getting cold these days.

You guys stayed up late every day to study for the test.

Look at your face and how it looks right now.

295

Don't get sick and drink it.

296
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.110
I'm going to study.

297
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:52.700
Didn't you just come back? Why are you going out again?

298
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.240
I came back to bring food for you guys.

Hello.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.210
It's about the payment installments.

313
00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.710
You're in a rush to use money, right?

314
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.380
<i>I'll think of a way to return it.</i>

315
00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:02.820
What I want to tell you is that the library is looking for part-timers.

316
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:07.060
If you want to finish paying off the debt soon, then you can reconsider it.

317
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:09.770
Really? I'll go submit my resume in a bit.

318
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.560
Thank you, bye-bye.

319
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.130
Wait a second.

320
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:15.290
Is there anything else?

321
00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.620
Come to the Forensic Science Lab.

322
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.500
Why?

323
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.450
Return the skeleton.

324
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.710
That's right. Sorry, I was so busy that I forgot.

325
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:30.700
I was busy with the CET4 the past few days.

326
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.010
I'll bring it over later.

327
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.700
Okay. I'll wait for you.

328
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.320
What is there to wait for?

329
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:50.570
If there's no one, I'll just give it to the security guard.

330
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.500
Reconsider it.

331
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.460
Don't reject it so quickly.

332
00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.140
No.

333
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.680
We already got defeated by the Southern Sports University two years in a row for the interschool league matches.

334
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.700
I hope to be able to beat them sometime in my time as the president of the badminton club.

335
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.330
Then practice hard. Play well.

336
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.260
Why are you not participating?

337
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.230
Is it because your nemesis Li Xiaofeng is on their team?

338
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.580
Are you kidding?

339
00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.930
Have you ever heard of a first-place winner being scared of a second-place player?

340
00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.850
Then, why are you not participating?

341
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:24.170
You need to give me a reason.

342
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.560
It's because this type of tournament isn't on my level.

343
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.450
You even use English?

344
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.190
Do you even know how to spell "level"?

345
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:36.100
Why do you keep arguing with me? Why don't I know how to spell it?

346
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.190
- I took the CET4 before, too.
- Then spell it.

347
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:40.070
Fine, I'll spell it.

348
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.060
L. E. V...

349
00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:50.670
Why do I have to spell it just because you asked? I'm not going to spell it.

350
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.470
It's not embarrassing if you don't know how to spell it, it's only embarrassing if you won't admit it.

351
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.020
Who's embarrassing?

352
00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:59.040
I'm talking about you.

353
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:01.340
I know how to spell any word.

354
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.610
Abandon. A B A N D O N.

355
00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.690
Sit down. That's not the main point.

356
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.640
The main point is to take that I'm begging you. Please participate in this tournament.

357
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.280
I'm not participating.

358
00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.800
No need for him to participate.

359
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.850
Watch us bring back both the Women and Mixed Doubles championship.

360
00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.160
We can win even without him.

361
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.790
Looks like someone isn't aware they're in a sports university.

362
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.450
- So what? 
 - Nothing. Good luck.

363
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.040
Without him, it'll really be hard for us to win.

364
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.000
Sorry.

365
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.690
I just can't look past his attitude and I was so mad.

366
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.030
Don't worry, I'll practice hard.

367
00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.890
It's okay. I believe in you.

368
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.540
Then I'm off to practice.

369
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.990
Good luck.

370
00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.910
Serve.

371
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.390
<i>I haven't seen you for days. Where did you go?</i>

372
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:08.260
<i>I'll treat you to a meal at the cafeteria.</i>

373
00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.200
What are you doing? You're always looking around.

374
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.940
Nothing.

375
00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.820
<i>Cai Yasi!</i>

376
00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.780
Come and help me.

377
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:30.620
Who's that? It's a little creepy.

378
00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.990
You guys know each other?

379
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:37.180
Does she have a boyfriend? Introduce me.

380
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.360
We grew up together.

381
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.320
Help me out and bring this to the medical school.

382
00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.850
What is this?

383
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.070
I borrowed it for the dorm creativity contest.

384
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.190
Hi, classmate. I'm Cai Yasi's roommate.

385
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:52.750
My name is Zhang Lin.

386
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.670
Hi.

387
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.620
Hold this.

388
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.720
I— Slow down!

389
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.860
You can't hold it yourself?

390
00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.000
You're robust like Fong Saiyuk. Don't pretend to be Lin Daiyu. 
<i>(T/N: Fong Saiyuk was a Chinese martial artist and folk hero; Lin Daiyu is a lady known for her physical frailness)</i>

391
00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:10.090
What are you looking at? Come with me.

392
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:12.690
<i> Let go— </i>

393
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:15.970
Fine, if you don't want to help. What's with the personal attack?

394
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:18.040
Lunatic.

395
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.030
Let go!

396
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.870
Let go. Let go!

397
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.490
Are you trying to murder me?

398
00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.160
I'm warning you!  Don't try having any thoughts about my friend.

399
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.240
I was wondering what's with this big reaction.

400
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.780
Turns out she moved your cheese. 
<i> (T/N: A metaphor meaning something/someone you want to get)</i>

401
00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:42.660
Why didn't you say so earlier? I'm quick to catch on.

402
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.520
What cheese?

403
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.320
How's it possible between me and her?

404
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.400
I'm not that type of person.

405
00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.520
It's okay, brother. You don't need to pretend.

406
00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.770
If you don't admit, I'll go after her.

407
00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.440
Don't add to the mess. I'm already annoyed.

408
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.710
What's annoying?

409
00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:13.470
If you like her, then go after her.

410
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.530
We have a special circumstance.

411
00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:20.540
We grew up together.

412
00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.220
If my confession fails, we can't even be friends anymore.

413
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.030
How awkward.

414
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:32.280
If you don't try, you'll stay as a friend forever.

415
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.440
Think about it.

416
00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.060
<i>Be careful when bringing the specimen back to the lab.</i>

417
00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.020
<i>Next time, find something to cover it so you don't scare the students from other departments.</i>

418
00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.200
<i>Remember to complete the registration and close the door properly.</i>

419
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.520
Also, lock the door!

420
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.050
<i>- Understood, Professor. 
 - Understood, Professor.</i>

421
00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:36.380
Professor.

422
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.320
Someone downstairs must've gotten shocked.

423
00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:46.690
The freshmen just finished the Skull Anatomy Class

424
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:50.210
and they're bringing back the specimens. They didn't even think to find something to cover them.

425
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:51.690
Those kids...

426
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:54.170
Professor, I'll be leaving now.

427
00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.910
Why is he in such a hurry?

428
00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.830
I still need to tell you something.

429
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.690
<i>[Zhao Fanzhou]</i>

430
00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:13.050
So noisy.

431
00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.650
Who's phone is it?

432
00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:28.130
<i>Sorry, the user you have dialed is unable to answer the phone right now.</i>

433
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.160
<i>Please try again later.</i>

434
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.370
I'm finally bringing you back home.

435
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:45.790
It has been a pleasure knowing you. Come over to play when you're free.

436
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:47.450
Zhou Xiao.

437
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.800
Senior, you're lab coat...

438
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.020
- I'll collect it later in the Anatomy Room. 
 - Okay.

439
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:05.750
What are they holding?

440
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.460
A skull.

441
00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.040
A skull? I want to have a look.

442
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.890
You're not scared?

443
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.230
Nevermind, I'm a little scared.

444
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.960
Let's go.

445
00:34:29.950 --> 00:34:33.410
Thank you for what just happened.

446
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:43.050
It's just... you prevented me from seeing the skull.

447
00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:46.570
You're welcome.

448
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:51.900
<i>[Boys Apartment]</i>

<i>Where are you? Why aren't you answering your phone?</i>

450
00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.820
<i>Didn't you ask me to help you bring something back to the medical school?</i>

451
00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.050
<i>I'm on my way now.</i>

452
00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.690
I can't see it.

453
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:44.080
- Let me adjust it for you. 
 - Okay.

454
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:46.470
Can you see it now?

455
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.500
Yes, I can see a little bit.

456
00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:52.030
What are you two doing here?

457
00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.220
On a date?

458
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.140
- No wonder you were in such a hurry before. 
 - Hello, Professor.

459
00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.300
Hello, Professor. That's not it, Professor.

460
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.750
I'm here to return the skeleton.

461
00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:11.610
Then, were you aware that outsiders can't just casually enter the Forensic Science laboratory?

462
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.440
Yes, I do know. But I...

463
00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.520
But what?

464
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.760
Since you're not admitting that you're his family or girlfriend,

465
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.360
then I'll have to ask you to leave.

466
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.220
Fine, I'll leave.

467
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:26.250
All right. And in the future, don't come here anymore to find inspiration.

468
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:28.430
That won't do, Professor.

469
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:30.950
You haven't given me any feedback yet.

470
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.320
What feedback?

471
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.790
I sent a copy of all my drafts to you two days ago.

472
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.370
You haven't even responded to any.

473
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:38.380
And yet you said that you wanted to be my adviser.

474
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:39.890
I couldn't help it.

475
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:42.560
I've had so many classes lately that I don't have enough time to read through them.

476
00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.570
Professor, please hurry up and look at them.

477
00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:47.220
If I don't update soon, I'm going to lose all my readers.

478
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:51.850
Ever since you became my professional consultant, my novel has rarely been mocked by others.

479
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.340
Is that so?

480
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.220
How about this then?

481
00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.730
You guys keep chatting and I'll have a look at it now.

482
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:04.420
Professor. Professor?

483
00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:08.420
You need to take care of the new cadaver in a bit.

484
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.200
New cadaver? When does it get here?

485
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.110
It's on the way right now.

486
00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:16.660
Why didn't anyone notify me?

487
00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.480
What about my novel then, Professor?

488
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.920
Send it to me. I'll look at it for you.

489
00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:25.430
But I already made the deal with Professor, isn't that right?

490
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.470
Oh right! In the future, just send your drafts to Zhao Fanzhou.

491
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.420
He is the student I am most proud of.

492
00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:38.220
His professional capabilities are outstanding.

493
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.560
And most importantly, you two are similar in age and have common interests.

494
00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.700
Isn't that right? Unlike an old man like me.

495
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.060
All right then. I'll forward them to you now.

496
00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:57.070
Sorry, I think I forgot to bring my phone.

497
00:37:57.070 --> 00:37:58.430
Let me borrow yours.

498
00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.840
I'll transfer the files from my online storage folder.

499
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:03.620
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

500
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:09.260
Thank you.

501
00:38:16.290 --> 00:38:17.850
Zhou Xiao!

502
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:19.900
<i> Zhou Xiao!</i>

503
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.140
- <i>Zhou Xiao!</i> 
 - Cai Yasi?

504
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:24.520
Here.

505
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:35.170
I'm here.

506
00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.430
Why are you looking for me?

507
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:42.640
Did you return the items yet? I have something important to tell you.

508
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.970
What is it?

509
00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.720
There are other people here. Let's talk about it in private.

510
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:57.070
Let's go then. Professor, we'll be leaving first. Bye-bye.

511
00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.850
I have time right now to look at your novel,

512
00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.220
but I don't have time to send you the feedback.

513
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:06.030
Why don't you stay here and we can discuss it in person?

514
00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:12.700
That's right. If you don't update soon, you're going to lose all your readers.

515
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:15.190
How about I go find you later?

516
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.030
No. I really do have something important to tell you.

517
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.300
I'm sorry but I have to go with my friend.

518
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.430
How about I come and find you when you have time later?

519
00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.500
Hurry up!  What's with all this useless talk?

520
00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.080
It better be important, or my loss in readers will be blamed on you.

521
00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.380
<i> You only have ten readers, what can you lose? </i>

522
00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.450
<i> Who said that? I have at least fifty. </i>

523
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:45.690
It's okay. You tried your best.

524
00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:47.750
I also did my best.

525
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.790
The opponent is too strong.

526
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:54.040
Don't worry. We'll keep fighting.

527
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.190
Can you say it now?

528
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.360
Let's find a place and talk.

529
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.460
Did you get into trouble again?

530
00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:11.030
N-No. Let's go.

531
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.720
Why are you running so fast? Are you in a hurry to begin a new life?

532
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.000
It's so cold. I want to drink something hot.

533
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:25.180
What a coincidence. I'm feeling a little warm.

534
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.420
You think being warm is amazing? What are you trying to show off? Mentally dumb.

535
00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.420
Did you cause trouble again?

536
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:52.650
The last time you were in this condition was when you stayed overnight at the internet cafe,

537
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.840
you caught the place on fire when you lit up your mosquito-repellent incense in the middle of the night.

538
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:57.680
Is it more serious than last time?

539
00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:59.400
- I didn't cause trouble. 
 <i> - He set the internet cafe on fire? </i>

540
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:01.480
- Also, last time I only set two motherboards on fire. 
 <i> - Really? </i>

541
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.810
Why does it sound like I set the whole place on fire from your mouth?

542
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.980
Then, are you going to tell me or not?

543
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.610
Right, why didn't you pick up my call today?

544
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.070
I didn't bring my phone... Don't go off-topic.

545
00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.660
Say it.

546
00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:32.460
Look at you. You keep misplacing things.

547
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.590
Besides me, who else can endure you?

548
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.240
Say it again. Who's enduring who?

549
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.640
Don't be so short-tempered.

550
00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:44.840
Me. It's me. You're the one enduring me.

551
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.860
That's more like it.

552
00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.640
Actually, our tempers are both bad. Right?

553
00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.380
Have you ever thought that the both of us won't be able to find a significant other?

554
00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.920
Why? Did you confess and get rejected by someone?

555
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:11.820
No.

556
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:16.420
Fine, you didn't. Why are getting so agitated?

557
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.660
It's just... have you heard about the promise good friends make?

558
00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.700
What promise?

559
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:25.740
The one where in the future, if you're still single and I'm single,

560
00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:28.410
then let's be together.

561
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.720
I think I've heard this before.

562
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.560
But this promise is too unreasonable.

563
00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.290
Why?

564
00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.920
It's like using the "friend" label as a way to have a fallback.

565
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.350
Then why isn't it

566
00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:45.000
in the future, if we're both single, let's meet and kill ourselves.

567
00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.990
What's wrong?

568
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.530
You didn't become someone's fallback, did you?

569
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:54.990
You want me to think of a plan for you?

570
00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.890
No.

571
00:42:57.830 --> 00:42:59.970
Then, what's wrong? Are you going to say it or not? Hurry up and say it.

572
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.320
I want to go lay down in my dorm.

573
00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:07.360
I need to borrow money.

574
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.300
I'm asking you to lend me some money.

575
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:13.340
You talked so long just for this.

576
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.050
How much?

577
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.510
Two hundred and fifty.
<i>(T/N: The number 250 is usually used to call someone stupid/idiot)</i>

578
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.930
I only have a hundred. I'll transfer it to you when I get back to my dorm.

579
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.480
I'm leaving.

580
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.070
Next time, don't waste time.

581

<i>If Zhou Xiao really gets taken by someone else, all you have left is to cry.</i>

583
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.800
<i> Why is Zhou Xiao here? </i>

584
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.450
<i> Because I like her. </i>
