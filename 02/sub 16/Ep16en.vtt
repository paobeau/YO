<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.570
So, what did you want to say?

4
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.150
If you don't believe in turning a blind eye to the faults of the man you love,

5
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.470
please stop Jae Hyeon.

6
00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.260
You're the only person who can do so.

7
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.160
If you stop Jae Hyeon, I will leave.

8
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.870
Properly.

9
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.960
<i>Hyeong Seong</i>

10
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.370
I'm sorry,

11
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.880
but I will not stop him.

12
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.970
Alright, then. Continue your adulterous affair.

13
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.650
Forever.

14
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.630
However...

15
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.940
why does your justice bypass me and my father?

16
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.720
Is it okay to steal from people with money?

17
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.260
He will not steal.

18
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.110
If Sunbae has returned to his original self,

19
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.850
he will never steal from others.

20
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.760
I must seem laughable.

21
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.990
At the thought of losing money, I threw any feelings of love out the window.

22
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.460
I wouldn't have acted much differently, either.

23
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.880
My dad, mom, and younger sister.

24
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.490
If it was for my family, I could've done anything, too.

25
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.600
That's why I'm trying to do anything, too. Until the end.

26
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.920
I will need all of your support.

27
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.300
First,

28
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.370
you may be wondering what right I have to say such things.

29
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.330
<i> The owner's family, borrowed-name shares, Scissorhands,</i>

30
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.280
<i> and even my personal matters in the recent couple of months. </i>

31
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.190
<i>I know many cold glares were aimed at me. I know</i>

32
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.700
<i>I should be the one to deal with all these things myself.</i>

33
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.950
However, what I want to say today relates to your and my workplace.

34
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.350
It is about Hyeong Seong.

35
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.040
As you all know, next week, an extraordinary general shareholders' meeting will be held at Hyeong Seong Holdings.

36
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.750
That day,

37
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.910
I will need your support for a new Hyeong Seong.

38
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.730
Look here! Do you know how many people who were forcibly dismissed from Hyeong Seong

39
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.140
are now out on the streets? Before you come here talking about a new Hyeong Seong—

40
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.860
Five hundred forty-seven people.

41
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.210
One hundred thirty-seven from Hyeong Seong Mart, 292 from Hyeong Seong Steel,

42
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.200
35 from Hyeong Seong Products, and 83 from Hyeong Seong Steel Production.

43
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.230
<i>The other line's phone is off, you will be connected to voicemail...</i>

44
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.120
Please call Executive Director Hwang and Section Chief Lee.

45
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.390
<i>The other line's phone is off, you will be connected to voicemail...</i>

46
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.920
Lawyer Kim, as well.

47
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.180
It's Jang Seo Kyeong.

48
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.040
<i>Yes, CEO.</i>

49
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.110
How's my dad?

50
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.410
<i>The review for the legality of detention that we requested will open tomorrow.</i>

51
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.360
How does it look?

52
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.620
<i>Not good.</i>

53
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.280
The new Hyeong Seong will have ownership completely separated from management.

54
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.540
At the shareholders' meeting, I will request

55
00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.060
the dismissal of Chairman Jang San and CEO Jang Seo Kyeong.

56
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.100
Moreover, at the meeting,

57
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.950
I will resign.

58
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.870
<i>All affiliates of Hyeong Seong</i>

59
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.800
<i>will be changed to a system with a board of directors and management specialists.</i>

60
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.490
<i> They will be constantly observed by a compliance committee separated from their company. </i>

61
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.080
At the meeting, I plan on institutionalizing

62
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.230
all of this permanently.

63
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.660
For the sake of that new beginning,

64
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.590
I will need the support of the 8.97% of shares

65
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.240
that all of you possess.

66
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.400
Yeong Min, when did you learn how to play?

67
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.910
The dog at the village school will become literate in three years, after all (exposure to something for a long time will help you garner the knowledge).

68
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.010
But that woman before, was she Joon Seo's mom?

69
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.810
Yeah.

70
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.140
Did something happen?

71
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:11.280
Joon Seo's grandfather is in prosecution, that's why.

72
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.520
Yeong Min.

73
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.610
Hug me just once.

74
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.370
I'm all out.

75
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.430
Of what?

76
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.820
Love's battery. Recharge me.

77
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.920
Mom, that's a dad joke.

78
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.350
I'm not a dad.

79
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.480
<i>Vice President!</i>

80
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.690
What on earth is going on?

81
00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.560
You're giving up the management rights?

82
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.770
Let's sit down and talk.

83
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.460
The article was wrong, right?

84
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.120
No, it's just as you read.

85
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.530
How could you do this without discussing it even once?

86
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.650
I know you are against a new Hyeong Seong.

87
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.800
I didn't put that money in compliance management to do economic justice.

88
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.370
The two of you have choices as well.

89
00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:31.360
You could continue to help the new Hyeong Seong grow as their investors,

90
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.800
or sell all the stocks you've saved up to now when they're at their highest.

91
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.840
Why are you like this all of a sudden? You went through so much.

92
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.880
Now you're just barely getting your time to shine.

93
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.810
I used to think the same way as you both.

94
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:51.180
I wanted to rise to Chairman Jang San's position,

95
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.320
and I wanted to feel the power and comfort of life from that seat.

96
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.200
But someone asked me this.

97
00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.520
If I rise to that position,

98
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.830
will it be fair?

99
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.990
<i>Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to Give Up Management Rights for Hyeong Seong Group</i>

100
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.360
<i>Incoming Call: Unni Seon Hee</i>

101
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.830
Things went crazy after the bomb that Vice President Han Jae Hyeon dropped.

102
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:41.560
This timing perfectly crosses with Chairman Jang's indictment.

103
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.640
Isn't this Vice President Han Jae Hyeon's big picture?

104
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.780
I wondered how Jang San's faithful hunting dog, the Scissorhands who shed neither blood nor tears,

105
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.910
could become a whole new person overnight,

106
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.510
but I think I know the answer.

107
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.030
What's the answer?

108
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:07.330
The answer is Yoon Ji Soo.

109
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.030
I don't know what happened between the two of you,

110
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:18.680
but the Ji Soo I know can do more than just that.

111
00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:22.350
Unni.

112
00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.570
Do you want to have another cup of coffee? Or chicken and beer?

113
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.860
Hey you, with the broad shoulder.

114
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.500
Are you looking for something?

115
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.610
I'm sorry. I'm waiting for somebody.

116
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.610
Are you waiting for my daughter?

117
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.940
No, it's not your daughter.

118
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.650
But I'm right! You are the one who came together with our Ji soo!

119
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.610
Our Ji soo?

120
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.420
I want you to sit down first because my neck hurts.

121
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.460
Yes, ma'am.

122
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:15.560
What's your relationship with our Ji soo?

123
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.540
It's an "our Ji soo, our sunbae," relationship.

124
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:23.380
That's a serious relationship!

125
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.610
Sunbae.

126
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.990
Here you are!

127
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.520
Ji Soo.

128
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.740
That grandmother is really nice.

129
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.780
I asked her to be my mom, but she said she can't.

130
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.420
She called you as her daughter?

131
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.590
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

132
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.090
As if anyone would doubt she is a Gyeongsang Province's grandmother.

133
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:54.440
Do you know why I was waiting for you here?

134
00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.350
I know what happened today.

135
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.010
What happened today started here.

136
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.550
"There are still people there."

137
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.870
Are you not going to compliment me?

138
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.430
Come closer.

139
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.390
I heard this is a compliment?

140
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.930
Come out here. Come out here.

141
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.520
Did you hear about Vice-President Han Jae Hyeon giving up the management rights?

142
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.520
What do you expect for the review of the legality of your detention?

143
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.930
Is your tax evasion and embezzlement of public funds true? Please say a word!

144
00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.990
Say something about it!

145
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.650
<i> The habeas corpus request by the chairman Jang San of Hyeong Seong Group on the first day of the prosecution </i>

<i> was rejected by the court today. </i>

147

 - Is that Joon Seo's grandfather?

<i> and might try to destroy the evidence, </i>

149
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.970
<i>- thus stating the violation is significant enough to maintain the detention. </i> 
 - Yes.

150
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:12.850
It would be hard for Joon Seo.

<i> Employee stockholders association and minority shareholders </i>

162
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.910
<i> supported Vice-President Han's side. </i>

163
00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.320
<i> Court </i>

164
00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.270
Throughout the trial process so far,

165
00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.630
it has been clearly confirmed that the claim from the three defendants, Jang San, Hwang Hak Soo, and Lee Myeong Geun,

166
00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.920
is explicitly against the objective evidence.

167
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.260
The defendants have a long history of corruption crimes involving chaebol corruption

168
00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:33.140
together with political and business collusion.

169
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:36.610
In the same manner, for the benefit of  the company's expedient management and the personal interests of the owner's family,

170
00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.920
they have repeatedly committed systematic illegal acts that go against the national judicial order

171
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.070
for decades until now.

172
00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.190
In addition to this case, there are no less than forty-two additional cases of criminal facts

173
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:53.510
for which the statute of limitations has already passed and which are therefore not covered in this trial.

174
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.140
One of them is

175
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:03.940
a crime resulting in the death of two workers who killed themselves

176
00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:08.390
because they could not stand the stigma of being "agents at the company's service," union-breakers, and receiving bribes,

177
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.960
which is an anti-labor, anti-human rights crime.

178
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.890
And yet, the defendants

179
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.120
denied all the crimes and continued to make excuses  throughout the trial,

180
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:27.100
and even made false statements and criticized this trial.

181
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:31.340
By showing such an attitude, they once again caused great pain to the people

182
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.590
who observed this investigation and the present affair.

183
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.940
Your Honor,

184
00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.540
please take this case as a valuable opportunity to put right our justice and principle of law,

185
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:51.000
and to set an example to support the efforts of the majority of law-abiding entrepreneurs.

186
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.060
For defendants Jang San, Hwang Hak Soo, and Lee Myeong Geun's crimes,

187
00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:01.910
please give a fair evaluation and severe punishment.

188
00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.940
We should be drinking on days like today

189
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:23.740
for completely opposite reasons.

190
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.940
Besides the fact that you are not managing the company,

191
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.100
nothing will be different for you.

192
00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.730
The largest shareholders are still you and the chairman.

193
00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:41.750
My entire shares will be applied to the nonprofit foundation that I'm going to create.

194
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:48.250
I'll make the articles of association so that nobody can challenge your ownership under any circumstances.

195
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:57.690
If Hyeong Seong keeps moving forward in a righteous manner, it can be much better than it is now.

196
00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:23.660
I'm not giving you this because I got touched by what you said. 
 <i>Confirmation of Consensual Intention of Divorce</i>

197
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:31.160
I met Yoon Ji Soo before you went to see the employees.

198
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.920
I still don't know that much about you,

199
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.770
but she had faith in you.

200
00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:47.160
And at my dad's first trial today,

201
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.150
I had a lot of thoughts on my mind.

202
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.720
I was thinking about you and your father as well.

203
00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:02.750
It's a given, but I'm going to take Joon Seo with me.

204
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.390
Joon Seo also said he wanted that, too.

205
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.090
I'm going to continuously talk with him as well.

206
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.650
Let me ask you one last question.

207
00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.850
Why did you marry me?

208
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.250
Because I was threatening you with killing myself?

209
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.630
Or because you felt bad for me?

210
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.830
Not just because I felt bad for you.

211
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.350
I had lost my love and beliefs

212
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:46.280
and lived my life as if I pushed myself into hell and shouldn't be happy,

213
00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.030
but you gave me comfort.

214
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:57.080
I could have some laughter.

215
00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:04.680
I thought I could love you if I tried.

216
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.140
I felt the same as well.

217
00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.620
I thought if I tried a little bit,

218
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:15.270
then you would soon be all mine like any other guy.

219
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:20.960
But after all, it's because you were different from those other guys,

220
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.550
that I said we should get married.

221
00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:30.730
I want you to be happy.

222
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.310
Don't worry. Of course, I will be.

223
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.490
Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

224
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.910
You can go home.

225
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.390
I'm sorry I inconvenienced you to come all the way here today.

226
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.790
I'm sorry?

227
00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:42.480
The suspect, Kwon Pil Ho, withdrew his statement.

228
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.610
What are you talking about?

229
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.480
He had stated that the reason he committed the crime was because of your advice

230
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.650
and that you were the one who told him about Han Jae Hyeon's whereabouts on the day of the crime.

231
00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:01.630
But now he changed his statement, saying that it was all done by himself.

232
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.840
It is hard to find other evidence for this kind of case,

233
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.460
so the statement of the one involved in the case takes priority.

234
00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.760
You know that as well, right, Lawyer?

235
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:18.180
Do you have anything to state differently from him about this case?

236
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:25.880
Of course, we don't close the case just with the victim's statement.

237
00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.520
There was a report about you,

238
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:31.510
and we already figured out the circumstances of the case.

239
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:36.840
But even so, we are going to end this case here.

240
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.700
There's one big reason.

241
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:47.260
The victim, Han Jae Hyeon, filed a petition seeking leniency for Kwon Pil Ho.

242
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.520
In my life as a detective,

243
00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:55.510
I never saw a victim filing such a long petition for leniency toward the assailant.

244
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.100
And I didn't even ask,

245
00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.350
but he said multiple times you are not related to this case at all.

246
00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:09.360
As for us, we can figure out what the truth is

247
00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:13.010
by just looking and hearing from all of you.

248
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.640
But we decided to respect the will of the two persons involved.

249
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.540
As you know, the law also has eyes to see.

250
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.480
Let's end it here.

251
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.600
My apologies for inconveniencing you today.

252
00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.450
I couldn't forgive you.

253
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.450
If he had lost his life on that day,

254
00:22:54.450 --> 00:23:00.130
then you would've taken away two people's lives, Sunbae's and the Elder's.

255
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.900
Also, you would've left an unforgettable scar in Yeong Min's heart as well.

256
00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.710
I thought, since he's alive maybe I should let it go.

257
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.640
Leaving everyone unaware, keeping it unknown to the world,

258
00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:20.260
and just covering it up myself. I agonized over wether that would just do.

259
00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.680
But I couldn't do that.

260
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.230
Because you are Yeong Min's father.

261
00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.320
Because he's going to keep seeing you in the future.

262
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.540
Thinking of you not paying for your misdeed

263
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.500
and continuing to see Yeong Min without feeling any remorse or regret,

264
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.350
that made me scared.

265
00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:56.460
I know how you came out of the police station today.

266
00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:00.350
I also know he claimed your innocence.

267
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.460
There's only one thing I want from you.

268
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.540
The fact that you're the father of our son can't be changed,

269
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.100
so I want you to change.

270
00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:19.300
I think you can change yourself.

271
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.680
When I said you look like you're standing at the edge of the cliff,

272
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.050
so I said I wanted to hold you to not fall,

273
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.790
when I said those words, you were a good person.

274
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.860
If you come back to the person you were at that time,

275
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:50.670
I'll think about forgiving you.

276
00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:21.890
Yeong Min!

277
00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:29.990
So today is the day you are coming.

278
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.420
Yes.

279
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.640
Is something wrong?

280
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.690
I'm sorry, Yeong Min.

281
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.380
Because I'm such a bad father.

282
00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:51.190
When you said you wanted to live with Dad, it was not what you really wanted, right?

283
00:25:56.190 --> 00:26:01.050
But I also lost some confidence.

284
00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.600
Why?

285
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:08.880
Do you know that you are becoming more like your mom?

286
00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:18.100
I think having one person like your mom in my life is enough.

287
00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.610
You mean it was a bad experience?

288
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:28.690
I meant it was good. So much that I couldn't let her go that easily.

289
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:32.520
Then why did you break up with Mom?

290
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.160
I didn't have confidence.

291
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:41.510
I wanted to know if she liked me or not,

292
00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.170
so I did a lot of twisted and bad things to her.

293
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.520
So stay next to your mom, Yeong Min.

294
00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.680
With you, she can have some laughter.

295
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:08.770
Would you keep meeting me, too?

296
00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:13.800
I'll be a dad that you'll never be ashamed of.

297
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:18.650
Yes.

298
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.830
<i> I'll wait here until you come out, Joon Seo.</i>

299
00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:58.930
<i> The person you are trying to reach is not available... </i>

300
00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.370
Is it not fun?

301
00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:44.820
No.

302
00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.210
Should we have gone to a different place?

303
00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.270
Should we go camping instead?

304
00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:53.300
It's fine.

305
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.590
Joon Seo.

306
00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.500
You hate me, right?

307
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.280
Yes.

308
00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.280
It's good that you're honest.

309
00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:13.390
But I can kind of understand you.

310
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.010
I know you had a hard time.

311
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:24.100
Grandfather has been always yelling at you, and you don't go along with Mom.

312
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.210
Joon Seo.

313
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.580
I'm always going to be your dad, wherever you are,

314
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.260
and I'll always be on your side.

315
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:41.210
You should protect your mom.

316
00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.380
And I hope you can tell me anything,

317
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.030
be it a good or a bad thing.

318
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.760
I'm going to come see you every week.

319
00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.710
But listen, Joon Seo.  You shouldn't do anything bad. Okay?

320
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:04.580
I said I'll be on your side no matter what,

321
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:11.330
so if you do a bad thing, then I have to go to prison again.

322
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:20.890
Let's do these things more often, go fishing, go camping, play basketball...

323
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.500
Let's forget about fishing.

324
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.540
You find it that boring?

325
00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:31.470
I love you, Joon Seo.

326
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.900
I love you, too.

327
00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.790
To Yeong Woo's bar?

328
00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.200
<i> That's right. </i>

329
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.470
Why all of a sudden?

330
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:52.570
Dong Jin said he got some bonus, and called everyone to gather.

331
00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.230
Okay, I'll be there.

332
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.300
That's great. I'll see you soon.

333
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.940
Hey.

334
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.280
<i> June, 1994 </i>

335
00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.180
What should I do for a birthday?

336
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.710
My birthday is still far away?

337
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.240
Not for your birthday.

338
00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.000
Ji Soo's?

339
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.080
Go to a buffet.

340
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.030
Isn't it expensive?

341
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.720
You don't even have ₩1,500 <i>($1.50)</i>?

342
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.790
Is there a buffet that only cost ₩1,500?

343
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.760
The school's cafeteria.

344
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.160
If you want to eat something luxurious like western style food,

345
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.580
then go to the language institute to eat the pork cutlet.

346
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.530
You crazy...

347
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.250
I don't know either! I never had any experience.

348
00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:46.240
I'm sorry, sorry. My apologies.

349
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.550
So when's her birthday?

350
00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:49.800
The 29th.

351
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.150
- It's coming up soon, then? 
 - Yes.

352
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.480
If you don't have any money, just make do with telling her something sweet.

353
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.330
Or sing a song for her.

354
00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.820
I'll teach you a song.

355
00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:05.170
Are you going to sing that again? ♫ Your silence... ♫

356
00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.650
Be quiet!

357
00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.740
♫ When the stormy ocean ♫

358
00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.170
♫ calms down ♫

359
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.090
- ♫ will you come today ♫ 
 - You're losing the tempo.

360
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.290
♫ from the other side of the ocean  ♫ 
 <i>("Yeonga", adapted from the Maori song "Pokarekare Ana" introduced to South Korea during the Korean war) </i>

361
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.190
But you don't know any other chords besides the C chord?

362
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.980
- Forget about it. 
 - You should practice more.

363
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.020
Just forget about it.

364
00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.520
Enjoy your food.

365
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:43.020
Let's eat while it's hot.

366
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.220
Why did you bring me to such an expensive place?

367
00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:47.190
I like the school's cafeteria.

368
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:49.420
I have a lot of money!

369
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:54.150
If you don't eat, then I'm going to eat all of it.

370
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.000
How is it?

371
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.900
It's very delicious.

372
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:47.100
This is why everybody gets excited about their birthdays.

373
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.180
Have some more.

374
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.660
Don't cry, it's really nothing.

375
00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:12.280
I'll give you a much better one in the future.

376
00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.240
I mean...

377
00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.100
I don't need a present.

378
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.670
You are the present. Why would you give me another one?

379
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.420
Take it.

380
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.160
Thank you.

381
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.010
I really didn't imagine something like this.

382
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.320
I'm not sure if I can take this.

383
00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:41.970
If I have to give a present worth as much as you,

384
00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.260
then I need to have billions of won (millions of dollars).

385
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.540
When did you have time to record this?

386
00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.860
You said you like to listen to me singing.

387
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.170
Of course, I do.

388
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.320
Can I listen to this now?

389
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.300
Right now?

390
00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.830
Then I'll go to the bathroom for a bit.

391
00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:28.620
You can listen to it.

Let's blow out the candles now.

I'm going to blow now.

405

Oh, the wish! I forgot to make a wish.

Are you okay?

Hey!

418

Happy birthday, Yoon Ji Soo. It's the first time I'm saying this to you since 1994.

419
00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.860
Happy birthday, Yoon Ji Soo.

420
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.480
Should we sing another song for you?

421
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.780
Come here.

422
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:45.390
You should blow out the candles and make a wish.

423
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.970
I can't.

424
00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:01.550
I don't have a birthday.

425
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:05.930
Ji Soo. Since your birthday is their death anniversary,

426
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:10.770
you will remember even more and won't be able to forget for even longer.

427
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:16.230
So maybe your mother and Ji Yeong would be even more grateful to you for this.

428
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.050
The candles are going to melt away. Blow them out now.

429
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:30.560
You should eat a lot of cake, too. For all the cakes you haven't had all these years.

430
00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.210
Also, get your 20-years-worth of birthday presents from Jae Hyeon!

431
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.760
If you don't blow out the candles fast, then I'm going to have a hard time again because of the vice-president.

432
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.710
Why because of me?

433
00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.950
Happy birthday.

434
00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.220
How did you find that photo?

435
00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.960
I asked Yeong Min to help me.

436
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:35.150
It was all film back in the day.

437
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.550
So I asked Yeong Min to look for the film.

438
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.620
What if my dad had thrown that out?

439
00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.000
Then I was going to photoshop it.

440
00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:46.870
Ji Soo.

441
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:53.690
You can't just cut off the finger because it's painful.

442
00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.850
Actually, you should take care of it more often and with more consideration.

443
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.390
If I see this every day,

444
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.320
will I meet my mom and Ji Yeong someday?

445
00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.640
Of course, you will.

446
00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.960
You are going to sleep in every day, our Ji Soo.

447

<i>Do what you want to do.</i>

449
00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.840
<i>- Come home early! Your dad's going to be angry if you come home late. 
 - Yes!</i>

450
00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:04.030
<i>Look at her, leaving without looking back at us.</i>

<i>We are going to forget your face, Unni!</i>

When did you write this?

467
00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.270
When we were here before.

468
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:25.010
- I want to write something, too. Can you give me a pen? 
 - Do you want to?

469
00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.020
It doesn't have a subject.

470
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.020
Is that so?

471
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.540
There are still tons of stars.

472
00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.800
They were all staying at the same spot without going anywhere.

473
00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.870
Admirably.

474
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.660
It's sparkling and unbelievably cute.

475
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.990
Like our Ji Soo.

476
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.550
It was hard to keep your spot, right?

477
00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:23.880
It would not have been easy.

478
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:27.990
A little bit. It did make my legs go numb.

479
00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.380
Do you remember what I said here before?

480
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.900
Of course, I remember. Even in order.

481
00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.090
What did I say?

482
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:43.260
"Because I'm sorry."

483
00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:46.870
"Because I love you."

484
00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:48.830
Besides that.

485
00:45:50.530 --> 00:45:53.170
But that was the highlight?

486
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:12.160
♫ <i>Perhaps, someday we will remember</i> ♫

487

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.160
The painful finger.

489
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.980
Is not painful anymore.

490
00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:39.170
Now it's just my finger.

Bring back the patriotic martyr of democracy!

502
00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.140
Is this really going to work?

505
00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:07.340
They went that way!

506
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.340
Are you okay?

507
00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:17.240
I'm sorry. I just wanted to help you.

508
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.830
It's because of the tear gas...

509
00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.010
They went that way. So you should go this way.

<i> Yoon Ji Soo </i>

511
00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.290
And take this with you.

512
00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:46.310
I heard if you put this under your eyes,  then you'll be okay when you get hit by the tear gas.

513
00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:48.740
Ah, that is...

514
00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.620
Now you laughed.

515
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:09.580
<i> That baby-like college guy who was good-looking even just with his eyes showing, that was you? </i>

516
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.560
I went back to that street a few times after then, but I couldn't find you, Yoon Ji Soo.

517
00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.570
But why didn't you tell me about that?

518
00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.480
Because I was embarrassed?

519
00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.200
As soon as I got into university, every day was a rally, and every day was terrifying.

520
00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:32.230
That was the first day of street demonstration, so it was extra terrifying to me.

521
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.620
Then were you crying because you were terrified?

522
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:38.390
No, it was because of the tear gas stinging my eyes.

523
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.810
Then you liked me first?

524
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.530
- That's not true. 
 - As if.

525
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.380
I was just being curious about this eccentric and funny girl.

526
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:50.010
It wasn't like I liked you.

527
00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.820
What are you talking about? I was really pretty!

528
00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:55.170
Yes, you were pretty.

529
00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.360
What about me?

530
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:02.330
When you were the freshman or when I was the freshman?

531
00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.140
Well, both of them.

532
00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:10.930
When you were the freshman, that college guy whose eyes were the only thing I saw,

533
00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:13.550
I felt bad for him but he was very cute.

534
00:50:13.550 --> 00:50:16.040
And when I was the freshman, you were

535
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:19.310
trying to pretend to be a strong person and that was cute, too.

536
00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.350
I forgot your ID was 'Noir' before.

<i> Us Together Foundation </i>

543
00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:25.740
Next Monday, we have to check the after school garden of Gyerim Elementary School in Soomin-dong.

544
00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.190
And from Tuesday to Thursday we have the middle school English speech classes in Duwul-li, North Chungcheong.

545
00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:34.170
Also, on Friday we come back to Seoul and... one second, please.

546
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:37.190
There's the fifth class for The Exciting Country of Coding in Dongseon-dong Community Service Center.

547
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:39.320
I was about to talk about that class.

548
00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.340
To make the kids learn the coding with more fun, I think we need something to move according to their coding,

549
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.960
like a wooden robot or something like that.

550
00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:49.480
I agree with you. If there's something like what you just said, Mr. 'Love letter,'

551
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.650
then it can show what coding does in real life,

552
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.290
and it makes it easier to explain it to kids.

553
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:57.350
I like the reaction from you, 'Candy.'

554
00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.680
So speaking of that.

555
00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:02.760
It doesn't feel good...

556
00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:06.990
Why don't you become the wooden robot, 'Running Man'?

557
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.840
Vice-president! I mean, 'Love letter.'

558
00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:12.110
There are 'Candy,' 'Anne of Green Gables,' and 'John Snow' here.

559
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:14.070
Why do I have to be the robot?

560
00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:16.060
I got old, so my body doesn't work like it used to.

561
00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:18.880
What do you mean by old?

562
00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.570
Thank you in advance.

563
00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.110
Yes, I will.

564
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:28.460
Really, my body reacts first to this 'Thank you' code from you, 'Love letter.'

565
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:36.670
Many people misunderstand when they hear 'music psychotherapy.'

566
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.010
For example, they might think it is a sort of treatment for patients with autism,

567
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:44.710
to whom you would play a certain piece by Mozart that would make them get better.

568
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:48.370
But now you understood it's not something like that, right?

569
00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:51.130
- I think you are really amazing. 
 - What about it?

570
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:55.410
That you finished the Bachelor's degree in such a short time and came into the Master's program like this.

571
00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:57.960
I really wanted to come to this place, so I did my best.

572
00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.720
And there's another amazing thing about you.

573
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.220
- What else? 
 - That you are really popular!

574
00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:06.090
Everybody's going crazy that you are one of the three beauties in this school!

575
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:07.880
Nobody can imagine your actual age.

576
00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.810
Who are the other two? Let me see their faces.

577
00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.450
Should I call them to come out quietly to the back of the general-hall?

578
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.860
Will you?

579
00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.990
We put it together perfectly so there won't be anything that side could refute at all. 
 <i>Court of Law</i>

580
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.240
Also, we made the division of property very clearly as well,

581
00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.440
so they would lose their money and lose their minds.

582
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.980
Can you be quiet?

583
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:28.090
Yes, I'm sorry.

584
00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:30.680
- Have a safe trip back home! 
 - Safe trip!

585
00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.560
Don't give up on the child support money.

586
00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:39.370
Whether they have money or not, wether that money is clean or dirty doesn't matter. It's your right as the custody holder.

587
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.020
Thank you so much.

588
00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:46.020
I don't know what to say. You even did the divorce suit for free.

589
00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:50.410
I have committed too many misdeeds to get that thank you from you.

590
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:55.940
That's Lawyer Lee Se Hoon.

591
00:53:55.940 --> 00:54:00.910
I heard he gave up on his successful law firm and started to do divorce lawsuits for free.

592
00:54:00.910 --> 00:54:06.790
What is this feeling?  Why do I feel like I lost to him or something like that?

593
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:11.670
How are you? I'm good.

594
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:17.100
I'm walking with Mond and Kaw in the Han River area.

595
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:21.310
Is that so? They were very cute. Show them to me next time.

596
00:54:21.310 --> 00:54:25.190
You don't have to worry about my babies, I'll raise them as I see fit.

597
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:27.930
You have so much work to do. That's right—

598
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.890
Oh, no! I'm so sorry.

599
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:33.320
- What should we do? 
 - I'm okay.

600
00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:37.300
That doesn't look okay. I'll compensate you for it.

601
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:42.130
If I hold them like this, it's not visible. So don't worry about it.

602
00:54:42.130 --> 00:54:43.860
Let's go.

603
00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:49.140
I can hold one of them. They look heavy for you.

604
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.540
I'm fine.

605
00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:53.360
You only have the stain on one side...

606
00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.530
I said, I'm fine.

607
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.790
I don't think you're fine. The puppy looks uncomfortable, too.

608
00:54:57.790 --> 00:54:59.980
You're making me uncomfortable.

609
00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.630
Then!

610
00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.690
Where do you live?

611
00:55:05.690 --> 00:55:07.050
I'm sorry?

612
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:09.470
I'll drive you to your place.

613
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.990
Why?

614
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:12.960
Because you can't use your hands anymore.

615
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.730
I also have a car.

616
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.720
Then! Can I have your number?

617
00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.790
Unni is finally leaving to put on tons of oil on my body.

618
00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:39.620
That sounds nice. I want to go with you.

619
00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:43.900
You are too busy. With the school, the after-school classes, and all those requests for private lessons.

620
00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:48.050
Send me many photos, then! So I can feel the vacation as well.

621
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:53.060
We'll see! I don't know if I'll have time to take photos!

622
00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.850
Me and Joon Seo came into Korea because it's summer vacation.

623
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:00.660
I have no intention to meet anybody, though?

624
00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:05.570
I'm busy and I also have a boyfriend.

625
00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:10.060
Who is very handsome and only has eyes for me.

626

631
00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:55.380
I found you, Yoon Ji Soo.

632
00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.860
Do you feel a bit more comfortable now?

633
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.410
Because we met each other again.

634
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:21.040
We've endured it well, right?

635
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.700
I told you so.

636
00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:35.620
We can endure it, by holding onto the times that were beautiful like flowers.

637
00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.360
And I knew we would meet each other again.

638
00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:50.820
Thank you.

639
00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:53.770
You recognized me, even though I changed over time.

640
00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.620
I would've recognized you no matter how you had changed.

641
00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.560
Because I was always looking only at you the whole time.

642
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:19.930
I wanted to hug you like this.

643
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.630
You did great, Ji Soo.

644
00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:36.330
You did more than amazing.

645
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:46.730
I won't forget those times. Because that was the most beautiful time in my life, when my love bloomed.

646
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:49.860
And you two were the flowers.

647
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.800
It's still the most beautiful time in our lives now.

648
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:56.190
Because we are together.

649
00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:13.340
By the way, Ji Soo.

650
00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:16.960
I thought we would get a sad ending,  but doesn't it seem to be a happy ending?

651
00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:20.060
It's a totally happy ending.

652
00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:24.340
I'm so happy that I can't stop smiling.
