WEBVTT

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760
Love Is All

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.060
Tan Lingyin looks into the case of Qi Hui;
Tang Tianyuan finds out the identity of Miaomiaosheng.
Episode 04

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.820
Is your honor here?

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.530
You're back, Adviser.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.320
Magistrate Tang?

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.470
He's on a private visit.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.030
A private visit? Why he didn't take me with him?

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.830
He said

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.590
don't tell anyone that he went to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.970
Mount Tianmu with Cong Shun.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.030
Mount Tianmu?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.120
He also said that

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.080
he will go Western Street

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.880
to avoid to meet you.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.600
Why did he avoid me?

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.240
Sir, please give me two of this.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.520
Okay. Here you are.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.470
Have a look.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:40.240
Thanks.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.750
Why you are here?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.240
As your adviser, I should accompany with you,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240
my lord.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.830
As a female adviser,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.270
it's not appropriate to walk on the street.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.120
Still talking about this?

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.480
I'm an adviser already.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.390
Stop.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.230
Stay away from me.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.020
Don't make any trouble for me.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.960
An adviser should be a good partner with her county magistrate.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.550
I'll go with you today.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.910
It's Magistrate Tang. Really?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.030
Exactly!

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.960
So charming!

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.110
Magistrate Tang.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.920
It seems like you are more popular

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.080
than a female adviser.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.430
It's all because of Miaomiaosheng.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.030
Now people wanna know what

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.520
Tang Feilong looks like after reading the novel.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.600
Mr. Miao is a good novelist.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.030
It must be amazing to be the center.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.960
Its fine.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.360
Where's Mr. Miao exactly?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.550
Died outside?

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.720
Mr. Miao will not come back in one or two years.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.270
He's awesome.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.600
Even he does not have super power,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.160
he can know what happened

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.520
in Tongling.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.630
Did your new book sell well?

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.750
Thanks to you, my lord.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.360
Oh,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.390
I have an idea to

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.330
help you not be recognized by others.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.960
Assistant Zhou, what are you doing here?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.740
Just look around.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:10.960
Then it's so lucky of you.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.910
See, my sword.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:12.750
I've just got it today.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.750
Let me show you my sword skills. Let's go.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.640
My lord.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.390
What is it?

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.800
A piece of mustache. How's it?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.160
So ugly!

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.270
You know nothing. It's called "private visit".

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.640
You have a pretty face.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.770
How can you just go around without any disguise!

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.350
Disguise cannot cover my good looking.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.350
Although Tongling is a small town,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.110
people said there's rich mineral in Mount Tianmu.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.410
Is there any chance to pick up some gold?

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.600
You are such avaricious in young age.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.530
So what? Plus,

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.640
I take it in my own way,

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.820
instead of robbing it from others.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.700
Really?

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.340
Yep. I'm an honest person.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.240
My lord, adviser, you two go slowly.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.840
I'll go first to explore the way.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.000
Do you have water? I wanna drink.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:13.690
I wanna drink water.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.600
It is not appropriate.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.770
You wanna share the same bottle water with me?

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.950
A little dirt never killed anybody.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.320
You mean I'm not clean?

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.230
Or I carry a virus?

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.330
Nope.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:26.950
I'm thirsty. I wanna drink water.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.550
I know her.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.750
You met here before?

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.390
She came to our bookstore several days before.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.670
My lord! Adviser! Are you okay?

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.600
We're fine. Inform County Officers

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.780
that we found a female body here.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.110
Tell them come here right now.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.960
What's her name?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.140
Qi Hui.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.480
She bought books from our bookstore several days ago.

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.230
You mean Qi's Family who's running a boat business.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.390
She's born in a rich family.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.920
But why she's wearing shabby clothes?

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.270
Scared?

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.880
No.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.730
If you are not scared,

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.720
go and check the dead body.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.200
What? Why me!

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.200
Why you don't do it?

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.110
I'm a man. It's not appropriate.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.880
Gold?

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.110
Check her fatal injury.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.000
It's on her neck.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.630
What about her nail?

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.940
There's really something in her nail.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.270
She was fought with someone.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.930
I quite!

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.440
My hand can only use for writing,

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.200
not using a weapon.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.350
Please let me go.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.040
Brother Zhou, your Kungfu is not good enough.

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.390
What if someone wanna kill you!

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.480
You can't even protect yourself.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.040
A hero can sacrifice his own life when facing his enemy.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.000
Don't think I don't know

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.350
what you mean.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.230
The White Horse tells a story

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:36.670
of a ranger armed with swords

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.050
to protect his country with no fear.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.600
By considering your Kungfu, you still have long way to go.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.160
Bad news, Officer Zheng!

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.300
Your honor found a female body.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.240
So he asked you to help there.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.160
Excited. I'll go now.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.510
Assistant, wait for me. See you later.

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.920
Go.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.880
I buggered up my ankle.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:04.970
Are you able to walk?

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.330
No way. It's so hurt.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.690
Come on up.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.040
Aren't you a neat freak?

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.440
Don't think too much.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.110
If you die here,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.860
our County Office will take the responsibility.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.820
Then I'm coming.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.760
Wash my clothes five times later.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.230
Understand?

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.960
I'll do whatever you said.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.370
My lord!

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.810
My lord!

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.710
why do you come so late?

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:40.629
Where's Zheng Shaofeng?

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.440
He said he would like to train

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.660
the most savage horse by himself.

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:45.220
Now he's doing it down the hill.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.210
Idiot!

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.370
Hurry up to deal with the case!

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:53.560
What are you laughing at?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.440
Go!

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.350
Go.

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.840
How's everything? Have you found anything?

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.230
She's wearing shabby clothes,

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.470
but her bag is full of gold.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.150
Can she be a thief?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.230
She doesn't look like that.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.180
But

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.670
the gold is not pure.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.030
It seems it hasn't been refined.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.400
Just like those from the mine site.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.420
Gold mine?

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:35.910
Brother Zhou.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.200
Have you ever heard Tongling County is

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.880
abound in gold and jewel?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.080
I've heard about it before.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.040
Now, it looks like Tongling is really a treasure place.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.550
Brother Zhou. Do you have anything else?

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:08.880
Our lord was just on board,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.010
and there comes a murder.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.970
Tongling County is a quite danger place.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:16.810
See?

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.420
Those decorative patterns is sewed by Madam for our lord.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.230
Now it's stained with mud. How can we wash it?

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.780
Muskmelon, I think it's not all adviser's fault.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.960
The weather changes a lot.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.640
We'd better think about

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.350
how to wash it as soon as possible.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.450
Adviser is smart. How about we ask her?

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.960
No way.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.640
She's a troublemaker.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.640
She only brings troubles

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.630
to my lord and implicates us.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.590
Adviser.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.910
Don't you know it's rude to

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.710
eavesdrop on others?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.000
The volume of your voice. Everyone can hear you

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.440
from 10 miles away.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.200
Adviser, talking about the volume,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.880
no one can compare

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.150
with you.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520
Stop.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.260
What are you doing here?

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.910
Doing my job. What else can I do?

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.740
Not for seducing my lord?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.350
Muskmelon. Muskmelon.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:19.550
Muskmelon, don't worry.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.840
Even if I have a target in County Office,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.670
it won't be your lord.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.080
I've already in love with someone.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.440
Really? Who's it, Adviser?

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.600
You two also came from the Capital.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.490
Have you ever heard about Tang Tianyuan?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.750
He's my love.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.440
I have no interest in your lord.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.670
Don't worry.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.520
Oh, Pyrus, where's my lord?

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.230
My lord.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.440
He went to the mortuary.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.000
Cong Shun,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.990
it's so dark here.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.150
Bring more lights here.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.400
Okay. Got it.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.110
What a monster! Even interested in dead body!

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.620
Go to the hell!

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.470
What are you doing?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:39.550
My lord. What are you doing here?

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.350
How do you have such special hobby?

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.050
What hobby?

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.720
Eye to eye. Nose to nose.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:51.760
What kind of hobby can it be?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.030
Can't you be professional?

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.150
I'm doing an autopsy.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:55.840
Really?

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.680
What else can it be?

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.350
Who knows? Sichuan pepper, white onion and vinegar?

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.710
You call it an autopsy?

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.180
You think I'm gonna cook?

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.520
If the body put in here for a long time,

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.960
some wounds may not be appeared.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.660
Put some white onion on the wound

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.440
and apply some paper with vinegar

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.190
so that those wounds will be appeared.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.070
Really?!

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:19.960
Since you are here,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.280
lock the door and take notes.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.070
You'd better not be a pervert.

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.280
My lord, is it necessary to be so close to the body?

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.540
There's some blood on her hair.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.300
It may be missed if we don't check it closely.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.790
That means

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.230
she died by a hit on her hindbrain.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.020
That's so cruel. Pinch and beat.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.490
You said you saw her before?

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:57.790
Yep. I saw her twice before.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.990
She worn gorgeously accompanied by a maid.

00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:03.030
Oh, a man once came to her.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:03.850
What kind of man?

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.940
I don't know.

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.550
But she brought gold

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.860
and buy some books from my bookstore.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.090
And there's a wound on her lip. Make a record.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.210
She must bite it herself.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.710
By herself?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.230
Let me see you bitten yourself.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:23.760
The lower lip.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:27.520
Why others bite lower lip

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.960
looks so piteous?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.200
But you look

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.200
so fierce.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.640
I'm not the lady of a rich family.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.590
How can I be piteous!

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.110
Why this

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.150
My lord?

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.180
My lord?

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.640
He must be back.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.470
Tan Lingyin. What are you doing?

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.790
Get out right now.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.670
Leave me alone

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.910
whenever I do an autopsy.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:55.230
Go away.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.520
Go. Go. Go.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.200
Okay. Okay.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.080
My lord, I don't wanna stay here either.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:17.520
The door.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.750
Cong Shun!

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:25.070
I see.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.700
What are you doing?

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:29.790
Climb over the wall.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:31.820
That's so dangerous.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:32.840
I can't catch it.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:36.790
Are you okay?

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.960
I twisted my ankle.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.230
Let me check.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.520
Can you stand up?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:53.600
What are you doing?

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.690
May I hug you?

00:17:01.150 --> 00:17:01.910
You already did.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.470
Go.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:16.440
Thanks.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.470
Female is not fit to work in a County Office.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.280
It's not hurt anymore.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:24.190
Work so hard?

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:26.640
Don't you think

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.680
it is better to be a housewife

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:29.470
in a happy family?

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.470
Why you have to work in County Office?

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:34.430
Most of girls' marriage

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:36.760
depends on their parents and the matchmaker.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.070
Some of them don't even know

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.750
what her husband looks like before married him.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:42.920
Don't even say love him or not.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.280
If you married someone who you don't love,

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:48.760
how will you live in a happy life?

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.960
Then, what is called happy life?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.350
Get married with someone you loved.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:59.880
So you ran away from home and came to Tongling.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.800
That's all for

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.110
pursuing true love?

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.830
You think too much.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.070
I am the person

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:07.430
who's gonna be someone someday.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.600
I also need to take care of my brother as well.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:19.350
So cold.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.250
So cold.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.290
Aren't you cold?

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.260
Nope. I worn a lot.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.980
What are you doing?

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.400
Can't you behave yourself

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.190
as a woman?

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:38.830
You don't behave yourself as a man.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.690
Why should I care about that?

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.920
Give it to me.

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.590
Ridiculous!

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.350
Will you join me?

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.400
No.

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.560
The coat is warm.

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.160
You are really not cold?

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.920
Of course, it's cold! I'm freezing to death.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:08.290
So why you don't join me.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.760
Whatever. What can we do?

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.000
We can't sit here for whole night.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.010
We don't have any choice,

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.160
but stay here tonight.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.120
You really don't want it?

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.680
See the moon.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.160
It's a full moon. Like egg custard.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.800
You must be hungry.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.900
My mom used to cook delicious egg custard for me when I was a child.

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.830
I've never eaten such

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:50.400
delicious egg custard

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.470
since she passed away.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:56.900
Close your eyes and have a sleep.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.380
You won't feel hungry while you are asleep.

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.590
Officer Zheng.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.110
You are so diligent.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.640
Practicing your Kungfu this early?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.800
Young blood.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.400
Where's Magistrate Tang?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.680
Magistrate Tang?

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.640
Didn't he go to autopsy room last night?

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:46.680
Autopsy?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.070
Where's Tang?

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.520
Isn't he in his room?

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:55.000
Nope.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.800
Where did he go?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.710
Bow to each other. You are husband and wife now.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.590
Wait. What is this situation?

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.400
Honey, it's me.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.760
Zhu Dacong? Why are you here?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:18.590
Honey, it's our big day.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.190
From now on, you are my wife.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:22.400
I am your husband.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.470
Bullshit! I won't marry you.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.710
Honey, even the ceremony is over.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.590
Now we should take the next step.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:32.430
Go away. I won't marry you.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.040
Why does my hand hurt so bad?

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:36.590
What do you think?

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.640
Why are you covering your face?

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.680
What do you think?

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.760
Is it because of me?

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.710
What do you think?

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.710
I'm having tinnitus.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.280
I had a dream.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.110
Who is so blind

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:54.110
that he wants to marry you?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.830
Doesn't he fear getting hit?

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.680
A lot of men wanna marry me.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.560
If it's true,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.470
just pick a guy and marry him

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.000
before he regrets it. Or it will be a pity.

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.190
Pity for what?

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.310
It's his fortune to marry me.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.340
Thank god, I don't have such fortune.

00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.470
Exactly!

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:16.710
Thanks for not marrying me.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.560
Someone's coming.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.590
My lord, why are you here?

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:27.760
Everyone is looking for you!

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.470
Hurry up.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:30.680
Let's go.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.880
Your clothes.

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.470
Slow down. My feet hurt.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.070
Enough. Don't cry.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:49.430
It's no use to cry.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.280
It'll be fine.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.560
His lordship must be with the adviser.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.000
Don't mention her.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:54.880
It's her fault

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.070
that our lord didn't come back at night.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.400
How can I report to Madam?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.350
Muskmelon,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.830
are you still thinking about Madam's promise

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.830
that she would let you be his lorship's close maid?

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.680
Not close maid. Concubine. Do you understand?

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.190
How's it better?

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.160
You'll be inferior to others.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.470
You...

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.190
His lordship is back.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.590
Where did you go last night, my lord?

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:20.350
We're worrying about you.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.350
My lord.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.000
Thanks to Cong Shun,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.230
I've just come back from the autopsy room.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.520
What?

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.920
Wash it.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.280
Adviser, I'll go check the autopsy room.

00:23:53.070 --> 00:23:54.950
Wash it? What a neat freak you are!

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.470
I'm gonna stamp it.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.070
I won't wash.

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.880
Tang Feilong, you are such a big evil.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.590
I am an adviser!

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.640
How can I be miserable like this!

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.160
How can I be

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:16.230
Zucchini,

00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:17.400
bring me some water.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.160
Adviser.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.350
The hot water is for my lord to take bath.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.400
You've already ran back and forth 30 times.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.070
Is he taking a bath or an epilation?

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.000
What a serious neat freak!

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.950
Why so angry, adviser?

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.000
I'm washing clothes.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.590
Here. Wash mine too.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.400
Go away.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.280
Tang has bathed for so long!

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.400
The Qi Family have already arrived.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.280
Really?

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:45.760
Yep!

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.710
I'll call him.

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:47.520
What about the clothes?

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.350
You help me to wash it.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.560
Me?

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.190
Hold court trial.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.190
Your Honor,

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.560
please help me.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.230
Landlord Qi,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.110
when was your daughter missing?

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.560
I remembered to see her

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.680
at night on 8th.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.680
But in the morning on 9th,

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.560
she went missing.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.110
It's been seven days form 9th till now.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.590
Why you report so late?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.880
That's because... That's because I thought

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.590
I thought our lady just ran away from home.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.680
Why did she run away from home?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.070
Your Honor, here's the thing,

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:43.000
I came to an agreement with the Sun Family.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.520
that my daughter will marry their young master Sun Bufan

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.350
on 15th next month.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.760
But I never expected that

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.470
it would turn out to be beravement.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.880
My lord.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:01.520
In this case, officer Zheng,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.230
summon Sun Bufan in the afternoon.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.880
Hui, Hui...

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880
Your Honor,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.640
she was fine back then, why it happened so suddenly?

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.640
Why are you coming here?

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.950
This is County Office. You can't run wild here.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:20.230
Go back now!

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:22.590
Uncle, let me see her, please.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.520
Let me see her for the last time.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.710
Is he Sun Bufan?

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:32.470
My Honor, he's my distantly related nephew.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.070
My daughter's elder cousin Wei Zitong.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.280
Your Honor,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:41.430
this shameless nephew

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.190
was coveting my daughter.

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:48.520
He pestered my daughter a lot.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.710
Is there any use to say that?

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.280
Let me see Hui, please.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.430
You wanna see her?

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.880
Only if

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:57.680
I'm dead.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.110
My lord.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:03.470
Wake up, my lord.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.950
The cousin seems very sad.

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.470
Is there anything wrong for him to

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.470
see his younger cousin?

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.430
No.

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:12.070
No way.

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.230
My daughter hasn't married.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:17.110
How can she be seen by a man casually?

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.560
Okay.

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.070
Landlord Qi,

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.920
go back and have a rest.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.880
And this guy, he is involved in this case,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.920
he will stay to help with investigation.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.950
Qi Hui must be killed for love.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.280
How so?

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:40.000
I used to think that her fiance is from a rich family,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.950
he's a playboy,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:43.280
so there must be a lot of girls admiring him.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.310
Maybe one of them

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:48.520
hold malice towards Qi Hui and killed her.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:51.430
But when I saw Wei Zitong today,

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.040
I found that there is another possibility.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.710
He killed the person he couldn't get.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.800
No way.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.110
Why?

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.040
The Qi Family is rich.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.680
Why did Qi Hui wear so shabby like a wench ?

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:11.400
Unless she chose to run away herself.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.040
I see. She ran away from her marriage.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.590
What do you think of this Wei Zitong's feelings

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:22.920
towards Qi Hui?

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:24.640
Based on the scene today,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.160
it's definite true love.

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:28.350
Landlord Qi doesn't think so.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.560
One-sided love is also a kind of love.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.710
Love is the longest emotion in the world.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.520
Good calligraphy! It must be written by a handsome man.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.830
How do you know?

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.760
See. The signature is Tang Tianyuan.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.950
My lord,

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.920
didn't you say you don't know Tang Tianyuan?

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.230
How can you have his fan?

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.000
Well, an colleague gave it to me

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.400
before.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.000
It's a waste.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.310
Do you know how many people

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.590
want Tang Tianyuan's personal gadget?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.520
There's no bonds between you and him.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:22.760
The bond between me and him is...

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:33.310
It's you?!

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.710
No.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:37.470
What?

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:40.310
My lord,

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.040
the bond between Tang Tianyuan and me

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.040
is like destined.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.830
Although Tang Tianyuan looks very

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:50.590
amorous,

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.070
but actually he's a gentleman.

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.070
Listen, human can disguise

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.160
but his handwriting can't.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.310
You know about this too?

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:09.230
The best goodness is like water.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.640
My lord, have some fruits.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.350
Tang Tianyuan.

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:13.880
Okay, bring it to my room. I'll eat them later.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:14.950
Yes.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:23.400
His lordship will eat them later.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:25.560
Take it.

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:32.000
I'll excuse myself. My lord.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.400
My lord.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.950
Go on.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.590
Muskmelon had some misunderstanding

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.760
with me before.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.070
But, in order to make it clear,

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.070
I've already told everything to her.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.230
I told her,

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:57.400
I, Tan Lingyin, won't be distracted,

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.430
my heart is only for Tang Tianyuan.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:07.920
Are you okay?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.760
I'm fine.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:11.590
My lord,

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.430
could you give me the fan

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.430
considering my affection towards Tang Tianyuan?

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:19.430
No way.

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:24.280
Then could you borrow it to me for some days?

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.680
It's too precious to lend.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:32.640
So mean.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.680
What's wrong? Qingchen.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.230
Are you okay?

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.400
I heard something

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.710
in the streets today.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.520
About Qi Hui's death?

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.760
They said you are also responsible

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:00.680
for her death.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:03.400
Since we promoted our new book,

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:04.310
they all said that

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:05.430
Qi Hui died because she was misled

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.830
by Miaomiaosheng's story.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.000
I've explained it for many times.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.160
They just kept talking. So annoying.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.830
Did they go to the County Office for you?

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.560
Nope. They don't know I am Miaomiaosheng.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.000
What's more. A straight foot is not afraid of a crooked shoe.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.400
This case will be solved one day.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.710
Eat.

00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:28.350
Before that day coming,

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.280
I'll do some cleaning with Fang and Zhuang.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.470
And close the bookstore for a few days.

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:32.560
So that those busybodies

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.310
won't wander around the front door.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.350
Right.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:36.040
Yep.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.110
What's right? Are you silly?

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.920
He who excuses himself accuses himself.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.710
We don't need to be afraid if we never do wrong.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:48.280
Though we should be friendly to our customers,

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.350
we still need to be tough

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:50.920
to those trouble makers.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.830
But isn't this case bothering you?

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.560
Nope.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:57.800
As a female adviser,

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.350
I have heard a lot rumors.

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:01.680
In my opinion, life is full of ups and downs,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.310
If I can't endure such difficulties,

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.350
how can I make my own living?

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.520
Besides,

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.950
I think Magistrate Tang will find out the murderer.

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.590
I believe in him.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.310
Your Honor,

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.310
I and my cousin grew up together.

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.520
We're attached to each other.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.000
She didn't like that Sun Bufan.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.950
And she didn't agree on this marriage.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.230
My lord, both sides must present their opinions.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.920
Why not bring Sun Bufan and Yu Huan together here?

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.760
Okay.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.560
Come up here.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:44.070
Your Honor.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:46.590
What were you doing on the day Qi Hui died?

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.110
I had been preparing for the Wedding Banquet

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.110
for nearly half a month.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.000
I was tired out every day.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.070
So, I went to sleep at about 9 pm.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.430
It was the same that night.

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:02.310
But Qi Hui's cousin said,

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.950
they fell in love with each other.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.800
Yu Huan, you knew your lady well.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.630
What's your opinion?

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.120
Your Honor, my lady had rarely met Wei Zitong

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.560
in the past ten years.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.160
How is that possible that they fell in love?

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:18.520
Liar!

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.949
I grew up with Hui.

00:34:20.949 --> 00:34:22.149
Even we didn't see each other a lot,

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:25.630
we still wrote to each other frequently, Your Honor.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:30.280
If they don't believe what her personal maid said,

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.469
how should they even believe you,

00:34:33.469 --> 00:34:34.629
this opportunist?

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.230
I believe in justice.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.600
If we can't get justice,

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.390
Hui wouldn't rest in peace.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.630
Hui promised to get married with me.

00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:46.840
How would she fall in love with a despicable man like you!

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:48.630
Even my family fortunes declined,

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.909
but I read the books of sages,

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:53.279
and behave as a gentleman, how can I be despicable?

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.560
What did you say?

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:59.520
It's a hilarious. Your Honor.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:04.190
Isn't having an affair despicable? Bah.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.120
I'm gonna kill you.

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.910
This is County Office.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:13.320
My lord. Shall we stop them?

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:13.760
My lord.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.760
They won't go too serious.

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.910
Two scholars.

00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:20.080
Their fight is like tickling.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.470
How could you...

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:23.000
Go to hell.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:23.870
I'm gonna kill you.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.520
Stop!

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.190
Let go.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.560
Enough!

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:29.320
So bold.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:30.000
Imprudence.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.190
Stop fighting. Listen to me!

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.910
Your Honor.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:48.630
My lord, the folks keep saying that Qi Hui's death

00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:50.470
is related to Miaomiaosheng's novel.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
As a manager in Gutang Bookstore,

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.120
our adviser shouldn't take part in this case.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.150
But after leaving the court,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.120
she went to ask Wei Zitong in private.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.080
She's acting suspiciously.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:00.430
Adviser,

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:01.840
is it true?

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.600
I've put up with you for a long time.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.280
I became the adviser because of my capability.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.870
Don't suppose I'm inferior to you just because I'm a girl.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.630
Stop blaming me for everything.

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.390
County Office has its own rule.

00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:13.230
I'm just following the rule.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:17.150
Adviser Tan, I'll deduct your salary for one month.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.560
For what?

00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:19.710
Wise move.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.230
It's all your fault.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.230
I'm here for making money.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.710
All people say Qi Hui's death

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.910
is related to Miaomiaosheng.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.430
But they never really care about Qi Hui.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:33.800
She wore shabby clothes

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.600
and died alone in the mountain.

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.630
And she was choked to death.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.760
But this is exact the same as in your novel.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:47.840
That is my first draft before I came to County Office.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.520
It's not finalized.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:51.230
So where's the draft now?

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:52.520
Has anyone else seen it?

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.800
Oops. It's still in the study of County Office.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.230
On a dark and windy night,

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.280
the chilly wind keeps blowing,

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:27.520
Ms. Gao gets very frightened.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.320
But for the one she loves,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.080
she chose to attend the date regardless of danger.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:38.080
But Mr. Miao is not here.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.320
I'm the manager.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.600
Why are you looking for him?

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:43.390
Mr. Miao must get inspired

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.320
after hearing his stories.

00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:02.760
Our traveler Miaomiaosheng!
