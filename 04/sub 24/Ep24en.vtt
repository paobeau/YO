[Catch the Wind] 
  <i>[Lyricist - Zhao Tao] [Composer - Zhao Tao/ Daryl K]</i>

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.470
<i> ♫ Close your eyes. I am so, so, so captivated by you like this ♫ </i>

3
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.170
<i> ♫ You fell into my colorful dream from last night ♫ </i>

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.380
<i>♫ I want to work hard to gain your attention ♫</i>

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.350
<i> ♫ Laying in your embrace ♫</i>

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.780
<i> ♫ Listening to the sounds of rain outside the window ♫</i>

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.760
<i>♫ I can speak first ♫</i>

8
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.140
<i> ♫ I want to accompany you to go catch the wind ♫</i>

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.120
<i> ♫ Daydreaming together, a dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

10
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
<i>♫ A dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.250
<i> ♫ Just want to wait until the rain falls first, slowly making your hair wet ♫</i>

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.310
<i>♫ I seem to have used some kind of magic ♫</i>

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.910
<i>♫ Even a frozen river can melt ♫</i>

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.880
<i> ♫ Is it like Zhuang Zhou's dream of becoming a butterfly? ♫</i>

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.780
<i>♫ You are a blessing and a blight ♫</i>

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.910
<i>♫ Then just accept it, accompanying you in a peaceful and clear night ♫</i>

17
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.610
<i> ♫ Listening to the temple's monk ringing the bell ♫</i>

18
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.530
<i> ♫ Laying at the  Mount Nan loft relaxing ♫</i>

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.930
<i>♫ For you I hid my tears ♫</i>

20
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.610
<i>♫ Abandoned worldly affairs. I will find you no matter the time and place ♫</i>

21
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.450
<i>♫ It's you for the rest of my life. I want to be closer to you ♫</i>

22
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.970
<i>♫ Meeting you in the mortal world ♫</i>

23
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.680
<i> ♫Meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

24
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.360
<i> ♫Meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.870
<i>♫ Meeting you, meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

26
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.210
<i>♫ Listening to the sounds of rain outside the window ♫</i>

27
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.250
<i>♫ I can speak first ♫</i>

28
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.610
<i>♫ I want to accompany you to go catch the wind ♫</i>

29
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.430
<i>♫ Daydreaming together, a dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

30
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.300
<i> ♫ A dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

35
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.980
They won't even investigate, and they will carry out the execution?

36
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.540
Let go, let go.

37
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.070
Ruyi.

38
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.680
Zong Yinglin died.

39
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.390
Died?

40
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.880
How did he die?

41
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.060
He was assassinated.

42
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.100
Killed by a single strike of a sword.

43
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.720
Ruyi. Ruyi, don't cry.

44
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.230
Sorry, I'm wrong.

45
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.830
It was so sudden. I wasn't able to get the truth of what happened from Master Tang.

46
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.380
So I made my own conclusion based on the evidence.

47
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.930
Advisor Tan already told me who the real culprit is yesterday,

48
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.470
but I didn't know what to say.

49
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.710
Ruyi.

50
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.280
You...

51
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.460
won't forgive me, right?

52
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.500
That's right.

53
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.340
Anyone would suspect that I did it.

54
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.010
Head constable Zheng.

55
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.180
Can I go now?

56
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.290
You can.

57
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.350
- You're free. 
 - Free?

58
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.240
Since my birth.

59
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.480
In my daily life, in my life,

60
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.740
It's all Lord Zong.

61
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.020
It's true that he has exploited me before.

62
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.040
But he was still worried about me before he left.

63
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.040
He said he'll take me.

64
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.080
He'll take me to start a new life.

65
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
I treated him as if he was actually my dad.

66
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.340
-He is not your family.
-He isn't and neither are you.

67
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.150
Ruyi, Ruyi.

68
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.070
I know that I'm wrong.

69
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.980
Can you hate me for this?

70
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.940
I don't hate you.

71
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.070
You don't deserve my forgiveness either.

72
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.560
<i> ♫ Listen to the wind ♫</i>

73
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.340
Why are you going? To get revenge for Zong Yinglin?

74
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.580
<i> ♫ Accompanied by pear blossoms, I drink until drunk  ♫</i>

75
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.890
<i> ♫ And another cup ♫</i>

76
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.890
Miss Jiang.

77
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.140
Please come in.

78
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.730
-What's wrong?
-Lord Zong

79
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.380
is dead.

80
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.940
This.

81
00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.020
This is...Zheng Shaofeng's jade pendant.

82
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.660
Lord Tang is really evil.

83
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.560
Sir Zong obviously already intended to seek shelter from him.

84
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.470
But in spite of everything he tried to murder him.

85
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.070
I must

86
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.820
get revenge.

87
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.330
I knew that this would be a problem.

88
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.440
Advisor, do you think Master is really going to die soon?

89
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.340
Are you stupid?

90
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.450
Didn't you hear the doctor? Although there isn't a lot of ginseng and goji here

91
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.640
and will raise the fever, but it won't kill the person.

92
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.460
We just have to make the medicine correctly.

93
00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.970
Don't cry, okay? You can't cry either when you go back.

94
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.100
Remember, the person who came with you
to get medicine is Xiang Gua not me.

95
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.950
When you go back to change the medicine you must avoid Jiang Muchun. Make sure Master drinks the medicine.

96
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.180
Advisor, why don't you go back with me?

97
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.740
With you here, we'll be not as worried.

98
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:54.940
Xiao Feilong. Xiao Feilong, where did you go?

99
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.030
You still seem quite lively.

100
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.000
How is Tan Lingyin?

101
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.400
She's already eager to give it a try.

102
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.800
Climbing walls and trees. I've already caught her several times now.

103
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.990
But she's still calm at the moment. She hasn't done anything rash to Jiang Muchun.

104
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.680
You have to take care of Duan Feng.

105
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.580
But how long must we do this for?

106
00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:34.580
When do you plan to make a move?

107
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.520
Jiang Muchun is afraid of me making a move.

108
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.390
She already planned all this before she came to Tongling.

109
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.090
And from Zong Yinglin's perspective, everything is his now.

110
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:49.080
All the people in the County Office are his. We can only

111
00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:53.170
follow what we wants.  
 - Still Zong Yinglin?

112
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.380
Zong Yinglin is already dead.

113
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.490
Then what about Zhou Zhengdao?

114
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.310
You already knew about this?

115
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.230
Okay, he is one of your people.

116
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.060
As long as you deal with it appropriately, I will pretend I don't know.

117
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.150
<i> [Be of good virtue and diligent] </i>

118
00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:29.060
Wait.

119
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.170
Why are you wearing a face veil?

120
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.340
Did you catch an infectious disease?

121
00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:40.660
To reply to Miss Jiang, Xiang Gua was bitten by an insect recently on her hand.

122
00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:44.340
And was bitten on the face, she even broke the skin on her hand from scratching it.

123
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.410
-So that's why she's wearing a face veil. Right, Xi Hulu?
-Yes.

124
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.840
If this is the case, why are you in such a rush to serve?

125
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.140
Go rest.

126
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.610
Xiang Gua, get me a blanket.

127
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.200
Sir. I miss you.

128
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.940
I originally wanted to wait for you. But...

129
00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.750
I can't wait anymore.

130
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:44.560
I'm scared you-

131
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.220
I'm scared.

132
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.950
What are you scared of?

133
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.720
You know it's me?

134
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.410
Of course.

135
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:57.070
If I wasn't the one who called you in.

136
00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.730
You would have been caught by Jiang Muchun.

137
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.580
Your head is so acute. I can tell straightaway that you're pretending to be ill.

138
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.810
Who can stop Zheng Shaofeng's skill?

139
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.540
And send me medicine at night.

140
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.830
If you are better than why are you lying down?

141
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:16.930
There is movement.

142
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.510
-Why are you here again? 
-I forgot to take the medicine.

143
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.940
Oh.

144
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.230
What's wrong with your blanket?

145
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.860
I just saw it move.

146
00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:42.130
Your-

147
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:45.560
I'm sorry for interrupting.

148
00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.260
It's not like that.

149
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.800
Yes.

150
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.260
It's okay. It's okay, I understand this type of situation the best.

151
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.750
You guys can continue. I have something else to do so I will leave first.

152
00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.770
No... I thought you were Jiang Muchun.

153
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.360
Why are you here before the food has been served?

154
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:08.470
I wanted to say that the guards at the door have already been changed even though it's not 9:00pm yet.

155
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.630
I wanted to use this chance to get Advisor Tan to come and visit you.

156
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:17.180
But seeing this, I guess it's not needed.

157
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.460
That's good. I'll come visit you often.

158
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:25.140
When you came in before, did anyone stop you?

159
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.630
There was but you called me in.

160
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.970
She is not that easy to trick.

161
00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:39.170
I understand. If she kills me then she will never find the gold.

162
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.870
But by keeping me in this room,

163
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.030
I will keep my mouth shut forever.

164
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.510
She has acted for too long

165
00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.120
and she can't wait any longer.

166
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.000
Then are you saying...

167
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.420
She has purposely let us in?

168
00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.100
It's getting late. How about...

169
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:03.490
Oh! I have something to do! You guys continue, I won't bother you guys. I will leave first.

170
00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.100
Who is going to continue? I'm going to leave too.

171
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:14.030
<i> Phoenix Village</i>

172
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.940
What's wrong with you guys?

173
00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:32.060
A lot of brothers have died.

174
00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.400
Right now, nowhere outside is as safe as the fortified village.

175
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.210
How do they look like? Did you see them?

176
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.240
How can we see it clearly?

177
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.750
Coming back alive was hard enough.

178
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.330
That's right. They were really mean.

179
00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.960
Their swords moved really fast.

180
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.510
They cut our swords in half.

181
00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.770
Boss. What are you thinking of?

182
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:03.370
I must contact the people at the bottom of the mountain.

183
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:04.800
Go quickly. Get Xiao Bai to come here.

184
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.080
Forget it, Big Brother.

185

<i> [Be of good virtue and diligent] </i>

186
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.250
Lord, this is the pigeon soup that I just made.

187
00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.730
Try it while it's hot.

188
00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.130
Thank you Miss Jiang.

189
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.830
I am not in the mood to drink it. I will try it later.

190
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.200
Okay. Then...

191
00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.300
I will put on some medicine for you.

192
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.010
Wait!

193
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.140
Master and I haven't seen each other for a long time. I've longed for this moment.

194
00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.670
Today, I really can't stop myself.

195
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.540
Miss Jiang, please forgive me.

196
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.100
Coming into Lord Tang's room,

197
00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.870
is a violation of the imperial edict.

198
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.970
I see he's already better.

199
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.740
Don't you dare be lazy. You still have to go back to the county office to work on cases.

200
00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.410
Yes, yes, yes. This is reasonable.

201
00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.840
Official work is important.

202
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.700
Has the map of Mount Tianmu been drawn?

203
00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.500
Not yet. Without advisor,

204
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.410
How could he be in the mood to handle a case?

205
00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.170
The suspicions regarding the Advisor still haven't been cleared.

206
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.780
You know it best.

207
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.990
Zheng Shaofeng, pay attention to appropriate behaviour.

208
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.020
Miss Jiang, it's like this.

209
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.370
If there is no Advisor Tan,

210
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.270
even if we got the map

211
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.440
we can't find the gold.

212
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.680
That's right. Only the bandit knows about the map.

213
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.470
But the bandit only believes our Advisor.

214
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:45.130
So we can only thank you for your trouble, Miss Jiang.

215
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.900
Okay. I will have someone

216
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.310
bring Advisor Tan back.

217
00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:56.100
But Lord, the gold case is important

218
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.910
however, your health is also important.

219
00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:04.730
Don't feel when the time comes that the gold cannot be found and the person is gone

220
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:06.440
That the gains really do not make up for the losses.

221
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.610
What Miss Jiang is trying to say.

222
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:12.510
I can still tell the difference between money and health.

223
00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:15.960
I will make sure that your wish is fulfilled.

224
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:26.040
<i> [Tongling County Office] </i>

225
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:38.520
Look at what the crazy woman did. Our county office is so quiet.

226
00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.800
Where did everyone go? Why is there no one?

227
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.740
Your Miss Jiang said Advisor Tan wanted to kill you.

228
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.210
Xiaoliu and Dawang were so mad that

229
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.480
they took off their Constable uniform and went to struggle with Advisor.

230
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.140
What about Zhou Zhengdao?

231
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.020
She left.

232
00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.740
Where did she go?

233
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.710
I ask everytime.

234
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.660
Your way of apologizing is giving her freedom?

235
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.950
Don't you think this is very generous?

236
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.710
And...and..a little bit weighed down with sorrow.

237
00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.600
Even though she takes orders from Zong Yinglin,

238
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.200
But she has repeatedly helped us with the strength of one arm. What does this mean?

239
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.330
it means she has a good heart.

240
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.570
Butt you treated her like that. If it was me

241
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.010
I would have killed you.

242
00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:38.670
-You don't blame her? 
-Of course I don't.

243
00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.540
I would blame it on you being able to get her to come back

244
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.040
but not capable of keeping her here.

245
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.300
Then I will go find her.

246
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.840
Wait.

247
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.030
Zong Yinglin's death is a big hit on her.

248
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.840
I personally think the best way to repay her

249
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.230
is to find the real culprit.

250
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.730
That makes sense.

251
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.320
Miss Jiang.

252
00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:14.360
Take this.

253
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.980
Cong Shun take this letter

254
00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.400
Arrange for someone to send to to my Father as quickly as possible.

255
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.810
Make him act quickly and send someone to help me.

256
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.000
Miss Jiang, you are going-

257
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.640
I am determined to win the gold.

258
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.980
- But—
- Cong Shun, Master Zong's death was miserable.

259
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.960
No one paid their last respects. He raised you for 20 years.

260
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.970
Don't you want to personally get revenge for him?

261
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:47.070
But...But Ruyi...Did Ruyi really defect to the the other side?

262
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:50.910
Was she tricked by them?

263
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:52.970
No matter if she was tricked,

264
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.400
things are already like this.

265
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.890
Even if Sir Zong is dead and cannot come back to life,

266
00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:01.400
But you are different.

267
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.450
You can fulfil his unfulfilled ambition for him.

268
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.340
This subordinate is determined to obtain blood vengeance for my adoptive father.

269
00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:17.600
That's right. That group of bandits on Phoenix Mountain aren't very useful.

270
00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:20.500
In order to avoid allowing them to gossip and cause trouble,

271
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.240
Send Anwei to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots as quickly as possible.

272
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.570
It's already being taken care of. Don't worry.

273
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.000
Is it pretty?

274
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.400
This place is really nice.

275
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.800
Of course. Let me tell you. In the future, there will be even better ones.

276
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.000
You guys have to continue to come!

277
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.400
-Really?
-Really. 
-That's great!

278
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.800
Brother, I am here!

279
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.000
We're closing up now.

280
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
My creditor is here. To prevent harm to innocent people.

281
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.300
-Quickly go, go.
-Let's go.

282
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.800
What are you doing? How did you come here?

283
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.000
I walked here. Did you miss me?

284
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.800
You walked here? Are you even allowed to be outside?

285
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.100
Hurry!

286
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.400
Let's go.

287
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.900
Duan Feng! Are you silly?

288
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.200
You've been given freedom for a few days and you really   do not consider yourself a bandit.

289
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.600
If you get caught, I have to use time to save you.

290
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.000
You care about me.

291
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
How about, let's not be brothers.

292
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.400
- Then go die. 
- Alright, alright, alright.

293
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.600
Oh yeah. Did you see Xiao Bai?

294
00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.400
That big fat pigeon?

295
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.800
No.

296
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.800
That's weird.

297
00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:03.800
Xiao Bai went to the County Office yesterday and still hasn't come back.

298
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:06.800
Maybe he was kidnapped by a female pigeon on the way?

299
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.600
How is that weird?

300
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.700
That's true.

301
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:14.600
Then I have to tell you myself.

302
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.400
What happened?

303
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.400
The brothers of the village were recently killed in succession.

304
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.400
I have my suspicions that it is the doings of that group of assassins from before on Tianmu Mountain.

305
00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.200
That group appears and disappears like ghosts and is matchless in their savagery.

306
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.800
Even my brothers that had drifted away and were innocent died violent deaths.

307
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:34.300
Linying, I think you need leave here earlier.

308
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
The village does not seem safe.

309
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.600
Should I tell Lord Tang to send people to protect you guys?

310
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.200
You want County Officers to protect Bandits?

311
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.700
Is it that you look down upon our village or that you look down upon those in the county office?

312
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:51.970
Having good intentions does not result in any reward.

313
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.100
I'm worried about you.

314
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.600
The gold case is not that simple. The master mind

315
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.900
will do anything to get the gold.

316
00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.000
For your safety, you have to leave here.

317
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.200
I can't leave Lord Tang here alone.

318
00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.000
He is a big man, he can take care of himself.

319
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.800
No.

320
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.000
No matter how dangerous the path is, I have to be with him.

321
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
How come you can't tell what's good for yourself?

322
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.400
This who left whom and then not being able to live won't do. Surviving is what's important!

323
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.400
No. I want Lord Tang.

324
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.200
We were brothers for a period. I, Duan Feng, will risk my life to accompany you of noble character.

325
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.400
I will protect you.

326
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.400
Duan Feng, I chose the right brother.

327
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.900
In any case, the  gold we stole has almost all be spent now.

328
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.800
So the gold in the county was really spent by you?

329
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.400
Or else? Hold the gold and silver in our hands?

330
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.200
Not spending it would be a waste. Do you take me for a fool? Otherwise, who did you think it was?

331
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.000
-We thought-
-Is there anyone up there?

332
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.600
Hurry and go back to Mount Tianmu. Don't let anyone know that you came here today.

333
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.300
Hurry and go.

334

354
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.800
Time to eat!

355
00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.140
Look at the oil all over your mouth,

356
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:04.940
Hold this.

357
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.400
I was seen when I came in, but no one stopped me.

358
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.700
That's of course, I asked Jiang Muchun to get you.

359
00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.800
What? You sold yourself?

360
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:19.600
I didn't sell myself.

361
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.000
I just told her that I would find the gold.

362
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.600
It would be better to sell yourself.

363
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.200
Really?

364
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.100
I will look for her tonight and tell her.

365
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.000
When I went to Miaosheng House earlier,
there were barely anyone.

366
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.100
It doesn't have the bustling sights as before. I'm a bit at loss.

367
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.000
Do you miss Zhu Dacong?

368
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.200
Are you jealous?

369
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.600
No.

370
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.300
I just think you won't have this chance anymore.

371
00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.100
Really?

372
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.100
When I find the gold,

373
00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.400
I will propose to you.

374
00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.830
What does it have to do with me?

375
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.800
Tan Lingyin, only by taking the risk of offending influential officials and being driven out of my home by my parents

376
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.000
Could I accomplish all of these things.

377
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.100
Don't worry. Even if you can't be an official or make money,

378
00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.300
There's still me, I can raise you.

379
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.400
You raise me?

380
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.700
Then what are we eating?

381
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.000
Those delicacies from the land and sea, abalone and sea cucumber.

382
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.200
You can forget about the famous and rare things. But there will be vegetables and porridge.

383
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.100
Also roast chicken!

384
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.600
I think we should find the gold sooner.

385
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.800
Recently my mood isn't that good.

386
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.200
Thinking of ways to find some joy.

387
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.800
You can reduce your sorrow.

388
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.600
Only if...I hug you.

389
00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.200
Enough you two.

390
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.200
Come in.

391
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.600
The future is long and you'll have plenty of time for murmuring endearments.

392
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:15.700
We still have serious matters to attend to. Is there any progress on the situation with Mount Tianmu?

393
00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.010
Look here.

394
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.000
Last time I went to Mount Tianmu I found an unusual  small river that had dried up.

395
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
It should be here.

396
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.600
Sang Jie secretly mined gold last winter, which is the dry season.

397
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.800
If he hid the gold in the river then,

398
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:40.000
when it got to high water levels, that would be in spring or autumn,

399
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.600
the water would have submerged all of the gold.

400
00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.000
No wonder, I searched all of Mount Tianmu and couldn't find a gap.

401
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.900
So it was here. I'll go take a look.

402
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.000
You should go tomorrow.

403
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.200
It was raining, so it must be slippery.

404
00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.600
It's not safe to go at night.

405
00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.200
Don't worry Advisor.

406
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.000
I, the constable, have exceptional skills.

407
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Then what about Jiang Muchun?

408
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:10.590
Do we just ignore her wobbling around in the county office?

409
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.000
We can't touch her for now.

410
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.440
You still want to fight?

411
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.600
Okay.

412
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.200
Okay?

413
00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Advisor you aren't mad? Are you sick?

414
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.000
The offense that I should have taken, I've already taken. And the anger that I should have had, I have had.

415
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.800
I believe Sir has his own plan.

416
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.000
He won't allow me to be sad.

417
00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.700
Sang Jie, this old thief,

418
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.400
Where did he hide the gold?

419
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.200
I'm so tired.

420
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:00.500
I don't know where Miss Ruyi is right now.

421
00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.400
I can't.

422
00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.000
Zheng Shaofeng! Are you okay?

423
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.200
-Ruyi! 
- Be careful.

424
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.600
Slowly!

425
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.400
Follow me.

426
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.340
Look at you, how can you not be careful.

427
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.080
When the rain stops I will leave.

428
00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.640
Don't worry. I won't appear in front of you again.

429
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:54.750
You..Before

430
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:58.410
did you follow me?

431
00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.570
I originally wanted to avoid the problem by walking away.

432
00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:05.940
But Lingyin told me I should tell you.

433
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:17.380
Ruyi. I miss you.

434
00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.930
Before it was all my fault.

435
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.420
I misunderstood you.

436
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:26.470
So I didn't know what to say.

437
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.520
I really miss you.

438
00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:34.000
Before, I was the one who kept chasing after you.

439
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.340
But...But that time

440
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:39.290
I said things about breaking off relations.

441
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:42.940
I'm scared.I'm really scared that from now on,

442
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.060
we won't have a chance.

443
00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.090
Linying was right.

444
00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.230
You are an idiot.

445
00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.790
If I didn't say anything, you wouldn't have asked?

446
00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.300
I recently have been thinking,

447
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.880
am I holding you back?

448
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:20.390
But, if I don't hold you back then someone else would.

449
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.260
I am not resigned to it.

450
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.510
It's better if I do it.

451
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.640
Then?

452
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:31.760
Then...

453
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.150
Then I really want you to stay behind.

454
00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:38.730
I... I'm really scared.

455
00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.250
I'm scared to hear your answer.

456
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.800
You're not as free and at ease as before.

457
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.920
Ruyi.

458
00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.590
Can you please stay here with me?

459
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:57.100
I will take care of you, Ruyi!

Isn't Advisor back?

478
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.580
Then why do we need medicine?

479
00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:36.610
Sir asked me to stay here

480
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.650
and secretly watch that person.

481
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.040
Is there anyone that watches like you do?

482
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.670
I'm afraid that others wouldn't be able to tell that you're tailing someone.

483
00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:49.630
I haven't done it before.

484
00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:51.640
I don't have experience.

485
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.740
They are inside, you are outside.

486
00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:57.590
You wouldn't know if someone ran away. You are really stupid.

487
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.980
It's been a waste for you to follow Sir for so long. You haven't made any progress at all.

488
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.320
Miss Jiang.

489
00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.700
Xue Li and I made food,

490
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.570
the chefs all went home.

491
00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.210
If you're not used to eating this

492
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.970
When we go back to the Capital, we'll have a large kitchen.

493
00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.180
Xiang Gua.

494
00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:38.350
I came to Tongling. I didn't know the place or anyone here.

495
00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:40.080
I don't have any friends.

496
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.260
I only see you as my family.

497
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:49.310
I thought we really could be a family.

498
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:54.980
But I never thought Sir's heart was already accounted for.

499
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:57.430
It's not the two of us.

500
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.530
I still have a lot of good stuff here.

501
00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:07.200
But I don't have a reason to stay at Tongling.

502
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:09.570
I will leave it all for you.

503
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.550
Bring over the new clothes I bought.

504
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.540
Yes, Miss.

505
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:19.380
Look at them.

506
00:36:22.460 --> 00:36:25.500
Miss Jiang, these are all too expensive.

507
00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.760
I am just a servant. I'm not worthy of these things.

508
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.740
I also can't bring them with me.

509
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:33.640
I can't just throw them away.

510
00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.710
Also, I am privately giving these to you.

511
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.090
I don't have any other intentions.

512
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:43.280
Look, Suzhou embroidered skirt paired with a lily magnolia hairpin.

513
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.570
You can't beat a better pairing that this.

514
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:51.920
This... Is this really for me?

515
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.750
Of course. You're pretty, you should wear better clothes.

516
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.960
But I have to do chores,

517
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.660
so I won't be able to wear this.

518
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.440
Xiang Gua, you really like the Lord. Right?

519
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:17.470
Here, there is nothing to hide.

520
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.830
Actually, it's normal for men to have multiple wives and concubines.

521
00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:25.170
Rather than welcoming the Advisor as she enters the mansion as a concubine,

522
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.830
I am more willing

523
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.290
to become sisters with you.

524
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.270
But, the Lord has said

525
00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:41.320
he only loves the Advisor and will only marry her.

526
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.140
But your appearance isn't lacking to hers.

527
00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.680
Also, you were the first one to like the Lord.

528
00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:50.300
Everything must take into consideration that first comes, first served.

529
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:52.060
Right?

530
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:58.530
If you are willing, I can help you get rid of

531
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.700
the annoying person.

532
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:04.420
Okay? Sister?

533
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.520
Try it later.

534
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:12.190
Okay.

535
00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.620
-Miss Jiang, I'm going to go first then.
-Okay.

536
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.240
How did it go?

537
00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.650
What pretty clothes!

538
00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:46.800
These are the clothes worn by the miss of the family of this high official and noble person.

539
00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.730
It's different from ours.

540
00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.740
Xi Hulu.

541
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:55.710
You stayed by Sir's side for this long.

542
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.500
You must know a lot about him.

543
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.980
-Let me ask you a question. 
-Go ahead.

544
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.010
Before the Lord came to Tongling.

545
00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.210
Has he never cared about his marriage,

546
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.180
Furthermore, he had never been disobedient

547
00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.290
To his parents, the lord and madame.

548
00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:20.560
Then this is all Advisor Tan's fault.

549
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:23.200
If we didn't have her,

550
00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:27.260
the Lord can be anyones.

551
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:29.160
Right?


553
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.380
