(Previously on Episode 23)

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.660
I don't want to break up.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.060
I'll take good care of her.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.420
And better than you did.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.780
Madam,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.380
I'm the new part-timer.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.580
I'm Cai Yasi, sophomore of
Department of Computer Science.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.860
I won't eat,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.980
unless you take Zhou Xiao here.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.540
(Episode 24: Love that Transcends Time)

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.420
Mom, I'm coming in.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.660
Fanzhou, you can't blame her because...

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.140
I asked her to come here.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.980
You can't blame me, either.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.900
I know you love her very much

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.380
and don't want her to go back and forth here.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.220
Therefore,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.620
I bought many delicious dishes,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.780
to make up for her.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.860
I see.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.860
By the way,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.940
have you had lunch?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.100
Not yet.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.700
Alright, look.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.500
This is left for you.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.460
Enjoy.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.420
Zhou Xiao, be careful.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.820
OK.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.740
Mrs. Zhao.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.540
Here.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.580
Please have an apple.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.020
Did you have a fight?

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.140
No.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.140
Then tell him to eat the apple.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.300
He seldom

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.100
eats fruit.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.700
Help me get rid of his habit

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.860
of being picky about food.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.340
I could not handle him.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.460
I don't want to eat that.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.460
Fine.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.420
Feed him.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.820
I believe he will eat it.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.620
Why do you act so weirdly today?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.580
Eat it.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.700
Feed the whole apple to him.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.180
See?

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.420
I knew you could handle him.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.860
What's wrong?

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.100
I'm fine.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.140
It's just scraped by something.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.900
Then don't touch it.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.820
Fanzhou, take a look at it.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.140
No.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.580
It doesn't matter.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:21.700
He's a medical student.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.780
Let him take a look.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.540
Does it hurt?

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.820
No.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.820
What about here?

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.940
No.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.780
Zhou Xiao,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.700
would you like to have spicy hot pot with us?

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.260
Mrs. Zhao.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.300
Tomorrow, we...

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.820
Mom,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.620
she is not available tomorrow.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.340
Yes. I have classes all day long tomorrow.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.820
Oh, I see.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.260
How about dinner?

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.540
And after dinner,

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.380
I'll ask Fanzhou's dad
to drive you back to school.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.900
Dinner is...

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.700
She has no time for dinner, either.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.980
Then,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.900
when will you have time?

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.420
Mrs. Zhao.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.500
I have something to tell you.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.300
I will come to have dinner
with you every day,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.660
if only you won't dislike me
for eating too much.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.180
I definitely won't.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.980
I like girls who eat a lot.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.460
Mom.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.540
She can't come.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.300
But, she said...

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.900
she would have time.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.380
We have broken up.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.500
What?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.300
What did you say?

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.820
What are you talking about?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.820
Mrs. Zhao...

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.500
Zhou Xiao.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.420
I'm leaving now.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.260
What's going on?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.060
Zhou Xiao.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.620
Zhou Xiao!

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:24.740
Hello?

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.700
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.620
Are you all right?

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.460
Can you pick me up?

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:42.980
It seems I get lost.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:46.980
I'll be right there.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.020
What happened?

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.820
What do you want?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:19.100
You forget this.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.620
Thank you.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.260
Why are you crying?

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.820
I...

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.740
The thorn stabbed me. I feel painful.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.220
It's said

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.420
the pains humans could feel

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.380
are divided into 12 levels medically.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.380
That of level 12 is the severest pain.

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.820
That of level one is like
being bitten by mosquitoes.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.020
So, the pain from a thorn

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.420
should be a very light pain.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.380
Sometimes, you probably won't feel it.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.940
But why

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.620
I feel it intolerable

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.100
at one moment.

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.340
Mrs. Zhao.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.740
Please don't be too sad.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.860
Zhou Xiao was scared and wanted
to break up. It's normal.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.660
After all,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.460
Common people still have some prejudice

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.260
against mental disease.

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.940
It's all my fault.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.500
It's all because of me.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.420
Let's take the medicine, OK?

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.420
I feel so sorry for Fanzhou.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:34.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.100
Let's take the medicine, OK?

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.740
No, I don't want to take it.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:39.420
Let me do it.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.620
Mom, what's wrong?

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.100
You broke up

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.260
because of me.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.980
I'm sorry.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.780
I am to blame.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.780
I'm sorry.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.500
I'm sorry.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.940
Mom.

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.460
Please listen to me.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.660
Our breakup

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.860
has nothing to do with you. It was my fault.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.260
Your fault?

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.140
Why did you say that?

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.980
Did you

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.380
make a mistake as your dad did?

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:30.940
Did you?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.860
You dad...

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:36.980
Where is your dad? Where is he?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:37.940
Call your dad.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:38.380
Mom.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.020
Call your dad.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:39.460
Mom.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.540
Call your dad.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.100
Mom.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:41.820
Mom.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.380
Mrs. Zhao.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.340
Go get your dad.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:43.860
Mom.

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.500
Mom.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.700
Where is your dad?

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.700
Are you all right?

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.500
I'm all right.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.980
I'm all right.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.980
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.700
It doesn't matter, Mrs. Zhao.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.140
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.220
Go get your dad.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.900
Ask him to apologize for me, will you?

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.580
Call your dad. Go get your dad.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.780
OK. OK.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.180
OK.

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:10.940
Go get your dad.

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:11.300
Mom.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:11.940
Go get your dad.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:12.380
Mom.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.260
Go get your dad.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:14.700
Mom.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:15.540
Go get your dad.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.620
Go get your dad.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.420
Mom.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.340
Go get your dad.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:20.940
Listen to me,

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.940
I will call him right now.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.700
Sit down. Sit down.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.580
Sit down.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.460
I will call him right now.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.460
Mrs. Zhao.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:34.220
Go get your dad.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.540
Go get your dad.

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:37.660
Go get your dad.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.500
Dad,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:42.260
come to the hospital quickly.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.460
Hurry.

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.620
Can you walk faster, shorty?

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.500
Where are we going?

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:01.180
You'll see.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.380
I'll go back to school.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.540
Today, I will take you to a place

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.500
to relieve yourself. It's on me.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.260
No, thanks.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:13.740
Come on.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.460
No means no.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.300
Come on.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:16.980
No.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.380
What do you want?

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.140
Let me go.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.020
Let's go.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.420
Believe me, will you?

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:30.820
Here we are.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.260
Go-carting?

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.980
Yes.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.300
It's really relaxing,

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:36.660
especially for someone

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.780
who is crossed in love.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:40.740
Let's go.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.500
(Notice: We are having a three-day off.)

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.140
I'm going back.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.180
Wait a minute.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.180
I will call the boss
to open the shop right now.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:01.620
Forget it.

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.220
Reluctance is good for nothing.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.260
Why did you say so?

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:07.700
Wait and see. I'm calling him now.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:09.420
Today, I

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:10.380
will make it good for you.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.780
OK.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.620
I'm going to the washroom.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.820
OK. I will solve it before you come back.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.380
From today on,

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.460
we have to increase the dosage.

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.700
I will write a new prescription

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.060
and upload it to the system later.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:39.660
OK.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.380
Professor.

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.620
How is she...

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.180
You'd better get ready for the relapse.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.620
Please! Sir!

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:05.020
My friend really broke up with her boyfriend.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:11.340
How many people will he tell
that I was dumped?

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.260
To be honest,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:15.980
I've liked her for a long time.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.220
I feel bad

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:19.940
when she gets upset.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.180
I just want to bring her here for relaxing.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.500
Open the shop, please?

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.660
I will pay more money
if it's still inconvenient for you.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.060
You name it.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.580
If only you can send some one

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.540
to open the door.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:36.300
Thank you so much.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.420
Thank you.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.180
See? I told you I can make it.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:49.260
What did you say to the boss?

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.380
I just told him some nonsense.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.660
It was all about persuading him

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.540
to open the door.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.420
OK.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:56.660
Buckle the belt!

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.100
Be quick. Don't dilly-dally.

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.620
Are you ready?

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.500
Yes.

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.700
Hey, you could have hit me.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.260
I really hope so.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.660
What if you broke it?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.860
We have to pay for it in that case.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.940
Let me take a look.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.700
Hurry.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:25.420
Are you tired?

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.100
Nope.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.300
I saw a vending machine over there.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:41.580
I'd like to buy some drink.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.260
Would you like some?

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.700
Let me do it.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.340
No, thanks.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.660
Let me do it.

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:50.060
Hey, you haven't asked me
what I would like to have.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.780
Bring me a bottle of peach-flavored milk tea.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:59.780
I told you

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.660
I wanted peach-flavored milk tea, didn't I?

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.260
Why did you

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.420
buy this for me?

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.500
Where could I

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.060
buy that for you?

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:25.100
Why do you ogle at me like this?

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:27.940
I am not.

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.820
You like me?

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:49.140
What?

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.020
Let me know

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.660
if you like me.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.300
Why?

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:00.100
Only in that way

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.180
can I refuse you.

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.580
Take it easy. I don't like you.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.780
Really?

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.340
Yes.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.740
Then why did you

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:26.460
ogle at me just now?

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.540
My eyes are passionate.
I see everyone like that.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.580
You scared me!

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.060
I thought you liked me.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:36.740
How do you feel? One more round?

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.420
Why not?

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:43.820
Zhou Xiao.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.220
Sorry.

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.060
For what?

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.620
For I will beat you one more time.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.460
Try it.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:02.940
Sorry.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.900
I lied to you.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:07.980
I know that you don't like me now.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.420
I also know

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.460
it would get us into an awkward situation

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.340
if I admitted my keening on you.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.300
I don't want this to happen.

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:22.180
I don't want you to feel awkward, either.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.900
I can wait

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.220
till the day you like me.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.300
(Medical Records)

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.140
I'll be straight with you,

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.220
I'd suggest you to return
to Beijing for treatment

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.220
as it stands right now.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:49.300
And you'd prepare yourself
for long-term treatment.

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.860
OK. I see.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.500
Fanzhou,

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.420
you went to Beijing with your mom last time.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.180
I'd like to go this time.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.340
I will suspend my schooling.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.020
Look, we do nothing

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.980
but cleaning and studying all day long.

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.020
Especially that book.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.900
I have to say

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.020
the book has been severely damaged.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:22.780
It's unnecessary to mend it.

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.900
I don't know how you have spent the year.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.300
I didn't ask you to come.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.780
You can quit.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.380
I'm here to help you.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.980
I don't care.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:38.980
Fine.

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:41.300
You will regret it.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:44.940
I won't.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.780
I'll give you one more chance.

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.700
No, thanks.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.300
Zhou Xiao.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.220
Cai Yasi.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.540
Open the door.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.620
No way.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:05.900
Open it now.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:07.300
Come on.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.140
Open the door.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:13.100
No.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.500
You...

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:20.740
I like you.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.100
I need more time.

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.180
Let me go inside.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:46.420
No.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.340
How about just a little while?

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:48.580
No.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.820
Alright!

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:56.940
I like you too.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.020
Why are you getting mad?

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.780
I'm not going out.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:18.940
You haven't finished the cleaning yet.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.260
Do it yourself.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:22.540
Wait for me for dinner.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:23.860
OK.

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:37.740
Professor.

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:42.500
Fanzhou.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.340
You've come at the right time.

00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:47.020
Give me a hand now.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.180
My eyes have become tired.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.020
Come on.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.180
Hurry.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.980
Help me record the last two sets of data.

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.820
When you were busy with your family affairs,

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.420
I just realized

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.180
how important you were as my assistant.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.260
Luckily, you are back.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.820
Why don't you wear your white gown?

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.540
It's been only a few days,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.420
but you've forgotten the rules.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:31.740
Professor,

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:34.060
I'm here

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.660
to apply for suspending my schooling.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:37.940
Suspension?

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:40.220
Why?

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.260
My mom has a relapse.

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:44.020
I have to take her

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.540
to Beijing for treatment.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:48.580
How long will it take?

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.900
When will you come back?

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:52.580
After you come back,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.900
will you still be my assistant?

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.100
I don't know how long it will take.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.820
After coming back,

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.060
I will still be your assistant.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:10.140
Professor,

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.220
the data is here.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.140
I'm leaving now.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.420
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.500
I will wait for you.

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:43.980
Please take care.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:07.740
(Nanfang University Suspension
Application Form)

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.500
You've mended books in the library
for a whole day.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.220
So you smell

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.460
like a big tube of glue.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.300
It was all because
you weren't willing to do it.

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.180
My fingers are for computer operating.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.540
It'll be a waste if I use them to mend books.

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.820
My fingers are for writing novels.

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:32.500
Your novels

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.340
are doubtful.

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:34.900
What do you mean?

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:35.700
Nothing.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:36.940
Say it again. What do you mean?

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:37.580
I mean nothing.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:23.860
Are you sure

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:25.620
you won't go to UK with me for the match?

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.020
I really can't.

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.380
I have promised my teacher
to help arrange exhibition.

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.060
My English is poor.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:33.260
If you don't go with me,

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.260
I will be doomed.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:35.460
Come on.

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.100
Your team has sufficient logistical support.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.580
But

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.580
none of them is my girlfriend.

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:53.140
Hello.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.180
I won't agree.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.220
Come on.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.580
I've told you

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.220
I wouldn't live with others.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.140
Only Zhao Fanzhou

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.460
can be my roommate.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.580
You said you would respect my suggestion.

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.060
My suggestion is I won't agree

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:16.380
anyone else to be my roommate.

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.980
Be good.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.180
I have a phone call.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:23.340
Hello.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.260
No, I didn't mean you.

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:26.780
Yes.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:29.580
I know Zhao Fanzhou has suspended schooling.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.180
What's wrong?

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.220
Zhou Xiao.

00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:43.780
Has Zhao Fanzhou

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.900
suspended his schooling?

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:45.900
Yes.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.380
I'm sorry.

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.060
Don't worry.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.220
When the dorm keeper said she wanted
to get me another roommate,

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.780
I refused her.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.940
You are loyal to him.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:02.540
You said it!

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.380
I think so too.

00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.220
Right?

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.020
Shut up.

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.580
Why are you all staring at me?

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:36.980
You look awful when you eat.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.580
Why do you say so?

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.860
You know what, eating like this
will make food more delicious.

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.980
Advertisers prefer people who eat a lot.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:46.580
Speaking of which, I'm totally experienced.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.780
You know...

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.100
Xie Yixing.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.900
Eat more meat.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:54.180
Maybe you'll become
an advertising model soon.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.220
Why are you looking at me?

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:16.460
Forget it,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.860
I won't give my ice cream to you.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.980
I asked you to buy one for me,
but you refused.

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:20.420
You are so mean.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.020
Hey, the ice cream you are eating
was bought by me.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:30.540
Here you are.

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.420
Forget it.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:35.460

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.060

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.700
Yes. Pick the one you like.

Eating ice cream in winter

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.620

I will buy for you.

Well, I will go for my mom.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.020
Goodbye.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:26.100
Thank you for your breakfast
and ice cream. Bye.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.060
Bye-bye.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:35.700
♪devouring all the light I once saw.♪

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.020
But I can't resist anymore.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.100
The book

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.060
is good.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.060
Great.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.580
The Bloodthirsty Two-faced Medical Examiner.

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:19.860
Zhou Xiao.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:22.780
The writer's name sounds familiar.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.180
The stories

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.380
should be interesting.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.380
What are you doing?

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.500
I am reading books.

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:58.140
The book is really wonderful.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:03.300
But you are reading the copyright page.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:08.380
(The Bloodthirsty Two-faced Medical Examiner)

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:13.700
The book should not be put here.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.140
Please replace it.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.180
Excuse me.

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:42.940
What is he doing?

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.380
Excuse me, I want to buy all of them.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:51.860
OK.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.300
Please wait.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.020
He's not buying them.

00:41:57.220 --> 00:41:57.900
Excuse us.

00:41:58.380 --> 00:41:59.060
Come with me.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:41:59.860
Why are you here?

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.220
Excuse me.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:03.940
Why are you here?

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:04.620
None of your business.

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:06.220
Tell me.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:06.980
What is your conspiracy?

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.420
What do you mean by that?

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.700
I'm here to increase your sales volume.

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.300
What's wrong?

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.860
If you do this,

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.380
when my fans come
to the bookstore for the book,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.180
but they find it's sold out.
They will be sad.

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.140
Do you have any fans?

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.140
At least I got a book published.

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.300
Please have some respect for me.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.700
Wait a minute.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.900
Why are you willing to pay for my book?

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.500
I see.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.860
What do you see?

00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.100
You want to buy all my books

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:43.700
before I become popular,

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.020
so you can sell them
to my fans at a high price

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.460
after I become famous.

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.140
You want to pocket the difference.

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.700
My flight is canceled?

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.860
Yes, sir.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.620
Please change it into the latest flight, OK?

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.060
OK. Please hold on.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:08.420
Sorry, sir.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.940
We only have business class seats
for the latest flight.

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:11.940
It's OK.

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.140
I will send you a text message

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.620
about the price difference
and flight information.

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.860
Please check later.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.780
OK. Thank you.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.060
Sir,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.820
since your flight was canceled,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:26.540
can we slow down a little?

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:27.700
There is a traffic jam ahead.

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.740
The flight I changed
is only thirty minutes late.

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:32.300
So please be quick, sir.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:32.980
OK.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.060
Thank you.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.380
Why are you dragging me?

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.500
What if you scare the others?

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:54.540
How about

00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.060
I place your book on the shelf

00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.180
for bestsellers?

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.060
No. Don't do that.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:08.500
I didn't expect you
still have moral integrity.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.540
Then stop gabbling.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.180
I think

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.500
someone will notice my talent soon.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.820
I certainly can't miss the wonderful moment.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.820
We've been here for a whole day.

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.660
We even had sandwiches for lunch

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.180
at the entrance of the bookstore.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.740
What's wrong with eating at the entrance?

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:26.660
Don't you think

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.900
today's sandwich was really delicious?

00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.700
My dream must have made it delicious.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.340
Do we have to eat here?

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.820
We are not allowed to eat in the store.

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:41.380
But we can come back after eating them.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:45.260
No. What if someone buys my book
during our meal?

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.060
I will miss the impressive moment.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.020
Give me your bacon.

00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:58.580
Why?

00:44:59.140 --> 00:44:59.900
Forget it.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.140
You are so mean.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.780
Have you practiced it?

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.420
Really yummy.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.740
What you ate was a sandwich.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:27.620
But mine

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:29.340
were two pieces of bread.

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:36.580
Why do you make a fuss about it?

00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:45.220
Zhou Xiao.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.620
Look.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.660
We haven't sold any book today.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.420
It's a waste of time by staying here.

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.380
How about...

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.460
I didn't ask you to stay with me.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.980
You can leave.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.860
Cai Yasi, what's wrong with you?

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:10.620
Why are you so restless?

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.780
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:17.060
If so, then come here.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:17.580
Why?

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.820
Let me beat you

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:19.460
and...

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:20.540
I will forgive you.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.500
But you just beat me.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.620
No. It was a kick.

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.020
Then come on.

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.380
OK.

00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:28.220
Don't dodge.

00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.300
(Next Episode)
You still like her, right?

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.220
You have broken up with Zhou Xiao.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:45.940
Yichun sent you this parcel a year ago.
Why haven't you opened it?

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.700
Isn't this your genetic testing report?

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:49.460
Zhou Xiao,

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300
