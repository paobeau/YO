(Previously on Episode 13)

16
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.500
Stop hiding.

17
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.940
I need to talk to you.

18
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.740
I like you.

19
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.220
Let me buy you dinner to thank you.

20
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.100
Sure. It'll be my pleasure.

(Episode 14: Detective Zhou's Suspicion)

22
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.700
Chen Yu.

23
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
Lu, you're here.

24
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.500
Have a seat.

25
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.060
OK.

26
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.820
I just ordered a set meal
of Wagyu beef for you.

27
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.380
It's medium well.

28
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.980
Is it OK for you?

29
00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.300
Yes, thanks.

30
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.300
How was the traffic on your way here?

31
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.300
It wasn't the rush hour when I came here.

32
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.020
Not bad.

33
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.060
That's good to hear.

34
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.260
As I walked in,

35
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.100
I found this place very fancy.

36
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.980
I like it here, too.

37
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.900
What would you like to drink?

38
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.780
Liquor or juice?

39
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.060
-Excuse me, would you like to order now?
-Either is fine.

40
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.060
Leave it to me.

41
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.220
I want to have

42
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.380
what that table orders.

43
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.220
Understood.

44
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.020
Are you alone?

45
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.300
Any problem?

46
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.580
Not at all.

47
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.260
How does a psycho killer

48
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.100
kill people in all different kinds of ways?

49
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.340
Why am I doing this?

50
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.380
Why do I choose to do this?

51
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.700
I just don't want to do it anymore!

52
00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.300
Are you

53
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.220
alright?

54
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.660
It tastes delicious.

55
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.860
I come here a lot.

56
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:34.700
It's good to know that you like it here.

57
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.940
Actually,

58
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.340
we're here

59
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.740
because I want to tell you something.

60
00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.260
I think I know.

61
00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.620
Sometimes,

62
00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.900
it's for the boys to take the lead.

63
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.820
There is no rule that says

64
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.780
some words are meant to be said by boys.

65
00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:09.460
Chen Yu,

66
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.620
I like you.

67
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.740
Lu,

68
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.660
you're different

69
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:20.580
from all the other girls I met.

70
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.940
You're forthright,

71
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.980
open-minded

72
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.420
and graceful.

73
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.980
I like you, too.

74
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.940
Really?

75
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.100
Yes.

76
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.580
What's gotten

77
00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.420
into Lu?

78
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.020
I'm super hot,

79
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.860
but she dumps me.

80
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.380
How could she

81
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.580
choose that sissy?

82
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.780
What's on her mind?

83
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.460
Well,

84
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.700
just so you know,

85
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.540
I'm not like that for most of the time.

86
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.980
What do you mean

87
00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.180
by "like that"?

88
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.620
That's not important.

89
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:34.900
Anyway...

90
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.820
Nice to meet you.

91
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.500
I'm your Chinese tutor.

92
00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.220
My name is Zhou Xiao.

93
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:43.620
Nice to meet you.

94
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.140
My name is Ren Yiyang.

95
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.580
OK.

96
00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.780
I've read the file.

97
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.340
Your Chinese is not bad.

98
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.140
It's only that you have some
grammatical problems.

99
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.100
And you want to learn the difference

100
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.660
between the active and passive sentence
in Chinese language,

101
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.100
right?

102
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.820
I'm sorry, but could you please slow down?

103
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:04.140
Well,

104
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:05.340
we take

105
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.620
a pen

106
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.020
and

107
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.420
a notebook.

108
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.060
Let's get started.

109
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.660
Hey, what's up, babe?

110
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:44.540
OK.

111
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.260
I'll pack food

112
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.140
from your favorite restaurant,

113
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.540
OK?

114
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:51.740
Yes.

115
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.940
Yes.

116
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.340
Yes.

117
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.620
That's my girl.

118
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.100
Talk to you later.

119
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.940
OK.

120
00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:58.740
Bye.

121
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:04.660
Hey!

122
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.860
You bastard.

123
00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.620
How could you cheat on her?

124
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.860
It's not like that. It's a mistake.

125
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:10.660
A mistake?

126
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:12.060
Which part did I mistake?

127
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.860
My cousin is visiting me.

128
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.140
I was speaking to her on the phone.

129
00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.580
Is it your family tradition

130
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.540
to call your cousin "babe"?

131
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.140
That's how we call her in the family.

132
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.260
If you don't believe me,

133
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:22.540
I can call her now.

134
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.500
OK.

135
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.100
Call her right now.

136
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:26.900
OK.

137
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.740
(Babe)

138
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.820
(Babe)

139
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.780
What's up, my dear cousin?

140
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.660
I see.

141
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.340
But I'm warning you,

142
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.300
once you're caught cheating,

143
00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.740
I'll kick your ass.

144
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.140
Why are you quiet?

145
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.020
Hey.

146
00:09:59.180 --> 00:09:59.820
It's OK.

147
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.220
Just a friend.

148
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:02.300
OK.

149
00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.580
It's OK.

150
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:04.380
Bye.

151
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.100
Your class is very interesting.

152
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.020
Thanks.

153
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.860
I still have many questions.

154
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.780
Could you help me?

155
00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.660
Sure.

156
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:29.860
You have my number.

157
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700
I.

158
00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.860
Dinner.

159
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.380
Buy you.

160
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:43.940
You buy me dinner?

161
00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.220
Oh.

162
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.660
Sure.

163
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.420
Can I bring a friend?

164
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:48.380
Of course.

165
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.540
Zhou Xiao.

166
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.220
What brings you here?

167
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.940
I'm here to pick you up.

168
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.820
This is my student.

169
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:04.940
His name is Ren Yiyang.

170
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.700
Nice to meet you.

171
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.100
This is my...

172
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.100
See you later.

173
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.500
He just said he'd buy me dinner.

174
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.060
Why he changed his mind so quickly?

175
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.540
Why is this foreigner

176
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.540
as stingy as Cai Yasi?

177
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.260
Let's go.

178
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.660
Let's have some food.

179
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:29.220
Let's go.

180
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.140
Hurry up.

181
00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:37.140
What's the perfect angle to stab someone?

182
00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.580
Sorry, I wasn't looking.

183
00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.140
Do you have any questions for me?

184
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.220
Nope.

185
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.180
What questions?

186
00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.620
Did you leave your phone number

187
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.740
to that foreign student?

188
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:00.580
Yep.

189
00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.260
We exchanged phone numbers.

190
00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.860
It's for after-sale service
of Mandarin lesson.

191
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.260
It's the first time I've realized that

192
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.980
I'm such a good teacher.

193
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.340
If I stop writing novels someday,

194
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.660
I'd become a teacher.

195
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:13.500
And...

196
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.420
How long have you known each other?

197
00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.340
From this afternoon.

198
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:18.420
It took you one month after knowing me

199
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.860
to save my number.

200
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:22.500
So?

201
00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.180
So I'm feeling jealous.

202
00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.940
It's a fine day today.

203
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.100
Have a seat.

204
00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.020
Come on.

205
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.380
How about I delete him?

206
00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:55.620
Yes, please.

207
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.500
Ah?

208
00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.860
Are you serious?

209
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.140
It's not polite to delete his number

210
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.100
like this.

211
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.180
It's against international friendship.

212
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.820
Do you really want me to delete his number?

213
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.100
If so,

214
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.500
I guess I'll do it.

215
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.420
Fine. You don't have to do that.

216
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:40.700
Really?

217
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.700
That's great.

218
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.860
Because I didn't mean it.

219
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.180
It's weird to delete someone for no reason.

220
00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.780
You're a pig.

221
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:51.900
You're so annoying.

222
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.660
Your jealousy has just

223
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.500
inspired me!

224
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.940
Come on. Come on.

225
00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.260
See, I'm such a genius.

226
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.380
In this chapter, the heroine,
a medical student,

227
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.460
got jealous and stabbed her boyfriend
over hundred times

228
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.980
without hurting his vulnerable areas.

229
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:17.700
Thanks.

230
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.060
I've finished!

231
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:10.140
I'll check the technical terms.

232
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.260
How about you do it later in your dorm?

233
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.780
Stay quiet.

234
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.100
Zhou Xiao.

235
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.100
Zhao Fanzhou, what are you doing?

236
00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:16.700
Leave it alone.

237
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.580
It's almost done. Just a moment.

238
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:23.580
Leave me alone.

239
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:39.980
What are you doing?

240
00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:42.460
Zhao Fanzhou.

241
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.540
What are you doing?

242
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:47.820
I saved the file for you.

243
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.740
No need.

244
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.620
Zhao Fanzhou, are you out of your mind?

245
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.460
Open it.

246
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.940
Do you still need to do it?

247
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.500
Of course.

248
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.340
Do you still need to do it?

249
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.100
No, no, no.

250
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.140
Just open it.

251
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.820
I can't breathe.

252
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:13.980
Your phone is ringing.

253
00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.860
I can hear it.

254
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:18.740
Pick up the phone.

255
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.580
(Xie Yixing)

256
00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.580
Fanzhou,

257
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.380
I know you don't want
to talk to me right now.

258
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.260
But I was just crossed in love.

259
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.660
How could you not answer my phone?

260
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.500
You're so callous!

261
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:21.620
(Roster of Department of Forensic Medicine)

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.100
(University Student's Personal Information)

263
00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.940
I just don't believe it.

264
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.820
I must dig up dirt on Chen Yu.

265
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.980
Reward is offered!

266
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.660
Information about Chen Yu,
medical student enrolled in 2015,

267
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.780
is wanted.

268
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.780
Please tell me what you know in the comments.

269
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.980
He is a warm-hearted classmate.

270
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.300
What are you trying to do here?

271
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.380
I heard he is the president of Badminton Club

272
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.460
and a member of the Student Union.

273
00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:55.700
He is that super nice senior

274
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.540
who supervised our military training.

275
00:20:57.860 --> 00:20:59.140
He is so nice.

276
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.860
Why do you ask about my boyfriend?

277
00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.100
Why is he so composed?

278
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.980
Has he been in many relationships before?

279
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.300
Hey you... What are you doing?

280
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.820
I just want to fetch my bag.

281
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:36.860
Oh.

282
00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.220
Bro,

283
00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:01.020
you've finally picked up the phone.

284
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.100
Is Chen Yu around?

285
00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.780
What do you think?

286
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.340
Bye.

287
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.700
Hold on. Hold on.

288
00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:11.900
Then,

289
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.060
do you know

290
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.300
if Chen Yu has a girlfriend or not?

291
00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:15.740
I don't know.

292
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.300
I thought you two were roommates.

293
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.900
He moved out a year ago.

294
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:25.780
Well, is Zhou Xiao around?

295
00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.580
Can you ask her to find Lu?

296
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.700
She is in the middle of something.

297
00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.500
Bye.

298
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.740
Why... Why are you staring at me?

299
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:52.980
Shall we go back?

300
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.700
Why are you hiding from me?

301
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.500
No, I'm not.

302
00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:02.140
Yes, you're.

303
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:04.260
No, I'm not.

304
00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.980
Well, it's just that

305
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.180
I've never been kissed before.

306
00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:13.180
I feel a little bit...

307
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.380
Practice makes perfect.

308
00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.340
Xiao,

309
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.140
what happened to you?

310
00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.980
Do you get peeling lips?

311
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.500
Do you need my lip balm?

312
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.740
No, thanks.

313
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.940
I want to take you to the most
romantic city in Turkey.

314
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.420
Lu!

315
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:51.300
How is your first date?

316
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.380
Very nice. We're having hotpot

317
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.060
at his place next time.

318
00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.100
Wow!

319
00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.500
You're moving pretty fast.

320
00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.780
You're visiting his place.

321
00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.300
What are you thinking?

322
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.220
We're just having hotpot, that's all.

323
00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.340
Why don't you choose the dining hall?

324
00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.580
Is that not good enough for you?

325
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.340
Alright. Just stop fooling.

326
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.980
Wow!

327
00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.340
Love is so amazing!

328
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.340
Even Lu stamps.

329
00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.180
Wei, why are you even like this?

330
00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.660
You're so annoying!

331
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:24.820
You guys...

332
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.300
You're so annoying!

333
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:39.460
Fanzhou,

334
00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:40.820
why don't you ask

335
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.260
what I'm doing?

336
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.420
How come you don't show any curiosity at all?

337
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:47.340
What are you doing?

338
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.100
I'm looking for evidence
that Chen Yu is cheating.

339
00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.660
Will you help me?

340
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.220
I'm not interested.

341
00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.780
Zhao Fanzhou,

342
00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.900
I've been nice to you.

343
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:02.420
When you kicked the covers off the bed

344
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.780
during sleep,

345
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:04.700
it was me who tucked you in.

346
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.180
I put myself

347
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:13.180
out there,

348
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.660
while you have always been so callous.

349
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:18.100
Hey!

350
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.420
Alright. Alright.

351
00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.380
Are you asleep?

352
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.500
I'm lying on the bed.

353
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:08.500
Good night.

354
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.460
That's it?

355
00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.900
How could he fall asleep after that?

356
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.780
He is so calm.

357
00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.020
This can't be his first relationship.

358
00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:27.060
Xiao,

359
00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:27.940
are you still up?

360
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.420
I'm about to go to sleep.

361
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.180
Right now.

362
00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.060
Good night.

363
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:34.860
Good night.

364
00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:54.660
Does she fall asleep?

365
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.180
Fanzhou! Fanzhou!

366
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.100
Guess what I've found.

367
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.420
What?

368
00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.020
I found these

369
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.100
in Chen Yu's white coat.

370
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:08.340
A lipstick

371
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.500
and a rubber band.

372
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.340
It's the smoking gun.

373
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.700
Tomorrow, I'm gonna confront him.

374
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:14.420
OK.

375
00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:15.700
Good luck.

376
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:16.540
Fighting!

377
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.820
In today's class, we'll discuss

378
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.940
contemporary Chinese literature.

379
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.940
In the history of Chinese literature,

380
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:25.180
contemporary Chinese literature

381
00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.580
plays a very important role.

382
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.420
You must know well about

383
00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.300
Mao Dun,

384
00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.060
the founder of social analysis novels.

385
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.420
Who can tell me

386
00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.540
the masterpiece of social analysis novels?

387
00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:39.100
Wei,

388
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.300
can you raise your hand
after I finish reading this part?

389
00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:43.860
It's getting exciting.

390
00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.660
I'm sorry. It was instinct.

391
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:48.580
Zhou Xiao,

392
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.900
can you answer this question?

393
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:56.380
Well...

394
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.020
The look on your face

395
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.060
tells me

396
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.500
that you have some insightful opinions
about this question.

397
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.020
No, I don't.

398
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.780
Well.

399
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.500
Alright.

400
00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.180
Sit down, please.

401
00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.820
In the history of contemporary
Chinese literature...

402
00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.140
Now, we're gonna talk about

403
00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.220
the first step of treating
examination materials:

404
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:23.180
pretreatment.

405
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:26.980
Prepare the examination materials.

406
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.340
Adjust the acidity.

407
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.340
Extract protein.

408
00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.740
Dissociate conjugates.

409
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.860
(Be attentive.)

410
00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:34.460
And,

411
00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.140
protein can be extracted mainly by...

412
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.620
Be attentive.

413
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.220
I am attentive.

414
00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.020
Still reading the novel?

415
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.660
Like I said,

416
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.620
it's getting exciting.

417
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.500
(Have you got beard?)

418
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.900
And,

419
00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.740
protein can be extracted mainly by

420
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.620
organic solvent precipitation,

421
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.540
salt precipitation.

422
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.260
(Girls' Dormitory)

423
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.940
Lu!

424
00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.380
Lu! Hurry up! Hurry up!

425
00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:08.980
I don't have class this morning.

426
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.980
I'd sleep late.
Why do you call me to come down?

427
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.660
You'd better be serious,

428
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:14.660
otherwise I'll kill you.

429
00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:15.060
It's something really serious.

430
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.140
I mean it.

431
00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:18.700
Look.

432
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.300
So?

433
00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:22.700
I found these

434
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.660
in Chen Yu's white coat.

435
00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.140
Yesterday when you were at the restaurant,

436
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.060
I heard him on the phone with another girl.

437
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.340
Wait a moment.

438
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.780
You went through his things

439
00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:32.660
and you were stalking me?

440
00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.620
That's not the point.

441
00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.660
The point is Chen Yu is cheating on you!

442
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.260
Have you finished your story?

443
00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:41.420
If so, you're free to leave now.

444
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.100
What I'm saying is true.

445
00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:44.140
He is not a good guy.

446
00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.940
I have eyes.

447
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:45.980
I can make my own judgment.

448
00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.860
Please don't speak ill of my boyfriend
behind his back.

449
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.300
Why are you still defending him?

450
00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:53.380
Is there something wrong with you?

451
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.380
Why don't you break up with him?

452
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.420
Are you in desperate need of a boyfriend?

453
00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.620
It's not your business.

454
00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.540
Even I want a boyfriend, that won't be you.

455
00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:01.300
Fine.

456
00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.460
I guess I'm being nosy here.

457
00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:04.300
Listen,

458
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.580
if I ever stick my nose into your business,

459
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.940
I'll write my name backwards.

460
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.100
Fang Wei!

461
00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.780
What brings you here?

462
00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.420
You're not studying today?

463
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.340
Is it the end of the world?

464
00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.700
You complain about me not being here.

465
00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.020
When I'm actually here, you're mocking me.

466
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.860
I happen to be free this afternoon.
I'm taking you out.

467
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.940
Where are we going?

468
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.020
Where do you want to go?

469
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.300
Eating.

470
00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:58.380
Let's go.

471
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.500
She could have said goodbye to us.

472
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.540
It seems we don't even exist.

473
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:07.860
What's great about having a boyfriend?

474
00:32:10.060 --> 00:32:10.780
I remember

475
00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.100
you have a boyfriend, too.

476
00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.540
Where is he?

477
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:21.900
I don't know.

478
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:23.460
Let's go.

479
00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.260
Why do you seldom go to the lab these days?

480
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.940
You used to spend the whole day there.

481
00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:36.420
What happened?

482
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.140
Are you in a relationship with Zhou Xiao?

483
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.660
Don't look at me like that.

484
00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.380
You were absent-minded in the class.

485
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.540
Your eyes were fixed on the Chinese class.

486
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.260
Professor,

487
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.020
I was listening to you.

488
00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.580
I know you can multitask.

489
00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.140
I'm just curious.

490
00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:56.020
You don't even know

491
00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.620
how to be in a relationship.

492
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.740
She might find you

493
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.100
boring,

494
00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.420
indifferent,

495
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.140
weird.

496
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.540
Professor, don't take the chance to mock me.

497
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.670
I'm just kidding.

498
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.220
What's gotten into you?

499
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.220
Wei,

500
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.980
I have a problem now.

501
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:27.980
What problem? Tell me.

502
00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.780
Since we started dating,

503
00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.500
Zhao Fanzhou has been lukewarm to me.

504
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.020
Do you think he has dated many girls before?

505
00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.780
It's the first time
that I've fallen in love with someone.

506
00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.380
Is he gonna dump me?

507
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.460
Ah?

508
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:00.620
Zhao Fanzhou?

509
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:03.380
Zhao Fanzhou?

510
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.300
Zhao Fanzhou!

511
00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.420
Ah.

512
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:34.780
What am I gonna do?

513
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.780
I don't want to get dumped.

514
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.180
Xiao, what's on your mind?

515
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:43.980
Zhou Xiao.

516
00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.100
Are you free now?

517
00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.660
I need to talk to you.

518
00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.180
Are you free tonight?

519
00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:50.540
Come to my place for dinner.

520
00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.940
My wife is making a delicious meal tonight.

521
00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:56.580
Professor, I'm afraid I have a date

522
00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.900
with Zhou Xiao.

523
00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.140
Ask her to come along.

524
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.500
Alright. Alright.

525
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.060
It's a shame for you to miss the meal.

526
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.340
I worked so hard to get her

527
00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:13.820
to cook the dish of braised meat balls.

528
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:15.580
Before that,

529
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.260
she hasn't cooked for three days.

530
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.900
You got her mad again?

531
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.740
Nope.

532
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.580
It's the white or black valentine's day thing

533
00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.300
invented by you young people.

534
00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.900
I didn't buy her a gift.

535
00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:33.780
She was unhappy about it
and didn't talk to me for a few days.

536
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:35.780
So,

537
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.620
I made her

538
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.300
a piece of jewelry.

539
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.260
Now,

540
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.820
she just wouldn't take it off

541
00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.260
and brag about it all the time.

542
00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.100
Don't you think I'm very wise?

543
00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:55.460
Of course you're.

544
00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:56.780
You're just saying it to make me happy.

545
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:00.700
Don't take me for granted.

546
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.860
When I was young,

547
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.660
I used to be

548
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:06.540
romantic.

549
00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.460
Let me tell you about it.

550
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.580
If you want to please a girl,

551
00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:12.540
buy her gifts.

552
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:14.540
If you want her to be with you for good,

553
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.260
give her gifts

554
00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:17.940
made by yourself.

555
00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.860
Do you understand?

556
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:21.700
Yes, I understand.

557
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.420
I've got to go.

558
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.540
Are you saying

559
00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.580
Chen Yu is cheating on her?

560
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.860
She just wouldn't believe me.

561
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:34.940
She also said

562
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.500
even she's single,

563
00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.380
she won't take me as her boyfriend.

564
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.500
Am I that lame?

565
00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:41.740
Not at all.

566
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.660
You're just a little chatty.

567
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.740
So you believe me, right?

568
00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.180
Yes.

569
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.700
I searched my brain.

570
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.220
The other night when we went
to see the meteor shower,

571
00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:58.860
Chen Yu rejected so many calls.

572
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.340
He got many calls.

573
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.500
But perhaps it's for something serious.

574
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:04.500
Whose side are you on?

575
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:06.100
I'm on Lu's side.

576
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.580
Alright. Let's get back to business.

577
00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.860
What are we gonna do to help her?

578
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.780
Lu is

579
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:12.940
very stubborn.

580
00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.340
She won't believe

581
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.460
without proof.

582
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.900
How about you help me find the proof?

583
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.020
After all, you claim to be

584
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.300
the president of Detective Club.

585
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:23.300
What do you mean by "claim"?
I'm stating the truth.

586
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.060
Tell me about your ideas.

587
00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:26.820
The campus forum.

588
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:28.500
At the forum,
there's this girl who claims to be

589
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.060
Chen Yu's girlfriend.

590
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:32.220
I texted her but she didn't reply.

591
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:34.180
I remember you have a friend

592
00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.860
who is an excellent hacker.

593
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.980
Can you ask him to find this girl out?

594
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.620
OK. I'll ask him.

595
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.900
I'm not sure if he's in training.

596
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.500
OK.

597
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.380
(Zhao Fanzhou)

598
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:48.900
Hello.

599
00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.180
Where are you?

600
00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:50.980
I'm on my way to you.

601
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.500
I'm at the cafe with Xie Yixing.

602
00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.060
Is it Lu?

603
00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:54.820
Is it Lu?

604
00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:55.900
Move over.

605
00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.180
You're spitting on my face.

606
00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.420
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

607
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.460
It's likely she's been

608
00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.660
here and here.

609
00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:09.580
Particularly here.

610
00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:11.340
Let me see if I can

611
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.980
amplify the signal.

612
00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:13.980
Do you know this guy?

613
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:17.260
She's also been here.

614
00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:19.460
You're here.

615
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:24.940
What would you like to drink?
I'll order it for you.

616
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:25.500
I'm good.

617
00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:28.820
You're not thirsty?
I'd share your orange juice.

618
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.820
I'll take you out for drinks.
I bought movie tickets.

619
00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.300
But I'm in the middle of something.

620
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:33.540
What thing?

621
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.420
I found it.

622
00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:38.660
That's the thing.

623
00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.500
Dude, that's awesome!

624
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.260
You found Chen Yu's girlfriend

625
00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.660
within such a short time.

626
00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:45.980
I declare

627
00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:46.940
that you replace Fanzhou

628
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.180
as the person

629
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:49.940
I admire the most.

630
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.380
That's true.

631
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.740
Cai Yasi is a legend in the computer world.

632
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.300
Let's find that girl.

633
00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:00.020
-OK. Let's go. -Let's go.

634
00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.100
It's Lu's business.

635
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:04.340
Don't you think

636
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.820
it's her decision to make?

637
00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.100
That's right.

638
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.100
Lu is head over heels for Chen Yu.

639
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.460
What decision can she make?

640
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.300
Besides,

641
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.460
she has high self-esteem.

642
00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.180
She would want us to stay out of this.

643
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.580
If you're not going, I'll do it myself.

644
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:23.740
Let's go.

645
00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:24.260
Hey.

646
00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:25.620
Wait a moment.

647
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.380
Zhou Xiao! What's wrong with your friend?

648
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.340
It's none of my business!

649
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:30.580
It's none of my business!

650
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.980
Do we need to rescue Cai Yasi?

651
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.660
Nope.

652
00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:34.900
Let's start our date.

653
00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.220
Well,

654
00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.500
can we make it another time?

655
00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:48.420
Why?

656
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:50.100
It's about Lu.

657
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.380
I need to get back to the dorm

658
00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.020
to discuss about the rescue plan.

659
00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.980
It's our first date.

660
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.420
How could it be so random?

661
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.420
It must be well prepared.

662
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.300
Is this date

663
00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.460
a spontaneous thing for you?

664
00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:10.500
So...

665
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.380
I'm not going out with you.

666
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.500
I'm not an easy girl.

667
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:17.900
You...

668
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:19.660
I'm very disappointed in you.

669
00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:22.140
Is this excuse gonna work?

670
00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.580
But I really want to help Lu.

He is so good at the sweet talk!

681
00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:50.420
Lu, you just stay out of this.

682
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:53.180
I'm gonna make an impressive dinner for you.

683
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:54.380
OK.

684
00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.300
I'll just have to wait and see.

685
00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:56.820
That's right.

686
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.100
Xie Yixing told me

687
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.380
you already have a girlfriend.

688
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.500
Of course.

689
00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.260
She is right by my side.

690
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:26.980
Here you are.

691
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.300
Xie Yixing found these

692
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.940
at your dorm.

693
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.620
It belongs to my cousin.

694
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.060
She is a careless person.

695
00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:37.420
She often leaves things at my place.

696
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.340
Your cousin...

697
00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:42.620
Please hold this for me.

698
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:43.380
OK.

699
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.540
I'm gonna take this.

700
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:48.900
Wait for me.

701
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:54.660
Hello.

702
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:55.700
What's up?

703
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.260
Guess where I am.

704
00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.540
Knock it off.

705
00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:00.900
I'm in the middle of something.

706
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.460
I don't have class today.

707
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:05.020
I'm cleaning up your room.

708
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:07.540
OK.

709
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.500
Talk to you later.

710
00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.100
Bye.

711
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:27.780
What's up?

712
00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:29.700
Lu,

713
00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:31.700
it's kind of last-minute.
My dad is visiting me.

714
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.300
He has some important things to tell me.

715
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.580
I'm sorry.

716
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:38.140
I'm afraid we're not having dinner
at my place.

717
00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.660
I thought your dad

718
00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.580
is not in the town.

719
00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.460
He is here on business.
It's a random business trip.

720
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.340
I see. You should get back home now.

721
00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.340
I'm going back, too.
Let's make it another time.

722
00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:52.020
Lu,

723
00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:52.940
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.500
Are you mad at me?

725
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:56.700
No.

726
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.500
I didn't plan

727
00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.700
to meet your parents so soon.

728
00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:01.620
That's good.

729
00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:02.700
Because I'm not ready, either.

730
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.820
I'm sending you home.

731
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:06.340
OK.

732
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.060
Let's go.

733
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:10.980
Here we are.

734
00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:12.380
Bye.

735
00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:15.900
Don't leave me alone.

736
00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.220
Dude,

737
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.940
we don't know each other.

738
00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.540
If it were not for Zhou Xiao,

739
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.220
I would never do these things for you.

740
00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:24.380
Come on, dude.

741
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.820
Don't talk like that.

742
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:28.380
As the saying goes,

743
00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.820
we're all brothers and sisters.

744
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:30.740
I declare

745
00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.900
that from now on,

746
00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.500
you're my best buddy.

747
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:36.180
OK?

748
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.900
I gotta go now.

749
00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020
I'm having ACM training tomorrow.

750
00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:39.980
I have to pack my things.

751
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:47.900
This is the first time

752
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.460
for me to catch someone cheating.

753
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:51.820
I'm sort of nervous.

754
00:44:58.100 --> 00:44:59.940
(Next Episode)

755
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:00.860
Apologize to Lu.

756
00:45:01.220 --> 00:45:02.020
Apologize to her!

757
00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.580
Will you go on a date with me?

758
00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.140
As I said, I won't disappoint you.

759
00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.820
Hold on tight. Here we go.

760
00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:09.460
Because I only heard the word "kiss".
