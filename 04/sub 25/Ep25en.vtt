Leave it all to me.

Are you avoiding the food I make because it tastes bad and even gives you diarrhea?

We can't ask for everything to be perfect.

I have found that underground water channel. The underground water source links up from top to bottom.

52
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.600
There's no possibility at all to cover it up.

53
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.300
Then where would the gold be hidden?

No. She has been super good to me these couple of days.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.370
In fact, in her heart, she is what is called a richly colorful person.

83
00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.410
The other day, she told Qingchen a story.

84

 What?

An unfulfilled love between a person and a spirit.

A corpse was stolen from an old tomb? What was it that was stolen?

A dying person put their treasure into his own grave.

Tan Lingyin has already gone into the fortified village.

99

She asked Duan Feng to go down the mountain to lead the way.

Everything is going according to the plan.

Xiang Gua, you have to watch them carefully.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.810

I will kill her for you.

Yes.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.620

119
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.160
it should be here.

120
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.900
Why?

121
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.250
The fierce tiger hisses at the moon. The lotus flower appears out of the water.

122
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.870
If it was me, I would bury it here too.

123
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.580
Can you not curse yourself like this?

124
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.480
If you don't understand this then how are you the Magistrate?

125
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.130
The shape of this mountain top is like the head of a fierce tiger.

126
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.160
At night, the moon shines on the mountain top.

127
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.690
So it is the fierce tiger hissing at the moon.

128
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.470
The grave is surrounded by mountains and rivers.

129
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.960
And it's shaped like a lotus. So it's called the lotus flower appears out of the water.

130
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.330
Okay, Duan Feng.

131
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.430
Are you sure it's there?

132
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.170
Not 100% sure.

133
00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:48.490
Sang Jie, this old man is very vain. And he's extremely superstitious.

134
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.250
He must have picked the best place for the grave.

135
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:57.400
This place is at most good enough for a wealthy merchant.

136
00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.970
So you mean?

137
00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:07.240
Water and fire are separated.

138
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.370
It just passes as a place with good feng shui.

139
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.180
But the gorge under the hill runs through the water source.

140
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.250
Plus, the terrain is very precipitous.

141
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.710
From the perspective of the terrain, this is the best place to hide something.

142
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.290
I understand what you guys mean.

143
00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.870
In this case, the terrain and feng shui here is the best.

144
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.510
It may possibly be where the gold is buried.

145
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.970
Can you put away your lousy ruler?

146
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.440
Take it easy. The skills passed down from our ancestors

147
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.070
Must have something incredible about them.

148
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.360
The place we are looking for is probably around here.

149
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.700
We have been looking for more than half the day.

150
00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:53.890
It's possible-

151
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.070
We found the wrong place.

152
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:57.160
It's a ghost hitting the wall. (TN: a superstition that a ghost is causing humans to get lost at night.)

153
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.080
Come on, you're an Advisor. Can you not be so superstitious all the time?

154
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.070
But what if.

155
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.600
There's no what ifs. The person you should trust is me.

156
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.000
And not that.

157
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.170
So could you please tell us, our wise Master Tang.

158
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:14.000
Where is the entrance?

159
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.630
Hurry and go see what that is.

160
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.310
Sangjie's grave!

161
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.140
Is it? It was here.

162
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.020
Let's check it out and see if there's any traps.

163
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.640
Stop!

164
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.050
Sir.

165
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.380
Don't move.

166
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.040
Don't hide. Come on out.

167
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.760
Jiang Muchun? It's you.

168
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.480
Thank you to you two for leading the way.

169
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.520
You already paid Lao Tie,

170
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.950
to betray Sang Jie. You abandoned Zong Yinglin as well, right?

171
00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:51.520
Don't talk anymore.

172
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.270
You two are not as useful as Xiang Gua.

173
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.150
Watch for people out there.

174
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.730
Yes!

175
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.410
Go.

176
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.250
Jiang Muchun, stop.

177
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.340
You hit me. 
 I have wanted to hit you earlier.

178
00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.650
Tang Tianyuan.

179
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:48.620
I was the one that gave you everything and treated you like a god.

180
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.310
But you let me have a taste of what's it's like when the sky falls apart.

181
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.480
Without her

182
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.860
will you be able to see me?

183
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.540
Jiang Muchun, you finally revealed your true self.

184
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.270
You must be tired from acting this whole time.

185
00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.790
That's right. I have to see

186
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.520
How long are you going to stay like that?

187
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.560
What are you doing to do?

188
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.260
Jiang Muchun. Don't hurt Tang Linyi.

189
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.080
Master. 
 Let her go!

190
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.240
Master!

191
00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.530
Master.

192
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.110
-Lingyin.
-Sir!

193
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.580
Jiang Muchun, you better listen. If you have any grudges,
do it to me instead.

194
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.720
If you dare touch her, I will take your life.

195
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.260
Jiang Muchun, what are you doing?

196
00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:15.740
You don't need to take everything so seriously. Spare people when you can. Don't you know this?

197
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.560
Advisor, be careful!

198
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:24.440
Xiangguo!

199
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.460
What?

200
00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.290
Xianggua.

201
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.170
Xianggua.

202
00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:38.800
Xiang Gua, why are you doing this-

203
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.850
Why are you not stopping?

204
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.840
Xianggua.

205
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.560
Xianggua.

206
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:53.960
Master.

207
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.500
I actually didn't really him.

208
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:04.590
-Stop talking.
-Hurry and bring Xiang Gua back.

209
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:07.410
Be careful.

210
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.590
Jiang Muchun.

211
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.700
I'll make you pay 1000 times more than what you did to Xiang Gua.

212
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.460
I don't care. Ever since I started loving Tang Tianyuan,

213
00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:18.090
I have experienced so much torture and pain.

214
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.580
I have experienced what hurt the most in the world.
Why should I be afraid?

215
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.100
It's because of you. Xiang Gua was suppose to hurt you.

216
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.310
How come you are so stupid?

217
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.550
Stupid? You are the stupid one.

218
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.380
You don't know why Head Constable Zheng is here?

219
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.320
Xianggua knew your plan.

220
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:43.370
<i>Sir, Advisor, it was Miss Jiang. Miss Jiang wanted to use me.<i></i></i>

221
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.610
<i>She tried to make me tell her where the gold is.<i></i></i>

222
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:49.600
<i> Miss Jiang is a deep schemer.</i>

223
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.320
<i> I could only believe her.</i>

224
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.790
<i> You did a good thing.</i>

225
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.470
<i> Right, master. Jiang sister has been hiding</i>

226
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.880
<i> A key that is made from gold. </i>

227
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.500
<i> The key is extremely delicate.</i>

228
00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.760
<i>Go tell Jiang Muchun that we found the location of the gold.<i></i></i>

229
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.250
<i> Okay.</i>

230
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:11.680
Cong Shun, watch her.

231
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.210
Yes.

232
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.030
Master.

233
00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.600
Xianggua got hurt. It's all her fault.

234
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.890
I was going to wait, but I didn't know she was going to make a move this quick.

235
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.260
Cong Shun, carefully watch her.

236
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.650
-Yes.
-Let's go first.

237
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.150
This way.

238
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:47.570
Miss Jiang.

239
00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:52.120
Wait.

240
00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.280
What's wrong?

241
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.830
Yeah?

242
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:15.770
Making a fuss about nothing.

243
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:33.790
Now do you believe me?

244
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:37.560
Please Head Constable Zheng.

245
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.560
What! We are brothers, you can't harm me.

246
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.530
Sang Jie hid the gold here.

247
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.100
Because he hoped he could spend this gold one day.

248
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.440
So there's no way his traps are impossible to break.

249
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.250
Hurry and come.

250
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.390
I think it should be fine.

251
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:21.980
Let's go.

252
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.760
Look.

253
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:47.380
Sang Jie is just a mere County Magistrate.

254
00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:51.010
This scale. It's comparable to His Royal Highness.

255
00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:53.950
Shaofeng, open the lid.

256
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.700
No you can't. I heard that

257
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.810
you have to light a candle before removing the lid.

258
00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:06.940
We won't be able to do anything if the candle goes out. We can only go back.

259
00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.350
Okay, okay. I'll go.

260
00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:41.190
There isn't anything. Where's advisor?

261
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.260
Xiao Feilong, look quickly.

262
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.250
Oh no. 
 Don't leave.

263
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.710
Lingyin.

264
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.380
Sir! I'm held hostage again.

265
00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.010
Lord Tang, you thought the plan was really good.

266
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.300
But till now you are still not clear.

267
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.890
Who is the mantis, and who is the siskin (<i>a type of bird</i>).

268
00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.520
You bribed Cong Shun?

269
00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.710
She didn't need to bribe me.

270
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:31.860
We captured you two today to get revenge.

271
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.470
Adoptive father? Who is he?

272
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.420
Why is your memory so bad, Advisor Tan?

273
00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:43.330
You don't remember the person you personally killed?

274
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.730
Ruyi and I from a young age had no parents.

275
00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.800
We owe everything to him.

276
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:57.680
His daughter didn't amount to much. But he has me to avenge him.

277
00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.710
Calm down.

278
00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:02.760
It's Zong Yinglin.

279
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.110
We didn't kill Zong Yilin.

280
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.240
Why are you still lying?

281
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:11.900
All of you wanted him to die.

282
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:14.830
Only you guys hate the very existence of my father.

283
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.930
Jiang sister told me.

284
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.780
The assassin that killed my father was sent by you two.

285
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.430
And the evidence is clear. Zheng Shaofeng's jade pendant was found at the scene.

286
00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.060
Cong Shun, why do you believe everything she says?

287
00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.490
-What can a jade pendant prove? 
-Cong Shun.

288
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.890
Even though it can't prove anything.What about Zhou Ruyi?

289
00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:38.400
Zhou Ruyi and Zheng Shaofeng fell in love with each other long ago.

290
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.360
She worked with them long time ago and betrayed Lord Zong.

291
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.860
You saw all of these with your own eyes.

292
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.720
Master Zong asked for mercy repeatedly. But she refused time and time again.

293
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.240
These truths defeat any arguments.

294
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.190
You already know what to do, I don't need to say it.

295
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:57.440
You dare touch her.

296
00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.450
Guess if I do. Go back.

297
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.810
Master Tang, I know you're actually the main culprit.

298
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.790
If you kill yourself I will let Advisor Tan go.

299
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.820
If you want to live, that's okay.

300
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.050
Then you can only watch Advisor Tan being beheaded.

301
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.820
Master. Don't listen to him.

302
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:24.480
Okay.

303
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.930
Give me the knife.

304
00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.560
Cong Shun, are you stupid?

305
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.970
When Zong Yinglin died, Sir was still sick.

306
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.230
How is it possible that he killed him?

307
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.820
Zong Yinglin wanting to defect to us is such a good thing for us.

308
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.830
Why should I kill him?

309
00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.280
You.

310
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.930
It was you.

311
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.590
Cong Shun!

312
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.090
Cong Shun, are you okay?

313
00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.690
How are you?

314
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.320
Cong Shun!

315
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.300
Goodbye, you don't have much time left.

316
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.460
Advisor.

317
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.010
Don't say.

318
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.420
Let's go.

319
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:36.710
Hurry.

320
00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.390
I don't need to do anything.

321
00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:57.120
Unfortunately the Broken Dragon stone has fallen.

322
00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.860
You all won't be able to go back.

323
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:12.540
I will come and bury your bodies after seven days.

324
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:16.640
Then at that time, you will be mine.

325
00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.590
The gold will also be mine.

326
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.060
What was that sound?

327
00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:32.510
Jiang Muchun activated the trap and released the Broken Dragon Stone.

328
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:36.040
Broken Dragon Stone?

329
00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:40.970
They all say this stone cuts off yin and yang and separates life and death.

330
00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.430
Then air won't even be able to come in.

331
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.470
We are screwed.

332
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.620
Master. Will we really die here?

333
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.520
Didn't you ask a fortune teller about me? I'm destined for glory and wealth.

334
00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:01.160
And I'll marry a wife that will bring me good fortune and have lots of children and grandchildren.

335
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.830
That was all to trick you.

336
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.330
I don't believe it.

337
00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.960
Then I'll go find another exit.

338
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.330
Lingyin, if you didn't come to Tongling.

339
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.980
If you didn't knock on the door of the County Office.

340
00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.880
If you didn't become my advisor,

341
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.550
you wouldn't be involved in all of this and have you life at risk.

342
00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.050
Do you regret it?

343
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.340
I don't regret it.

344
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.150
What I regret is saying all those bad stuff to you.

345
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:46.960
Who cares about the novels?

346
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:50.300
As long we're together, I'm going with not writing.

347
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:58.930
Then if this time we leave alive

348
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.080
marry me okay?

349
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.310
Then can I still write books?

350
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:06.920
Yeah.

351
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.570
Then let's get married.

352
00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:17.930
Sister.

353
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.120
Xingchen? 
 Are you okay?

354
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.060
Xingchen.

355
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.230
You guys sure are high-spirited for people who are about to  die.

356
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.640
You came too slow.

357
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.290
The tomb robbers didn't do a good job.

358
00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:32.500
We only needed a hole three feet away from the tomb

359
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.460
and it took us this long to get here.

360
00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.900
You knew that Duanfeng was gonna come?

361
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.960
Where else would this guy go?

362
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.590
Thankfully he was smart enough to not confront Jiang Muchun.

363
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:50.580
Of course! I'm flexible and adaptive.

364
00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:54.850
Then why did you act like we were about to die before?

365
00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.950
Tricker.

366
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.260
You agreed anyway.

367
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.430
Thanks.

368
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.520
What is there to thanks?

369
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.390
Since we're good brothers.

370
00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.660
As long as you need it, I'll come.

371
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.270
It's not the time to relax.

372
00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.400
Jiang Muchun is probably destroying evidence right now at the county office.

373
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:23.860
-Come and bring water. 
-Here!

374
00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.210
-Get water! 
-It's not enough!

375
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:28.720
Someone come help!

376
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.780
-Hurry.
-Hurry.

377
00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.630
-Hurry!

378
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.680
Get water!

379
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.310
<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

380
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.710
Get more water!

381
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.060
Over here, over here.

382
00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.260
-Hurry and put out the fire.
-How did this happen?

383
00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.970
I'll go look.

384
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.290
-Hurry! 
-I'm coming!

385
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.540
-Sir.
-Sir.

386
00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:55.560
There's nothing flammable on the ground here. Why would it catch on fire? Something's fishy.

387
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.610
We also don't know. 
We don't know.

388
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:00.420
Something flammable?

389
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.630
Some time ago Jiang Muchun made me buy a bunch of white phosphorus.

390
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.860
This must be caused by white phosphorus!

391
00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.140
Why didn't you say earlier?

392
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:10.930
I-I just realized.

393
00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:12.550
You!

394
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:14.350
-Hurry.

395
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.220
Advisor!

396
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.470
It's on fire over here too!

397
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.180
Go. 
 Yes.

398
00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.310
Head constable Zheng, there's no one inside.

399
00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.100
That toxic woman. Did she grow wings and fly away?

400
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.250
-Don't let anyone get by, go look.
-Yes.

401
00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:44.770
-Have you seen the advisor?
-No, Sir.

402
00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:50.170
Master.

403
00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.940
Jiang Muchun. 
 Don't move.

404
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.060
You toxic woman. You don't have anywhere to run.  Let her go.

405
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:04.000
In all my calculations, I never ever thought that

406
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.490
I still couldn't beat the heavens.

407
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.020
The heavens allow you to live and come back.

408
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:13.690
-It was you who saved her.
-That's right.

409
00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:17.670
Put the knife down. We can talk.

410
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:19.730
Talk?

411
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.780
Jiang Muchun, it's not too late to repent.

412
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.570
There is no more time.

413
00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.840
I can't talk.

414
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.310
Ever since Lord Tang,

415
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.420
You gave up on me.

416
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:41.250
I already decided

417
00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.500
I have to get the gold for my dad.

418
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.670
How can the situation still be changed?

419
00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:52.370
My younger brother didn't have the gold.

420
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.860
No way.

421
00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.560
No way!

422
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:04.160
If there was gold, why would we come back empty handed?

423
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.910
- Where is Old Tie? Where is he? 
- Did you really think you could bribe Old Tie

424
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.470
And kill all of us so that you could get the gold?

425
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:15.990
He thought that too.

426
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:19.040
He didn't even plan to share half with you.

427
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.220
What he wanted, was for you to die in Tongling.

428
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.650
Your father is already a dead man walking now.

429
00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.920
And you planned all of this on his behalf.

430
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.400
Do you want to fulfil his wishes?

431
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.940
From the day my brother died

432
00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.380
my dad's heart died too.

433
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.980
Do you think it's funny?

434
00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.950
He put all the hope on someone else.

435
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.320
Then what about me?

436
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:06.790
What about me?

437
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.800
Why can't he see me?

438
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.620
Does he think that because Jiang Rendong died,

439
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.090
the Jiang family over too?

440
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:19.580
Your father's embezzlement is already a serious crime.

441
00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.220
Yet you did no persuade him to admit to his crimes.

442
00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.790
But took it one step further by planning all this on his behalf.

443
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:28.350
Naturally you should be killed.

444
00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:30.940
But I'll give you one more chance

445
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.930
Put the knife down.

446
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:35.310
We can still talk.

447
00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.630
Talk about what?

448
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.590
I have already killed so many people. What is there to talk about?

449
00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.100
There was no time to go back in the beginning.

450
00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.270
Lingyin.

451
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.900
Look at the time.

452
00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.230
How scary.

453
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.580
Let's die together.

454
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.900
Sir, hurry and chase her.

455
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:31.980
There's no need. We're good friends.

456
00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:39.050
Take her away.

457
00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:49.010
Lingyin, I want to say something to you.

458
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.500
Good things do not last for long on this earth.

459
00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.230
Even if you use your whole life

460
00:33:58.850 --> 00:34:01.380
to cherish a love,

461
00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.760
it will be the same as coloured glass.

462
00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.580
Once touched, it breaks.

463
00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.650
Go!

464
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.580
This toxic woman. She's knows how to confuse and poison minds.

465
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.790
Sis, don't listen to her.

466
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.690
I think what she said made sense.

467
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:27.290
Lingyin, about you  join me in looting and plundering.

468
00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.810
We can live freely and become a pair of runaway mandarin ducks. (TN: mandarin ducks symbolize affectionate lovers)

469
00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.540
It's fine.

470
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:41.300
Are you hurt?

471
00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.560
Don't come over.

472
00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.100
Just then

473
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:23.480
it was you who helped us earlier.

474
00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.970
Saving Advisor Tan was also you.

475
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.190
You were always by my side.

476
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.660
Since you don't want to leave

477
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.800
then stay here. Okay?

478
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.330
A good person needs to experience a lot of suffering to become a Buddha.

479
00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.230
Why does a bad person only need to put down their knife to become a good person.

480
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.570
Thank you for forgiving me.

481
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:55.030
But I need time to let go of myself.

482
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.190
Okay.

483
00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.940
I'll wait for you.

484
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.740
I'll always

485
00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.370

490
00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:51.200
<i> ♫ The overnight spring breeze, as I go out into the world, hoping not to disappoint ♫</i>

491
00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:57.310
<i> ♫ To roam the world, just this ferry of longing, I can't let go ♫</i>

<i> ♫ A fierce horse, where is it going in this mortal world? ♫</i>

495
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:17.200
<i> ♫ Where can I leisurely see to the limit of the cloud and stars ♫</i>

496
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.380
<i> ♫ On an ancient road, as the sun sets, I asked the young bamboo ♫</i>

497
00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.330
<i> ♫ When will you reply? ♫</i>

502
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:45.580
<i> ♫ A good dream, a youth’s travels ♫</i>

508
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:21.460

511
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:35.690
<i> ♫ A stream of west wind, welcomes Tusu (wine), in pursuit ♫</i>

512
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:41.110
