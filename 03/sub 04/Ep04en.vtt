8
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.670
Hold on.

9
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.320
Until when are you going to be like this? Did you get caught doing something?

10
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.550
Don't look at her.

11
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.910
The look in her eyes says she's planning something crazy. If you acknowledge her, you're done for.

12
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.040
What? Why... Why are we done for?

13
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.790
You're never safe around Jang Hari.

14
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.890
- But... I didn't do anything wrong. 
 - I'm a bit scared.

15
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.820
Then since you think you're safe, why don't you deal with her?

16
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.060
Do I have to prepare myself?

17
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.040
Before she talks to me, I'll be going.

18
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.860
Okay, we'll start now.

19
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.610
Okay, release your tension, lower your shoulder, tuck in your chin, and look at the camera lens.

20
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.520
1, 2, 3... All right, good.

21
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.160
<i>Yoon Jaeyoung. His words may be blunt, but his personality's not all bad.</i>

22
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.070
<i>If the baby takes after him, it'll be smart.</i>

23
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.480
<i>No. There's something really annoying about him.</i>

24
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.860
<i>Han Yisang.</i>

25
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.710
<i>His personality seems to be bad but weirdly also good.</i>

26
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.420
<i>His curiosity and his mind to take on challenges are good.</i>

27
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.920
<i>No... I can't talk to him.</i>

28
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.050
<i>Choikang Eutteum.</i>

29
00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.280
<i>What is he like?</i>

30
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.120
Great work!

31
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.620
- You worked hard! 
 - You worked hard! Thank you!

32
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.250
You worked hard.

33
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.130
Wait.

34
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.540
- Eutteum. 
 - Yes?

35
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.010
Where are you all going together?

36
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.770
I need to hurry and look after Doha. Aunt must be having a hard time.

37
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.520
I need to quickly report to Manager Kim that it ended well.

38
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.560
I need to eat lunch and go to a photoshoot. Do you have something to say to me?

39
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280
That lunch... I'll buy it.

40
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.040
That turned out well! You guys can eat together. Eat deliciously!

41
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.790
Where are you going?

42
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.610
Mom doesn't have a schedule in the afternoon.

43
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.050
What's wrong with you? How could you let her take care of the baby all day? It's hard on Aunt.

44
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.190
Mom is having a hard time, but does she have to concern herself over your lunch, too? Eat and then go home.

45
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.310
Yeah, you should. You three can chat and have a good time.

46
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.710
You should come, too.

47
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.350
Manager Kim is working outside right now.

48
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.440
He has probably come back already.

49
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.310
I heard him loudly say this morning that he had a lunch appointment with a client.

50
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.600
<i>Mr. Eutteum, I have a lunch appointment with a client. I'll be back late.</i>

51
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.720
<i>Yes, yes. Yes?</i>

52
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.440
<i>I AM COMING BACK AFTER EATING LUNCH. EAT. LUNCH.</i>

53
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.330
<i>LATE.</i>

54
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.870
Let's go.

55
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.270
Brace yourselves. All right, let's go.

56
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.120
What are you doing? Picking a husband?

57
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.440
Let's see. I pick...

58
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.150
I'll text you. Fighting!

59
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.260
Why is nobody sitting beside me?

60
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.610
We're comfortable like this right now. Why did you want to suddenly eat with us?

61
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.280
Just because. We should get closer.

62
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.860
The three of you were put together suddenly, so I think we should get to know each other better.

63
00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.510
I got scared for no reason. We're all scared of you. Isn't that fascinating?

64
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.000
- This one's pretty fearless. 
 - It's because he's young. He doesn't know what's coming.

65
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.580
- Am I scary? 
 - Look at your eyes. They are so scary right now.

66
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.650
Well...

67
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.700
Since I've aged, I've realized how precious friends are.

68
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.960
We should meet like this often, become friendly, and take care of each other's health.

69
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.110
With that said, Mr. Eutteum?

70
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.920
- Yes? 
 - You look really healthy. Your household must have a healthy constitution.

71
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.160
There's no family history of diseases, right?

72
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.110
- There isn't anybody sick in my household. 
 - Oh really?

73
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.280
Meanwhile, my body's not what it used to be. They say your body starts to deteriorate the minute you turn 40.

74
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.290
Maybe that's what's happening to me. I ache here and there, right?

75
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:46.870
- I'm not hurting here or there. 
 - No chronic diseases?

76
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.050
- There's no way. 
 - I see. That's nice.

77
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.150
We are at the age where we need to be sensitive about our health.

78
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.480
If we drink alcohol, we wake up the night after. If we pull an all-nighter, we sleep for two days.

79
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.400
So before we develop a serious disease, we should diligently check our health twice a day.

80
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.020
As a doctor, I can tell you have a liver problem.

81
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.070
But you can't have mine. It's hardened from all the alcohol.

82
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.830
You're eliminated.

83
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.380
You guys are like real siblings. When did you become friends?

84
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.810
Unfortunately, since we were in the womb, our mothers were friends.

85
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.290
No wonder. You two are like elementary children.

86
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.670
Your manners are proper. You smile while dissing at our first meeting.

87
00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.510
Weren't you guys cousins? Aunt's daughter?

88
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.840
You thought we were cousins, huh? We're friends. Boyfriend.

89
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.040
Boyfriend? He's your boyfriend?

90
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.390
Boy friend. Say it correctly.

91
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.460
Why do you live together if you are friends?

92
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.680
- Ah, he's leeching off our house— 
 - Can't we live together?

93
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.310
We're...

94
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.880
in that type of relationship.

95
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.990
The relationship where you're going to get hit!

96
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.410
Since we've talked like this, it's nice to get to know each other.

97
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.280
Let's... slowly and deeply learn about each other.

98
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.500
- Yes, that sounds good. Cheers! 
 - Cheers!

99
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.510
- Cheers! 
 - Here you go.

100
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:30.130
<i>[Episode 4: The Time Needed to Understand One Another]</i>

101
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.710
Stand right there!

102
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.150
Follow me.

103
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.370
You're not coming?

104
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.100
I'm sorry, I did something that would get cursed at.

105
00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:54.140
- You didn't know you were going to get cursed at? 
 - I didn't know I'd get caught.

106
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:57.500
I know it's an action that will get cursed at.

107
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.440
But to be honest, I'm not sure if it's such a bad thing.

108
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.320
Why should a person's marital status determine ethics?

109
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:11.680
Am I supposed to debate with you right now? For a married couple,

110
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.750
it's easy to understand that they want a child.

111
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.720
Doing something that most people wouldn't accept is just crazy.

112
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.610
Then, do I become a crazy lady?

113
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.470
Don't be shocked. I never thought you were normal.

114
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.700
That's reassuring.

115
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.970
If you've already decided to, go and cause a big accident.

116
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.320
You're on my side?

117
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.090
No. Let's just say I understand that you're desperate.

118
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.330
Just make sure you deal with the aftermath yourself.

119
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.560
There's no way I would need to take responsibility, right? Who, besides us, recognized me?

120
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.920
Exactly. We all recognized you.

121
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.870
- That's her, right? 
 - Yeah.

122
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.960
So work relationships are meaningless in front of gossip.

123
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.460
Please drink deliciously.

124
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:28.790
Is it true?

125
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:32.080
- What is? 
 - I heard it's not your first time.

126
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.840
I heard that's how you got your first child.

127
00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.090
- Is it a son or a daughter? 
 - They say a daughter!

128
00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.200
- Who does she look like? 
 - They say exactly like you!

129
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.710
- She must be pretty. 
 - No, no.

130
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:45.130
There wasn't anything about her being pretty.

131
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:51.290
Well, I hope that the daughter who I didn't know I had will grow up well.

132
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:57.120
Does the conversation end with you abandoning your child?

133
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.170
Gosh!

134
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.600
It's not the time for her to be so calm.

135
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.150
<i>What if I don't marry?</i>

136
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.390
<i>What if I don't have you either?</i>

137
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.010
<i>Do I just live for myself?</i>

138
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.680
<i>You said you lived for me.</i>

139
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:28.510
<i>Without a family, do I just take care of myself, live well by myself, and die?</i>

140
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.780
How are you going to live being so lonely?

141
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.050
There are all sorts of sadness when you grow old.

142
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:42.030
Having nobody beside you.

143
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.960
Who's going to look after you when you're sick?

144
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.930
Are you going to drink?

145
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.410
- You shouldn't. 
 - Hush! Come here.

146
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.810
Jaeyoung,

147
00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.720
what do you think of Hari?

148
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.050
Mom. Can I call you mom?

149
00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.100
You seem like my biological mom to me lately.

150
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.070
What is it now? Hari and I have been friends since birth. We're practically family...

151
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.850
That's why I'm saying let's officially become a family!

152
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.190
Why don't you see Hari as a woman?

153
00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.610
She's pretty, kind, funny,

154
00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.500
is full of charms. There's no way you can't fall for her.

155
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.640
I know.

156
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.630
Why wouldn't I know that she's a fine woman?

157
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.080
That's why I can't.

158
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:56.200
Why would you put a divorced man with a baby with her?

159
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:02.520
Instead of me, she should meet a good man.

160
00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.120
She should.

161
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.770
Ow, ow! It hurts!

162
00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.660
Do I seem like an old man?

163
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.190
<i>Here. Let's go.</i>

164
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.180
<i>We live together.</i>

165
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.060
<i>Why do you live together if you're friends?</i>

166
00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.160
<i>Ah, he leeches off our house—</i>

167
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.490
<i>Can't we live together?</i>

168
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:10.060
<i>We're... in that type of relationship.</i>

169
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.590
Hey, do you think that makes sense?

170
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:24.540
How could a grown man and woman

171
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.610
live together in one house?

172
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:28.500
Answer me.

173
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:31.160
You brat, why can't you talk?

174
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.510
Never mind, let's stop talking.

175
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.530
You've gotten old.

176
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.290
Why did you prepare so much?

177
00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.870
I'll eat well.

178
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.850
Wow, it smells nice.

179
00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.970
Do you want soup?

180
00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.320
It looks tasty.

181
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:18.340
It's not that I won't marry even if I die,

182
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.120
it's just so hard to realistically meet a man.

183
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.200
There are no fine men around me.

184
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:28.490
And I, more than marriage, pregnancy is more—

185
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.310
M-Mom, I...

186
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:41.390
Why do you have no sense?

187
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.990
<i>You need to eat your soup with rice. Why are you eating away your sense?</i>

188
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.180
<i>Granny was already upset enough as it is.</i>

189
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.760
<i>If you put it like that, do you think she would get more or less angry?</i>

190
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.890
<i>Let's grasp the situation here, Mom.</i>

191
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.380
You're not it.

192
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.290
What's not it?

193
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.330
No.

194
00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.100
What's not it?

195
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.580
Eat your food.

196
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.610
I must eat a lot.

197
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.380
Okay, could we get the kids to stand in the front?

198
00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:40.870
Yes, let's gather!

199
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:43.840
Kids, look here!

200
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.180
Yay! Wow! That looks great.

201
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:49.950
You really found great models. The vibe they're giving off is great.

202
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.880
Let's just add a bit of lies and say they're a family of math geniuses,

203
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.910
financial geniuses, and art geniuses.

204
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.630
He looks fine.

205
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.540
You're handsome, huh? His nose is tall.

206
00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:13.010
His jawline is sharp too, and his skin is so pale.

207
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.120
Isn't he friends with Jang Hari?

208
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.280
Yes. They have been friends since they were babies.

209
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.530
They had to separate when he got married, but recently, they've gotten friendly again.

210
00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.860
He was married?

211
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.690
He said he loved his wife so much that he didn't want to see her at all.

212
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.450
This guy is divorced, has a baby, and moved into her house.

213
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:39.630
He has a baby?

214
00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:43.150
Exactly. He has a baby.

215
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.430
He's perfect for her.

216
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:50.180
He's a doctor, there's nothing they don't know about each other, and he even has a baby.

217
00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.940
He's dangerous.

218
00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.360
What?

219
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.030
He has the face of a scammer.

220
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:03.710
Why are you jealous? You got caught!

221
00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:32.190
When you feel anxious, you're likely to make the wrong move.

222
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:41.260
I'm saying this because you might meet any man saying you're lonely.

223
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.180
Why?

224
00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:47.720
Do you think that I would just fall for any guy and suffer because I get stuck with a rude one?

225
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.690
No. It's because you look very rushed to get married and have kids.

226
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.130
Cause an accident only with me.

227
00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.420
Whether I meet a trashy man or not, don't mind me.

228
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.690
Why would you meet a trashy man?

229
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.100
Are you the type that can't tell the difference between good and bad when you fall in love?

230
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.950
Yes. I can't differentiate that. I only know love.

231
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:16.180
But don't worry too much, because once I feel someone's not right for me, he'll never be right.

232
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.360
- Oh goodness! 
 - What?

233
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.580
It's hard to converse. Has my blood level dropped?

234
00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.970
I must go get my blood sugar level fixed.

235
00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.350
Why is he being like that?

236
00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.140
Can you try a kihap?
 <i>(T/N: Shouting in taekwondo.)</i>

237
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.750
Kihap!

238
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.350
Looks good. Nice!

239
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.840
<i>Hold on.</i>

240
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.300
<i>Mom, it's tiring because I'm hungry.</i>

241
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.650
<i>Can't I do it after eating a hot dog?</i>

242
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:03.030
So burdensome.

243
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:19.420
<i>Next Wednesday is Father's memorial day. You should come. Mom is waiting for you.</i>

244
00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.320
Oh my, is it Paris this time?

245
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.850
You're traveling the world, thanks to Brother-in-Law.

246
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:54.070
Hey, hey! Wait.

247
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:59.560
Your father always asked for water before he ate his meals.

248
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.580
- Hey, try eating some of this. 
 - Mother, you should eat, too.

249
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.620
Eat up.

250
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:19.120
By the way, aren't you going to invite us over to your new house?

251
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.720
- I'll set a date just for the adults to come. 
 - Huh?

252
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.250
Brother-in-Law, our kids are calm.

253
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:27.320
I have a moái at home.

254
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.990
What? A kid?
<i> (T/N: Moái sounds like "child")</i>

255
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.520
Are you... living with her?

256
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.990
Mother-in-Law, it's a coal statue. A rock.

257
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.970
Why are you living with a rock?

258
00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.060
I bought it recently.

259
00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.660
I've been wanting one for a while.

260
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.350
They say you can't get married if you give your affection to things like figures or animals.

261
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.820
No, that won't do.

262
00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:03.760
Do you want to try meeting the chief at my company? She's called the Golden Miss.

263
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.910
I think it's about time you started meeting other people.

264
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:14.070
No, thank you. I'm quite shy.

265
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.850
Do you know that Mom can't even sleep properly because she's so worried about you?

266
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:26.910
Until when are you going to keep acting up like this, as if you've reaped all the benefits of this world yourself?

267
00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.720
Hey, hey! Cut it out!

268
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.390
I'll head out first.

269
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.030
Hey! You were in the middle of— Hey!

270
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.300
Honey.

271
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.990
Goodness, that punk!

272
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.520
Uncle, are you not getting married to Inha?

273
00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.850
Byul, do you still remember Inha?

274
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:54.420
Inha bought me the Elsa dress.

275
00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:59.510
Oh my. Wow, our Byul is so smart.

276
00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.630
Wow, you must be happy that Byul is so smart.

277
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.630
I went to go see Cinderella with Big Sister Inha, too!

278
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:08.060
Han Byul, be quiet!

279
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.340
Uncle's marriage has been ruined. Inha ran away.

280
00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.180
Inha is banned, you poop idiot!

281
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.200
Mom, Brother called me a poop idiot!

282
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.570
It's okay.

283
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.310
Why are you calling your younger sister a poop idiot? You're going to get in trouble!

284
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.200
What did I do wrong?

285
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.480
Goodness, it's so loud! Stop fussing!

286
00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:37.760
<i>[Dachae Media]</i>

287
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.440
Hello. You said you needed someone strong, so I came.

288
00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.920
We need to get the gift bags for "The Mom" launch ceremony from storage.

289
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.920
You probably won't be able to get all of it in one go.

290
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.260
Choi Hyojoo, where are you going?

291
00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.720
Yes? Ah, I have a meeting. I'll be back.

292
00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.420
No. You don't have a meeting.

293
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.490
I mean... the—

294
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.380
They're gathering the presents outside, so don't forget any and bring them all in.

295
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.260
Don't make three trips when you could've made two.

296
00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.690
Oh, and bring two more bundles of magazines as well.

297
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.450
What?

298
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.500
Your cart.

299
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.190
You should push it in front of you, like me! This is more convenient.

300
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:26.390
Forget it!

301
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.940
If it were up to me, I would push the cart for you.

302
00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.430
However, I heard that to contemporary women, it's not considered good manners,

303
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.800
but overstepping my boundaries.

304
00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.860
Who said such things?

305
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.860
My mom. She's a feminist.

306
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.120
She says that I shouldn't treat women as weak people who can't even lift their own bags.

307
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:47.560
Never, ever.

308
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.900
I think she just said that because she hated seeing her son carrying his girlfriend's bags.

309
00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.200
I'm okay, so you should drag this in my stead.

310
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.040
Excuse me.

311

I'll see you next time.

312
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.960
Yes, I'll contact you. Take care.

313

Did you have a meeting?

314

We just picked an infertile couple. Are you going to the storage?

315

Yes.

316
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.160
Are you going to die?

317
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.060
Yes. It looks like my clothes are about to die.

318
00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:26.380
It's seen the light for the first time today.

319

That's true, your clothes are bit vibrant for the stor—

320

Okay. See you!

324

So annoying.

325
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.720
Director, should I take these out, too?

326
00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.550
Be careful!

327
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.970
Don't worry. I'm used to this much, because I've worked part-time at a warehouse before.

328
00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.330
A warehouse? I thought you were the type to have been raised softly in your mother's embrace.

329
00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.810
I did it as I was applying for jobs. Now I'm glad I did, it's useful for this.

330
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:11.980
What should I do with this?

331
00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.180
Let's just take down two bundles.

332
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.130
Right.

The younger you are, the better your chances of reproducing.

334

What?

335
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.480
Huh?

336
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.490
Right.

337

The younger you are, the better your chances of reproducing.

- What? 
 - Huh?

339
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:13.330
Your ability to produce stamina! What I mean is that you have a lot of it.

340
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.940
I mean, since you're young, you're active

341
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.000
and you have a high rate of succeeding—

342
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.280
A high rate of succeeding?

343
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.080
So I mean you have a high rate of succeeding in society.

344
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.310
Since you're healthy.

345
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.370
Physically and mentally.

346
00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.150
Thank you, Boss.

347
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:39.690
Boss, is there anything more that I can help with?

348
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.820
I shall help you with everything with this healthy physicality.

349
00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.370

There's no reason not to.

354

That's true. There may be people who have not used you before, but there isn't anyone who's only used you once.

I'm not that old.

366

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:23.900
Right? Ouch.

470
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:35.110
When is tomorrow's photoshoot?

471
00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:40.710
It's just a simple sketch of the event. Do you hate this type of work?

472
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:45.750
It's not like I'll die from a simple event sketch. What's there to like or hate?

473
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:49.280
It's just that suddenly working with "the baby" again has me a bit flustered.

474
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.470
But why do you guys always need so many little favors?

475
00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.450
I hate when work relationships get blurry.

476
00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:02.200
Don't we have a close enough relationship to ask each other for little favors?

477
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.040
Are we close? I thought you didn't even want to look at me anymore.

478
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.440
That's really disheartening. Didn't you hold me when I cried that one night?

479
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.390
If we aren't close, then why did you hug me?

480
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:19.930
When did I hug you? I just patted your back like this.

481
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.760
Sure.

482
00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.650
The scary thing is, I went from hating you to liking you.

483
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:29.040
I guess I was the only one feeling closer.

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.900
Stop it already. The mic works fine.

490
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.390
Should I sing a song?

491
00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:08.180
Forget the song. Go make some calls instead. Hasn't it been over an hour already?

I'll take you to your seats. The others aren't here yet.

495
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.730
The other moms aren't coming.

We came as the representatives to relay the news.

497

You're her, aren't you? The one who tried to illegally buy sperm.

498
00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.190
How could a reporter for a baby magazine do such a thing? How unethical.

499
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.860
Right. We refuse to support a magazine with an unethical journalist.

500
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.630
I...

501
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:55.610
I thought moms would understand... my desire to become a mother.

502
00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.880
We're like this because we're moms. We want our children to be raised in an upright environment.

503
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.300
We understand that there are women who want to raise children without getting married, but

504
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.430
did you not think about the child who will grow up without a father?

505
00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:12.830
A child is not a toy. Fighting to raise a child just because you want to... is just a selfish desire.

506
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.340
If you think about the child, you wouldn't do such a thing.

507
00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.150
If you really want to raise something, get a dog or cat.

508
00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:24.980
Lady!

509
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.830
What do you mean "raise a dog"? Are you disregarding dog lovers?

510
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:30.900
Why are you stepping in?

511
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:33.300
No, I love dogs, so it made me mad!

512
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.890
Whether she raises a dog or a child, it's none of your business.

513
00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:40.970
Did Ms. Jang Hari do anything wrong? She didn't buy it.

514
00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.950
I apologize for making you all uncomfortable.

515
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.270
I understand your concerns.

516
00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.910
You have every right to say that as moms.

517
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:05.630
But... the situation was definitely not what you're thinking.

518
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.230
I've been working alongside moms for the last 15 years

519
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.310
so I thought I knew how moms would feel, but

520
00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:26.630
I guess... it's right that I was clueless.

521
00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.330
I want to learn more about how moms feel and I want to understand motherhood.

522
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.500
I truly hope I get the chance to be a mom.

523

<i>Did you finish it?</i>

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.400
Where's Deputy Editor Jang?

526
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.530
I sent her to organize the storage. We're about to leave for the day, so why don't you two talk tomorrow?

527
00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:02.240
Editor Shim, this isn't something you should defend her on.

528
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.010
Oh, I have the power to do that?

529
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:09.850
When she gets to work tomorrow, send her straight to my office.

530
00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.560
Do you understand?

531
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.990
Yes, Sir.

535
00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:13.120
People from work go there often.

536
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.600
Thank you.

537
00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:20.850
Why were you looking for me?

538
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:26.770
Are you worried I'd be crying like a child? So you can pat me on the back again?

539
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.460
I need a drinking buddy, that's why.

540
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.960
I have a lot on my mind today.

541
00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.410
Why did you lie?

542
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.020
You don't have a dog.

543
00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.300
How did you know?

544
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:55.250
You'd brag about it.

545
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:58.240
My Ddol Ddol was very clever.

546
00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.130
It never came back after running away 30 years ago though.

547
00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:18.910
Do you think the moms will understand me?

548
00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:28.000
My mom and dad always argued during meals.

549
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.670
My dad always had to drink a glass of water before his meal,

550
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:35.490
but my mom said it would hinder his digestion.

551
00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:40.600
<i>After my dad passed away, Mom would always put water with his ancestral rites.</i>

552
00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.070
<i>Even though, for 40 years during meals</i>

553
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.300
<i>she would always say how she couldn't understand him.</i>

554
00:42:52.690 --> 00:42:57.390
Misunderstanding must come first before understanding.

555
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.810
If you finally understand someone at one point,

556
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:10.640
then that means you've been thinking of that person the whole time.

557
00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:14.470
It's one person, who can't even understand himself,

558
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.430
that's trying to understand another.

559
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:23.120
And true understanding will change their attitude.

560
00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:26.640
Although it shouldn't take 40 years.

561
00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.110
Why did you come? I might need to be carried home today.

562
00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.900
My back is pretty wide. It'll be comfortable.

563
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.460
I don't know about that.

564
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:49.750
- How about a drink? 
 - Sure.

565
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:04.140
Chief was right. You're a good person.

566
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:07.020
What's good about me? Be more specific.

567
00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.920
Let's just say you're an average person.

568
00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.040
Mr. Average Person, are you going to stay single?

569
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:20.890
You seem like a good person,

570
00:44:20.890 --> 00:44:25.160
so I'm wondering if you'll stay single.

571
00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:27.230
I hate getting excited (about someone).

572
00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:35.640
Expecting someone, getting disappointed, getting hurt, and liking someone.

573
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.250
I can't handle having my heart race like that again.

574
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:44.000
If I fall in love again at this point, life may not be so kind.

575
00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.010
I want to live like how I am right now.

576
00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:54.590
Silently. Without anything happening.

577
00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:15.510
But...

578
00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:21.540
why do you want to become a mother?

579
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.850
Because...

580
00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.350
<i>I want to be happy.</i>

581
00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:53.060
You...

582
00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:58.260
are very hard working. You did some incredible PR work for the company.

583
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:02.550
I heard you completely flipped the mom community upside down.

584
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:04.540
She said she was working undercover.

585
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:08.820
To fix the situation, I think it would be best to release an article stating that.

586
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.880
- She told the readers she wants to have a baby! 
 - Yes, Sir.

587
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.770
If we're going to release a statement, we should at least get our stories straight.

588
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.380
Of course, we should.

589
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:23.110
- I'll take responsibility and fix— 
 - Stay out of it!

590
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:27.420
You don't even have kids, so you can't understand our readers. Even if you're qualified,

591
00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:32.240
I don't know if you can be a good editor-in-chief. All you do is cause trouble.

592
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.600
That's why I plan to have a baby—

593
00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:45.380
I knew you were a dimwit from the start, but I didn't think you'd be this bad.

594
00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.760
We're planning to hold a disciplinary hearing as soon as possible.

595
00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.860
It'll be our first hearing in 30 years, so it won't be easy.

596
00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.250
Considering the severity of the situation, we will be very stern.

597
00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:02.770
I'm sorry.

598
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:05.230
It was wrong to tarnish the company's image.

599
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:11.870
But technically, it's your personal life. It's not like they'll take care of your personal issues, those jerks.

600
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.090
Excuse me.

601
00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:18.430
Hello?

602
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:21.940
You're Lee Okran's guardian, right? I'm calling from Big Hospital.

603
00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.480
Why aren't you coming? Without a guardian, she can't leave.

604
00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:27.250
What?

605
00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.810
- Lee Okran's guardian? 
 - Yes?

606
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.810
The patient is still sleeping.

607
00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.460
Please sit here and once she comes out, we'll call you.

608
00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.260
Okay. Thank you.

609
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:52.860

625
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:12.600
<i>Does it hurt?</i>

626
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:22.410
<i>When did it become expected that I'd be the guardian of my mom?</i>

627
00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.780
<i>Lee Okran's guardian?</i>

628
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.550
Mom!

629
00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:35.040
Thank you.

630
00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.390
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

631
00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:47.140
<i>Like this, helplessly, the moment that comes when the child becomes the guardian of their parents.</i>

632
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.790
<i>That moment...</i>

633
00:49:54.380 --> 00:50:00.860
<i>We... have no choice but to become an adult.</i>

634
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.600
You guys must've gone somewhere nice.

635
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.660
I went alone because I thought I could like last time.

636
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.410
I didn't know they changed their policy.

637
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:49.580
Why would you go to the hospital alone? Like you don't have a family?

638
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.080
I'm the only one who didn't know about your diagnosis.

639
00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:57.490
I get a call about your procedure like I'm being called to go on a picnic.

640
00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:03.700
You can't be like that to your daughter.

641
00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:06.520
Why would you make me a bad daughter?

642
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:08.260
Did anybody say you were bad?

643
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:13.180
Everyone knows you can't even come home because you work long hours.

644
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.490
Don't worry about me and do your own thing.

645
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:17.460
How could I not worry about you when you're hurt?

646
00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:20.480
Who's hurt? They said I'm okay!

647
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.520
You yourself should eat and sleep properly as you work.

648
00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:31.560
I'm always making you worry.

649
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:37.200
Why can't you do the same to me?

650
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:42.980
I'm a bit...

651
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:49.310
immature, but even so, I can still take care of you, so please just believe in me. Please.

652
00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:57.030
Why would you have to be responsible for me? Do I have a terminal disease?

653
00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:00.010
If you're going to nag, save it for your child later.

654
00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:05.400
Whether you receive sperm or whatever, do whatever you want after conceiving. It's so annoying.

655
00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.750
No, that—

656
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.620
I thought I could raise them well.

657
00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:24.660
But I didn't think about them growing up without a dad.

658
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.970
My greed...

659
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:40.140
I was fine even with only having you,

660
00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.690
so I thought I could do well.

661
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.030
I should have thought about the child first.

662
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:00.430
I don't have the qualifications.

663
00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:06.530
Did someone say something to you?

664
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:08.580
No.

665
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:15.310
Oh my goodness, parents conceive a baby because they want to.

666
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.480
What baby is born because they want to?

667
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:20.750
Do you think you asked me to be born

668
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:25.340
and I conceived you? You're saying nonsense.

669
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:31.550
Did I have to study and take an exam? You're supposed to just learn as you raise the baby!

670
00:53:31.550 --> 00:53:36.050
What qualifications are you talking about?

671
00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:39.010
Aunt is right, there's no license for it.

672
00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:43.200
If there was a qualification exam, our aunt would be first place.

673
00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:46.390
So be good to your mother.

674
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:51.030
I don't see this as an argument. You are in the process of reconciling and healing, right?

675
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:52.400
It's nice to see.

676
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.460
Doha's crying. I'll leave you to wrap it up.

677
00:53:54.460 --> 00:53:58.440
Love you! Doha!

678
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:02.460
What is he saying, that crazy...!

679
00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:34.800
You're not drinking? Let's do one glass.

680
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.000
I'm not drinking because I'm afraid I'll be an alcoholic like you.

681
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.720
I'll sue you for slander.

682
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:43.520
Don't do it. I want to stop receiving punishments.

683
00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:53.300
What can you do? You're just going through the hardships needed to become a mom.

684
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:59.520
Now thinking about it, you also didn't ask me.

685
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:01.080
Ask what?

686
00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.020
Nobody ever asked about the reasons, but Han Yisang asked me

687
00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:10.570
why I wanted to become a mother.

688
00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:18.480
Is there another reason besides your motherly instincts?

689
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.070
That's true. That's it probably.

690
00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:29.830
But I came home and I thought about that day.

691
00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:33.630
The day I graduated from elementary school.

692
00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:41.760
<i>Don't be stingy, just buy her a big bouquet. And take a lot of pictures.</i>

693
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.150
<i>Don't go anywhere else. Otherwise, I'll get angry!</i>

694
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.400
<i>Okay.</i>

695
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:02.400
<i>Dad, buy me a rose. A big one.</i>

696
00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:13.010
<i>Hari, I'm going to put some film into my camera. You should go first.</i>

697
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:15.550
<i>- Do you even know my classroom? 
 - Huh?</i>

707
00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:09.230

What's a cool person?

731
00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:05.120
Mom.

732
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:14.190
I think my mom is the coolest person in the world.

733
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.120
Mom.

734
01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:12.950
They'll probably cut her salary for 1 to 3 months.

735
01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.140
Is this fun?

736
01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:17.500
I'm worried.

737
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:22.730
What could be worse for a salaryman than not making money?

738
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.710
Is it that wrong?

739
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:29.690
Not getting paid is the worst thing that can happen to an employee.

740
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:34.750
I should have quietly taken care of those mothers.

741

How did it go?

742
01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.630
1-month suspension.

743
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:48.880
What?

744
01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:52.070
Then she won't get paid for a month?

745
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.680
Are you serious? It's not as serious, not as much as to get suspended!

746
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:58.120
It's almost the deadline, what are we going to do?

749
01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:07.920

She got suspended for a month.

She looks super angry, right?
