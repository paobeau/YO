What are you two doing?

18
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.840
You care much about Zhao Fanzhou.

19

What about Cai Yasi?

I am arranging the books.

Let me help you.

37
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.280
I am not asking you for a favor.

38
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.260
Obviously, it is our common work.

Life on Mars

44
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.280
It is almost finished.

45
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.180
Don't return it after you finish reading it.

46
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.840
Please lend it to me.

47
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.470
I also want to read it.

48
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:49.300
OK.

49
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.300
Detective novels
have been growing on me recently.

50
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.400
Could you recommend some to me?

51
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.710
You are also interested in detective novels?

52
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.460
Great!

53
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.310
I will make a reading list for you later.

54
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.860
OK.

55
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.980
The book Life on Mars

56
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.700
doesn't sound like a detective novel.

57
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:24.380
How do you like

58
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.310
this book?

59
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.860
This book

60
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.620
is quite interesting.

61
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.800
It tells about...

62
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.430
Oh no.

63
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.360
Can't be spoiler.

64
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.600
See for yourself.

66
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.580
I am sure you haven't had breakfast.

67
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.480
Drink some coffee.

68
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.950
Drink some coffee.

69
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.070
I don't drink coffee.

70
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.480
Don't refuse me, please.

71
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.060
I want to show my kindness to you.

72
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.920
I said I don't drink coffee.

73
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.600
I said

74
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.680
it is only my kindly feeling to you.

75
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.540
Could you please

76
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.260
show me some respect?

77
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.300
Thank you!

78
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.920
Was I cool?

79
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.240
Are you

80
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.390
infatuated with me completely?

81
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.800
Please look at yourself in the mirror.

82
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.680
But my mirror tells me every day

83
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.870
I am the most handsome athlete

84
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.700
in this world.

85
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.940
OK. Let's get started today.

86
00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.740
Today let's learn the core values.

87
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.920
Don't you think

88
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.920
I am very manly?

89
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.700
That is to say, I am very charming.

90
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.580
though

91
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:29.820
I may

92
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.340
look frivolous.

93
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.820
From time to time,

94
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.630
a look of ridicule,

95
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.900
indifference

96
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.020
or carelessness may flit across my eyes.

97
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.620
If you want to sit beside me,

98
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.540
you must be quiet.

99
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.760
Zhu Lu.

100
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:54.860
I,

101
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.870
I want to tell you something.

102
00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.390
If you want to say it,

103
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.270
feel free to say it out to me.

104
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.560
We can handle such a thing by ourselves.

105
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.750
But...

106
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.390
Let's talk as we walk.

107
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.740
OK.

108
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
Just say it.

109
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.180
Can I...

110
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.020
can I ask you out for a meal?

111
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.300
Sorry, I don't have time for that.

112
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.460
Well,

113
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.940
can you be my girlfriend?

114
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:25.390
No, I can't.

115
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.160
Wait.

116
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.750
Zhu Lu.

117
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.510
I have been watching you for long.

118
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.480
I watched your performance
at the school anniversary.

119
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.070
You, you were so pretty!

120
00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.540
I took lots of photos, too.

121
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.390
I

122
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.460
printed the most beautiful one on my pillow.

123
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.240
Really. I beg you.

124
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:41.490
I beg you to say yes.

125
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.060
If you don't stop, I'll call the guard.

126
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.140
You need not over-react.

127
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.140
You are not beautiful in an unmatched manner.

128
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.180
But...

129
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:50.660
What do you want to do?

130
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.820
But I really like you very much.

131
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.380
I really...

132
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:56.460
I will post your photos

133
00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.540
onto the forum.

134
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.500
Are you a pervert?

135
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.180
If you ignore me,

136
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.500
I will post your photos online

137
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.120
for everyone to see

138
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.860
how their goddess...

139
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:04.420
You are a psychopath!

140
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.620
... gets stripped of her halo.

141
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.340
Let's go.

142
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.020
Stop!

143
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.420
You must compensate for my phone.

144
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.860
Come to see me in dorm 508.

145
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.860
You should say sorry at least.

146
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.380
If you don't step aside,

147
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.580
I will make you pay with one arm and one leg.

148
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.860
Will you try me?

149
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:42.710
Fine.

150
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.710
Don't explain. I won't listen.

151
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.080
I didn't do it on purpose.

152
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.360
But it's pregnant. Don't you know?

153
00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.700
What do you want me to do?

154
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:59.320
Go look for it.

155
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.740
Zhao Fanzhou. Zhao Fanzhou.

156
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.840
Based on my observation,

157
00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.300
it must be that

158
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.420
the other woman got pregnant

159
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.220
and forced her to leave her man.

160
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.460
Shall I go console her?

161
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.220
OK, go.

162
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.020
I don't have any tissue.

163
00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.500
Can you lend me some?

164
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.050
Thank you!

165
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.340
Miss.

166
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.670
Are you all right?

167
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.900
Thank you!

168
00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:50.870
Don't be too sad.

169
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.030
Since she got pregnant,

170
00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.670
just let go of him.

171
00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:56.100
You will find a better man.

172
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.500
How could this happen?

173
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.460
I am held accountable for its pregnancy.

174
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.020
I must assume the responsibility.

175
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.220
You assume the responsibility?

176
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.910
You are too kind.

177
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.140
Shouldn't I be?

178
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.300
Why should you be held responsible?

179
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.860
You didn't make her pregnant.

180
00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:13.620
But I didn't keep an eye.

181
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.900
So I am held accountable.

182
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.500
Well, how could you stop that?

183
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.440
They just had a thing for each other.

184
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.060
You just fell in love with the wrong man.

185
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.020
You should have a new start.

186
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:23.440
What are you talking about?

187
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.300
I,

188
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.020
I overheard all just now standing there.

189
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:28.670
You said your boyfriend

190
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.420
made the other girl pregnant.

191
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:31.740
And you asked him to find her.

192
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.580
My cat is pregnant.

193
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.420
My boyfriend got it lost.

194
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.420
Aah?

195
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.580
It's true, Miss.

196
00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.660
Believe me.

197
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.860
Our Detective Club
will definitely find your cat.

198
00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.100
Thank you!

199
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.900
We have been looking for it for two days,

200
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.740
but it is still missing.

201
00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.460
Actually, I know

202
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.300
there is little possibility
for us to find it.

203
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.000
You are wrong.

204
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.600
You don't know how good we are.

205
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.860
We surely can do it.

206
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.000
Right?

207
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.260
You'd better make clear of the case
before saying so.

208
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.320
Why aren't you helping me when I am in need?

209
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.780
Well,

210
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.420
the Calling Card Effect,

211
00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.270
Mere Exposure Effect,

212
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.900
Salt Effect,

213
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.140
Dark Effect,

214
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.060
Suspension Bridge Effect,

215
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.300
Catfish Effect,

216
00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:28.860
Exposure Effect,

217
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:30.460
Halo Effect.

218
00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.500
According to Salt Effect,

219
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.910
what is needed is the best.

220
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.700
Fuel in snowy weather is way better

221
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.820
than an added grace in fair weather.

222
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.380
Make yourself needed the most by others.

223
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.720
We will find it.

224
00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.020
Then I am leaving.

225
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:12.740
I will return the clothes to you
after washing them.

226
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:14.600
Thank you!

227
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:16.240
To be honest,

228
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.080
since I was a college student,

229
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.390
doing laundry has been giving me a headache.

230
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.630
I should thank you.

231
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.900
Don't mention it.

232
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.550
If he dares pester you again,

233
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:26.600
just tell me.

234
00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.200
I will make him regret.

235
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.620
Thank you, anyway.

236
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:34.380
That's it?

237
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.340
Isn't there anything practical?

238
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:40.660
As a star of the generation,

239
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.480
shouldn't I be paid for offering help?

240
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.580
Forget it. I am kidding.

241
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.790
Hurry to go back.

242
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:53.470
I am off.

243
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.180
OK.

244
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:54.960
Bye bye!

245
00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.150
Hello, ma'am.

246
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:05.260
You are back.

247
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.620
Star of the generation.

248
00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.100
I will be practical.

249
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.000
I will treat you to a meal.

250
00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.750
You are still here?

251
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.480
I am waiting for you to look for the cat.

252
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.140
You really want to look for the cat with me?

253
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.750
I thought just now you were just
being coordinating.

254
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:34.320
Shall we go?

255
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:35.780
Yes.

256
00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:39.860
Let's go.

257
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.940
You, go check that area.

258
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:50.220
Kitty!

259
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.150
Meow!

260
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:52.390
Kitty!

261
00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.390
Meow!

262
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.580
Meow!

263
00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.340
Meow!

264
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.300
Kitty!

265
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.780
Kitty!

266
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:04.390
Meow!

267
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.910
Meow!

268
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:12.000
How can it be in there?

269
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.340
Let's go to another place.

270
00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.870
Kitty!

271
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.340
How is it? Did you find it?

272
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:22.900
No.

273
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.200
Then let's go check other places.

274
00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:27.870
Be careful!

275
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.270
Kitty!

276
00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.420
Meow!

277
00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:31.360
Meow!

278
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:34.980
No need.

279
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.420
Let's go check that area.

280
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:38.100
It is not here.

281
00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:38.960
Let's go.

282
00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.780
Kitty, where are you?

283
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:54.910
Wait a moment.

284
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.120
Could it be inside?

285
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.200
Let's go inside to find it out.

286
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:24.390
Wait up.

287
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:36.380
Well,

288
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.390
I think it is dark

289
00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.270
and scary here.

290
00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:42.150
How about this?

291
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.510
Let's come back tomorrow.

(Two Factor Theory of Emotion.)

293
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.500
We'd better go inside now.

294
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:02.600
Why?

295
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.380
Can't we come again tomorrow?

296
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.440
Because the eyes of the cat glow in the dark.

297
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:08.870
It is easier for us to find it.

298
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.150
Well,

299
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:14.900
can you go inside alone?

300
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.060
I will wait for you outside.

301
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:16.820
No, I can't.

302
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:18.720
Why?

303
00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:20.150
Because

304
00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.000
I am also scared.

305
00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:37.550
I am the matter.

306
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:38.750
You are the consciousness.

Matter decides consciousness.

308
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.440
So you are not gonna hurt me.

309
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:44.500
Matter decides consciousness.

310
00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.660
Matter decides consciousness.

311
00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.180
I am the matter.

312
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.750
You are consciousness.

313
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.340
So you can never hurt me.

314
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.980
Matter decides consciousness.

315
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.720
I am the matter.

316
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.980
You are consciousness.

317
00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.460
Help! I step on something.

318
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.820
Don't worry. It is just a plate.

319
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.030
Just a plate?

320
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.110
I am scared to death.

321
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.480
Wait up.

322
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.920
What is the matter?

323
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:38.240
Please let me hold your arm.

331
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.920
Something is here!

332
00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.160
It is the electric wire.

333
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.100
Hand.

334
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.380
Your hand.

336
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.340
Thank you!

337
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:09.780
Sorry.

338
00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.110
Why need you say sorry?

339
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.260
I shouldn't have let you in.

340
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.550
It doesn't matter.

341
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.980
Now I am eager to eat

342
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.100
the cantaloupe-flavored ice cream

343
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.140

We should approach it from new perspectives.

347
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.060
I will follow your instructions.

348
00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:58.270
Then let's think about it tonight.

349
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.240
We will meet in the Detective Club tomorrow

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.860
to share our ideas.

351
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.180
Let's try to crack this case sooner.

352
00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:04.960
OK.

353
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.200
Eat it.

354
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.300
Why don't you eat it?

355
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.110
It is yummy.

356
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.270
Report!

357
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.500
Report!

358
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.030
The freshman Xie Yixing
of the Department of Physical Education

359
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:51.820
has been invited by Zhu Lu to have a meal.

360
00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:52.750
End of report!

361
00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.000
Hmm.

362
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.960
Congratulations!

363
00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.820
Why are you uninterested?

364
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.300
Come on! Let me show you.

365
00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.270
I will read the message for you.

366
00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.260
Come on!

367
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.440
Star of the generation.

368
00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.750
I will be practical.

369
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.140
I will treat you to a meal.

370
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.240
Star of the generation.

371
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:18.820
I will be practical.

372
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.750
I will treat you to a meal.

373
00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:23.640
Star of the generation.

374
00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.660
I will be practical.

375
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.220
I will treat you to a meal.

376
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.440
Listen to it.

377
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.500
Is it the signal of love?

378
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.740
Is it love?

379
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:32.790
This is love.

380
00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:39.720
The Psychology of Love.

381
00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:41.270
Fanzhou.

382
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.640
Why have you started to read such books?

383
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.920
You seem to have no desire for love
in ordinary days.

384
00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.780
But love fire has been ignited in your heart.

385
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:49.620
Want to be in a relationship now?

386
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:52.100
Don't rush to deny it.

387
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.020
Yes.

388
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:55.960
Well...

389
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.880
With whom?

390
00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.060
Zhou Xiao.

391
00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.100
Zhou Xiao?

392
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.300
The girl wooed by a guy
at the school anniversary?

393
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:06.740
The president of the Detective Club?

394
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.060
How come everyone likes her?

395
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:11.440
She is more popular than me.

396
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.640
Fanzhou,

397
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:20.260
stop reading these useless books.

398
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.140
You should learn more from me.

399
00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:22.830
Right?

400
00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.260
After all, I have received

401
00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:26.100
the invitation to a meal.

402
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.070
A girl will treat me to a meal.

403
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.510
What does it mean?

404
00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.580
It means I must begin to save money

405
00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:32.960
to buy a house for our children
in the school district.

406
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.270
You can't learn this from the books.

407
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:39.100
She has treated me to a meal.

408
00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.550
Excuse me.

409
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.590
Star of the generation.

410
00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.220
Star of the generation.

411
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.070
I will be practical.

412
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:03.980
I will treat you to a meal.

413
00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.550
What should we eat?

414
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.660
Star of the generation.

415
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:09.960
I will be practical.

416
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.920
I will treat you to a meal.

417
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.740
Star of the generation.

418
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.860
I will be practical.

419
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.270
Well, I am too excited.

420
00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:20.700
I must consume some energy.

421
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:30.350
Fanzhou.

422
00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.640
Fanzhou.

423
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.420
The Dark Effect.

424
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.660
In a dim place,

425
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.000
have a date.

426
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:56.750
Your date will relax her guard

427
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.240
because she can't see
your expressions clearly.

428
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:32.400
Hey!

429
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.720
Hey, Fanzhou.

430
00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:35.640
Aren't you in the Forensic Lab?

431
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.420
What do you want from me?

432
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:40.260
One of my courses is almost finished.

433
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.460
I need your help with it.

434
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.540
Where are you? I will go see you.

435
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.140
The Detective Club.

436
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.340
Well,

437
00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.350
I will go see you there, all right?

438
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.420
All right.

439
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.220
Go on watching the PPT.

440
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:05.720
Read Guan Hanqing's work

441
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.660
"Double Tune:
Intoxicated by the East Wind" silently.

442
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.380
Here are two questions.

443
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.240
First,

444
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.980
how does the author

445
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.880
depict the image
of the protagonist of this ballad?

446
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.260
Second, from the perspective
of content and technique,

447
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.160
expound the characteristics of

448
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.070
this ballad and this genre.

449
00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.720
Conduct divergent thinking.

450
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:37.900
Professor, I am wrong.

451
00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:39.580
Professor.

452
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:41.350
I've revenged you.

453
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.820
This can't happen again.

454
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:50.620
Thank you, professor!

455
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.070
Class is over.

456
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.140
Zhou Xiao.

457
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:54.980
My bad. My bad.

458
00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.580
Zhao Fanzhou and I will go look for the cat.

459
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.380
See you later.

460
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.620
Both Cai Yasi and Zhao Fanzhou like her.

461
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.830
Zhou Xiao is really something.

462
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:11.380
Wei,

463
00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.380
you should learn from Zhou Xiao.

464
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.060
Ah?

465
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.380
Fanzhou.

466
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.550
What do you need?

467
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.240
This is the thing.

468
00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.180
Our teacher gave us an assignment.

469
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.220
It is about psychology.

470
00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.620
We must conduct a hypnosis

471
00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.620
to find out its role in psychology.

472
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.030
But you know that

473
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:40.820
most people consider hypnosis
to be sensitive.

474
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.860
I asked a lot of people,
but nobody wanted to help.

475
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.540
So I have to seek help from you.

476
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.340
OK.

477
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.940
After you decide the time and place,

478
00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.020
just notify me.

479
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.000
Really?

480
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.820
Yes.

481
00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:52.540
So you will help me?

482
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:53.260
Yes.

483
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:56.460
Actually, my real psychology homework

484
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.830
is to make someone accept
the hypnosis unconsciously.

485
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.830
Will you sign your name here?

486
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.750
Please.

487
00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:16.900
I thought we had drifted apart.

488
00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:18.550
I didn't expect
that you still saw me as a friend.

489
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.340
It was not like what you saw.

490
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.300
I can explain it to you.

491
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.740
No need.

492
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:31.140
It is my problem.

493
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:32.180
Go on, both of you.

494
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:34.460
Fanzhou, sorry!

495
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.100
How about I go explain it to her?

496
00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.580
No need.

497
00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.480
Just leave.

498
00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.880
Don't do this next time.

499
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.260
Zhou Xiao.

500
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.540
I am sorry for what happened just now.

501
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.740
Do you have any club activities?

502
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.140
Then I am off.

503
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.900
Otherwise,

504
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.300
Fanzhou will blame me.

505
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.020
Well, it was me

506
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.020
who disturbed you.

507
00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.620
What are you thinking?

508
00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:57.740
It is not like that.

509
00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:00.060
Bye bye!

510
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.020
I am leaving.

511
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:03.700
Bye bye!

512
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:13.860
Hi!

513
00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.660
I am back.

514
00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.540
Um.

515
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:21.920
I'm sorry for what happened just now.

516
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.580
I don't think you are.

517
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:27.420
You ran away so fast.

518
00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.100
Why is he angry?

519
00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.020
Well.

520
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:33.580
I came up with an idea
about how to find the cat.

521
00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.740
The cat got lost around the male dormitory.

522
00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.300
So we will take
the male dormitory as a center

523
00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.460
and scatter the litter

524
00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.420
in its surrounding area of 400 square meters.

525
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.240
Then the smell will attract the cat.

526
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.660
About what happened just now...

527
00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:46.940
Sorry, wait a moment.

528
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.220
Hello!

529
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.440
Hello!

530
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:53.510
What is the matter?

531
00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.110
The missing person appeared.

532
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.860
I am locked up.

533
00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.860
What for?

534
00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:00.750
Nothing special.

535
00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.220
I am undergoing the ACM intensified training.

536
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.000
So what?

537
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.020
I just wanted to tell you that

538
00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.480
I am gonna be out of your sight for one week.

539
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:11.980
That's good.

540
00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.620
Put more work into it.

541
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.980
And become a better person.

542
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.350
See you.

543
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.350
It seems that

544
00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.550
she really
didn't take my love confession seriously.

545
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.900
How can Cai Yasi act like this?

546
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.460
He is not focusing
on the intensified training.

547
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:36.830
Why did he have to disturb our cat searching?

548
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:38.820
What did you want to say just now?

549
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:50.540
(Catfish Effect)

550
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.980
Jia Yichun came to see me just now.

551
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.270
Who else can it be?

552
00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.960
She couldn't have come to see me.

553
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.350
She asked me to help
with her hypnosis homework.

554
00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.200
I agreed to help her.

555
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.240
You are really a nice guy.

556
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.420
Her homework doesn't concern me at all.

557
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.110
She did that just now

558
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.030
only to thank me.

559
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.420
You... she was so polite.

560
00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:36.060
Let's hurry to look for the cat.

561
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.740
Let's go.

562
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:44.300
(Catfish Effect)

563
00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.130
(Small fish will struggle for survival
if there's a catfish among them.)

564
00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:47.590
(Catfish Effect is to take measures
to motivate companies)

565
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:48.980
(to actively compete in the market
and stir the trade.)

566
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:59.900
Hello, do you have a reservation?

567
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.590
Yes, I do.

568
00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.400
I am Mr. Xie,

569
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.550
who have called to book the dimmest room.

570
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.250
OK. Follow me, please.

571
00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.750
OK.

572
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.830
Wait up. Don't move.

573
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.350
Thank you!

574
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.460
One moment, please.

575
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.550
I will bring you the menu.

576
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.070
OK.

577
00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.070
How do you like it?

578
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.240
The vibe of this restaurant

579
00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.240
is nice, right?

580
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.640
Such an upscale and elegant restaurant

581
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:42.000
suits our style very much.

582
00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:44.960
It suits me well, not you.

583
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.250
Here, Lu.

584
00:31:59.270 --> 00:31:59.680
Here.

585
00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.200
Did you...

586
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.000
get your neck twisted?

587
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:20.640
Don't you think

588
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.440
the contour of my left face
is cleanly-chiseled?

589
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.680
Isn't it very handsome?

590
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.000
I just feel that you are kind of squint-eyed.

591
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:31.590
Why haven't I noticed before?

592
00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.880
Isn't this the Dark Effect?

593
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:38.680
Why didn't it work?

594
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:43.200
Is it because this place is not dark enough?

595
00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.680
What are you mumbling?

596
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.030
Lu,

597
00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:49.640
should I ask the waitress

598
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.030
to take away the candles?

599
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.070
I feel I am worshiping the Bodhisattva

600
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:54.860
with them burning.

601
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.340
You shouldn't.

602
00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:58.020
It is dim here.

603
00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.300
Without the candles,
we may put food into our noses.

604
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:17.740
What are you doing?

605
00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:19.440
I...

606
00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:23.900
I just wanted to find out

607
00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:25.100
whether the alcohol in the red wine can burn.

608
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.110
You did it on purpose, right?

609
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.460
Why don't you try with your brain

610
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.340
to see whether it can burn.

611
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.240
I just said it is dark here
and you damped it down.

612
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.060
Are you trying to piss me off intentionally?

613
00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.480
No, I didn't mean that.

614
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.140
Don't be angry, Lu.

615
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:40.720
Waitress.

616
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:42.030
Hello!

617
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.790
I am sorry!

618
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.590
Well,

619
00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.700
must I do this?

620
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.380
Must I keep the bell ringing

621
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.400
as I scatter the cat litter?

622
00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:53.550
I feel I am performing
a religious ceremony.

623
00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.110
The bell can make continuous sounds

624
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.060
to attract the attention of the cat.

625
00:33:58.700 --> 00:33:59.860
Why don't you carry it yourself?

626
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:01.980
I am not fit for that.

627
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:07.660
Meow.

628
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.000
Meow.

629
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.500
I almost scattered all the cat litter.

630
00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.260
But I didn't even find a cat hair.

631
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.480
If I had known pulling surveillance footage
is forbidden,

632
00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.760
I should have asked Cai Yasi

633
00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.900
to pull all the surveillance footage

634
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.100
of our campus by hacking

635
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:23.920
before he started the closed training.

636
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.920
What should we do now?

637
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.630
Ahead.

638
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:50.440
Here.

639
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.980
It looks so weak.

640
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:00.280
It is going to give birth to kittens.

641
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.840
Let's hurry to send it to the pet hospital.

642
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:03.480
There is no time for that.

643
00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.000
It has been suffering
difficult labor for long.

644
00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.020
Let's go.

645
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.340
Bring it to the Forensic Lab.

646
00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:07.940
Ah?

647
00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:08.480
Go!

648
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.280
Wait outside.

649
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.260
But.

650
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.220
A surgery may be necessary.

651
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.580
You'd better wait outside.

652
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.100
Then I...

653
00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.860
Believe me.

654
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.620
How is it?

655
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.620
Come in to check it out.

656
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.440
OK.

657
00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.340
Why must we take this road?

658
00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:01.920
It is so dark.

659
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:04.440
This road

660
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.440
is a shortcut.

661
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.550
It won't be a shortcut if you walk so slowly.

662
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.060
Why are you

663
00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.280
walking so fast?

664
00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.360
Let's have a chat.

665
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.590
I invited you to watch a movie,
but you refused.

666
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:16.900
It will take two hours to watch a movie.

667
00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.230
After we finish it, it will be too late.

668
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:22.230
Let's sit for a while
by the lake behind, shall we?

669
00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:25.230
Are you all right?

670
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.070
I don't want to.

671
00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.260
Then let's go sit on the playground.

672
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:32.700
No, I won't.

673
00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.500
How about the cafeteria?

674
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.220
No. It is closed.

675
00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.620
But we can still go there.

676
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:40.980
Forget it. Forget it.

677
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.030
Let's go back to the dorm.

678
00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:43.070
Let's go back to the dorm.

679
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.030
Science is not my thing.

680
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.180
It's licking me.

681
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.710
Yes.

682
00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:08.880
Don't be so indifferent.

683
00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:09.710
Touch it.

684
00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:12.460
Touch it.

685
00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.230
You did a great job today.

686
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:30.420
Without you,

687
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.800
I wouldn't have known what to do.

688
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480
Thank you for saving them.

689
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:35.960
Don't mention it.

690
00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:42.550
Do you feel them?

691
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.840
Are they super cute?

692
00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.630
Yes, they are.

693
00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.820
Kittens,

694
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.900
now your savior

695
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.880
is talking to you.

696
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.300
Are you feeling

697
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.190
the vitality?

698
00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:59.700
(Salt Effect)

699
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.590
(It means things should be moderate
and used at the right moment.)

700
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.460
("What you need is the best.")

701
00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.920
Zhao Fanzhou,

702
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.380
even if I had your back,

703
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:16.900
you couldn't do such an improper thing.

704
00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.820
You brought your girlfriend into the lab.

705
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.620
I was fine with that.

706
00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.940
After all, it is rare for you

707
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.420
to fall in love once.

708
00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:25.980
But unexpectedly,

709
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.100
you helped a cat give birth
in the Forensic Lab.

710
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.980
You have broken the rules of the lab.

711
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.060
You didn't show me any respect.

712
00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.260
How should I handle this?

713
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.460
Professor, I am sorry.

714
00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.420
I am willing to accept the punishment.

715
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.380
Never mind. You're not my assistant anymore.

716
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.840
Professor.

717
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.500
I really wanted to put a serious demerit
on your record.

718
00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.340
Leave.

719
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.260
Hello, Miss.

720
00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.860
How are the kittens?

721
00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.860
No need. No need.

722
00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.940
You are welcome.

723
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:03.340
OK.

724
00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:04.000
See you!

725
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:08.440
Zhao Fanzhou.

726
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.460
What are you doing here?

727
00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.880
I came to fetch my bag
left in the lab yesterday.

728
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.300
I thought you would come in the afternoon.

729
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.620
It occurred to me that

730
00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:19.700
my textbook needed
in the afternoon was in it.

731
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.460
So I came.

732
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.550
Oh.

733
00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.280
It is in the locker.

734
00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.900
Go fetch it by yourself.

735
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:27.710
But

736
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.180
I don't know where your locker is.

737
00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:32.300
The third one on the left by the door.

738
00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.540
It is not proper for me
to fumble in your locker.

739
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:36.540
You'd better fetch it for me.

740
00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:37.500
It's fine.

741
00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.500
Go get it by yourself.

742
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.780
I am not a student of your department.

743
00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.060
Moreover,

744
00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.620
if I search your locker,

745
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:45.670
I may be seen as a thief.

746
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.060
It's impossible.

747
00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:49.580
It's just a few steps away.

748
00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:51.380
If you had time to talk,

749
00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.510
you could have fetched it.

750
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.660
I can't fetch it for you.

751
00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.220
Ah?

752
00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:00.070
Why?

753
00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.900
Because Professor made me stand here
as punishment.

754
00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:07.980
You were made to stand here?

755
00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.540
How can a college student
be punished like this?

756
00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.860
Sorry!

757
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:19.020
I can't help it.

758
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:23.540
Standing as a punishment.

759
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:30.400
Ouch!

760
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.220
Standing as a punishment.

761
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.660
(Next Episode)
I've heard that

762
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.280
the Geminids will come tomorrow.

763
00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.100
I'll go there too.

764
00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.820
Let's go and see
the Detective Exhibition together.

765
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:02.460
But I've agreed

766
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.820
to go there with Cai Yasi.

767
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:06.180
Fanzhou, I'll get a good position for you.

768
00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.180
I have to go to the playground to see
the meteor shower with my roommates.

769
00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:08.980
Let's go together.
