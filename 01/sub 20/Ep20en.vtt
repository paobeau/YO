(Previously on Episode 19) I like you.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.540
Could you like me back?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.420
Zhou Xiao!

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.020
We're so dead.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.740
Dad.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.580
(Episode 20: Disapproving Father)

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.780
Zhou Xiao!

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.500
We're so dead.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.700
Have I told you

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.580
my dad is a disciplinary director,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.700
a PE teacher

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.060
and a provincial Chinese boxing champion?

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:39.700
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.860
I'm Zhao Fanzhou,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.700
Zhou Xiao's boyfriend.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.940
Mom, it hurts, it hurts.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.740
It hurts?

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.580
Confess everything if it hurts.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.940
Mom.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.540
You've tortured me
before I could say anything.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.420
So tyrannical.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.620
What did you say?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.380
OK. I'll confess everything.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.100
That's more like it.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.580
Answer me.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.500
What's his name and how old is he?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.580
Which college does he go to?

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.540
What does he major in?

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780
How big is his family
and where does he come from?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.300
Can you ask one question at a time?

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.420
I didn't even remember them.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.900
How can I answer you?

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.300
What's his name?

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.820
Tell me now.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.700
His name is Zhao Fanzhou.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.580
Nineteen years old.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.140
We're in the same college.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.380
He studies forensic medicine

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.260
and he's from Nanshi.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.820
There are three people in his family,
I guess.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.100
He studies forensic medicine?

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.580
What's wrong with that?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.660
Why did you react like this? You scared me.

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.620
You have prejudice

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.820
against forensic medicine.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940
What makes you think

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.980
that I have prejudice against it?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.460
Forensic medicine?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.620
That's the look you had just now.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.740
Every job deserves to be respected,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.980
especially being a ME.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.740
Many people don't dare to do this
or understand it

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.060
so we should have more respect for it.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.260
What did I say

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.820
that makes you...

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.260
Alright. Alright.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.860
Well,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.540
I'll put aside my prejudice,

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.300
okay?

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.100
That's more like it.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.180
Mr. Zhou,

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.700
the water is boiling.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.220
I know.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.540
Okay.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.420
Tell me.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.220
How did you

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.860
and he

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.100
get in a relationship?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.740
Why do you wanna know about that?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.860
Just tell me.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.580
He's such a handsome chap.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.100
How did you shamelessly chase after him?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.260
Mom,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.340
aren't you too unconfident
about your daughter?

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.820
He shamelessly chased after me, okay?

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.220
Yes. Yes. Yes.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.460
He chased you. He chased you.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.500
Quickly. Tell me

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.820
how he shamelessly chased you.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.940
It started from the first day of school.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.420
That day...

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.020
I'll stand up and make myself clear.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:42.540
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.900
A rule of our family

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.900
is that you won't drink

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.540
before the elders let you.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.100
Okay.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.380
I've got it, Mr. Zhou.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.340
Obeying rules

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.860
and behaving properly

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.140
are very important,

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.220
especially in public.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.500
You know what I mean, don't you?

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:25.460
Zhou Xiao!

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.820
Yes,

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.420
Mr. Zhou.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.780
Is that all?

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.180
That's really all, mom.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.580
Hurry up.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.540
I'm starving.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:38.060
Please cook.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.020
When has your mom cooked?

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.060
Dad,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.420
are you...

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.860
are you going to a wedding reception?

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:46.620
Why are you dressing like that?

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.580
I always dress like this.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.100
When has your mom cooked?

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.220
In our Zhou family,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.900
men always cook.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.780
When have you cooked...

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.500
Yes. I've never cooked home.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.340
It's always the men who cook in our family.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.180
Mr. Zhou,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.740
I'll be your helper.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:18.580
Okay.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.540
No, you won't.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.820
Don't be so modest.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.860
Let us see how well you cook.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:25.700
Dad,

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.900
well,

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.420
he's a guest.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.780
How can you ask a guest to cook?

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:31.780
Right.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.380
Is he a guest?

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.060
Are you a guest?

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.500
If you consider yourself as that,

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.820
I'll doubt whether you wanna be
a future member of our family.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.060
I'll try, Mr. Zhou.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:53.700
The kitchen is over there.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:55.260
Okay.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.580
You can handle it.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.180
Wow,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.980
this is unexpected. He can cook.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.100
I didn't know that either.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.660
That's nothing. It just looks nice.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.500
You have to taste it to see if it's good.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:08.820
Go back to our room.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:10.500
Why?

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.220
I need to do something.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:12.820
What is it?

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.740
Tell you things about your son-in-law.

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.780
Open the door. Open the door.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:33.460
Are you bored?

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.260
No.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.540
Let me help you.

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.300
No, thanks.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.020
Get out of here.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.700
Don't underestimate me.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.660
I can wash vegetables and things.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:41.860
What shall I wash?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.460
I'll do it myself.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.420
Get out of here.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.620
Why do you keep asking me to go?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.980
Because your dad wants me

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.300
to obey rules

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.620
and behave properly.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.780
Stay away from me.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.540
No.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.980
Stop playing around.

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:06.540
I...

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.700
Be a good girl.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.060
Get out of here

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.300
and watch TV.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.620
Be good.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.540
Go and watch TV.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.940
I don't wanna watch TV.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.500
I wanna help you.

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.380
Be good.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:21.860
Go.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:22.820
Go.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:24.980
Go, go, go.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.940
Your lovable girl is back.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.020
I'll count from one to three

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:56.940
and you'll let go.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.940
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.380
I'm not letting go of you.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.140
What shall I do
so that you'll stop acting up?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.420
Let me stay here and help you.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.740
Stay away from me.

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.180
Don't move.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:28.980
I have carefully

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.780
investigated him

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.100
and got so much information.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.220
And you've got nothing.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.980
Stop looking at your phone.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.220
You have sat there for half an hour,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.420
sulking in front of Fanzhou,

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.740
and didn't ask him anything.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.100
Fanzhou, Fanzhou.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.540
Are you close to him?

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.380
That's a must.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:52.220
He's my future son-in-law.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:53.540
I must be close to him.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.260
And I think he matches

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.260
our daughter in every respect,

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.700
including appearance
and educational background.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.500
I just can't get it.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.220
Tell me.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:05.140
Why do you think little of him?

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.340
What makes him unworthy of your daughter?

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.580
He's unworthy of her in every way.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.100
Okay.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.540
Okay.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.260
Fine.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.300
Your daughter...

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.380
your daughter has many admirers.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.140
She's an angel

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.660
and she can be part of a girl group.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.260
Is that okay now?

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.460
As a teacher,

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.100
you indulge yourself in bands and groups.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.180
Is that appropriate?

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.260
Of course it is.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.700
I've got to catch up with my students.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.620
Yasi.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.300
Mr. Zhou,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.900
the automatic vegetables-collecting

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.540
software you asked me to write is done.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:43.780
I'll help you install it in a couple of days.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.700
Thank you so much.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.820
Getting up at midnight to steal vegetables

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.900
is too tiring.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.180
Don't you feel ashamed?

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.980
My goodness,

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.980
AlphaGo is invincible already

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.980
but someone is still stealing vegetables.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:57.900
Okay, okay.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:58.580
Thank you.

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.700
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:00.540
Goodbye.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:03.780
Well, well,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.100
Yasi is such a good boy.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.100
But he's still not your child.

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.260
And I don't think

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.020
Fanzhou is

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.300
worse than Yasi.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.140
Look,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:16.780
I won't approve of it.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.180
Yasi has just reached

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.100
the standard of being my son-in-law.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.740
That guy, whatever Zhou he is,

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.340
is not a patch on him.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.540
Stop combing your hair.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:41.420
Is that necessary?

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.140
None of your business.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.100
I have to give my future son-in-law

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.660
a good impression.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:47.780
Hello,

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:48.860
Mr. Zhou.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:50.740
Yasi,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:51.780
where are you?

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.260
Are you home?

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.420
Do you have anything to eat?

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.140
Coat the chicken wings

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.940
with flour.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.220
I'm sorry. Sorry.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:08.820
I really am.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:10.860
I'm sorry.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.700
I swear.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.260
You're like a little cat now.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:26.540
Dad,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:27.420
I didn't.

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.580
You're so chicken.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.460
Is that fun?

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.140
Yeah.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:36.580
Let's do something funnier.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:04.900
What are you thinking about?

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.620
Have fun yourself. I'm going.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.820
Zhou Xiao.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:50.220
Zhou Xiao,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.060
aren't you gonna help me set the table?

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.220
No.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.620
Alright.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:14.540
Why are you here?

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.340
What?

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:15.780
Am I not welcomed here?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.820
Your dad asked me to come and have dinner.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:18.980
My dad asked you to come?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.020
Yes.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.020
What smells so good?

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.100
What did Mrs. Zhou cook?

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:25.300
The cook today isn't my mom,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.380
but Zhao Fanzhou.

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.340
You're in luck. I'm telling you.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:29.900
Even I haven't tried things he cooked.

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:31.740
Fanzhou, are these dishes all?

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:32.660
Yes.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.140
You also made soup.

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:36.100
Put it here.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.540
Be careful.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.180
It's hot.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.140
Come on,

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.500
take a seat.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.580
That's Zhou Xiao's seat.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:49.940
Sit there.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:50.660
Sit there.

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:52.660
I'm here.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.820
Quickly. Ask Fanzhou

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.020
to sit and eat.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:18:59.540
Come on,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:00.180
eat.

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:01.140
Help yourself.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.100
Okay, Mrs. Zhou.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.300
Thank you so much today.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:06.460
I didn't expect you could cook.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.580
Our Zhou Xiao has gone

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.140
in the kitchen few times.

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.140
You haven't tried anything yet.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.660
You're so careless with your comments.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.180
Well, okay,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.380
you're careful.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.220
Please try some.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.300
Make your comments.

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.100
How does it taste?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.380
It's overcooked.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:44.740
Let me try.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.220
It looks fine.

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.900
It's good. Good.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.140
Crisp on the outside
and tender on the inside.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.220
Eat. Eat.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.020
I'll try some, too.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:19:59.700
Go on.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:00.420
Eat.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.620
Haven't you eaten any good things?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.340
Okay,

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.740
you've eaten good things. Don't eat it.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.060
I'll eat it.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:07.020
Who cares?

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:09.940
I really didn't expect this.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.580
Because kids of your age

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.460
usually can't cook

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.220
or even tell Chinese chives from wheat.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.340
How come you can?

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.380
If Zhou Xiao is half as good as you,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:17.900
that will be great.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:19.980
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.700
Mom,

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.380
I'm also a good kid, okay?

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.220
Yasi,

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:30.940
eat.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.380
It's nice.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:54.820
Yasi!

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.340
What's the matter, Mr. Zhou?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:00.940
Well,

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.660
didn't you design some software

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:05.820
for me to steal vegetables?

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.340
Yes. Why?

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.060
Awesome.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:11.660
Lad,

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.620
you're very competent.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.660
You'll be a pillar of our country
in the future.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.220
What do you say, Zhao?

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:23.140
Yes.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:26.700
Tell me.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:27.980
Have you thought

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.860
about changing your major?

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:34.660
No.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.700
Dad, what do you want to say?

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.860
What does he change it for?

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.020
He's doing well in it.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.460
I hear he got a special grade scholarship
every year

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.740
and he'll be a medical examiner
after graduation.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.940
Civil servants

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.260
are also pillars of the country, right?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.700
He's not changing it.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.460
Eat. Eat.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.220
I didn't say he must do that.

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:00.900
Yasi,

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.780
you took part

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.100
in a contest

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.300
and won the first prize

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.940
and you're going abroad, right?

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.220
Yes.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.340
I was the champion of ACM-ICPC, China.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.740
Awesome.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.340
You got a big prize, didn't you?

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.500
You can make money

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:19.780
at such a young age already.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.820
It's your parents' good fortune to have you.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.020
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.980
It's useless however big the prize is.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.500
He wasted all of it.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.540
You're being jealous.

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700
Ask him if you don't believe me.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.300
What did you spend the money on? Tell him.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.380
Tell him.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.500
Equipment in games.

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.180
Don't talk while we're eating.

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:47.860
Just eat.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.020
Don't linger.

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.300
Zhao has to go home later.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.900
Don't.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.100
Just stay here.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.180
It's late. Stay here.

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:01.300
Don't go home.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:08.980
Why are you all looking at me?

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:10.420
Eat.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.860
Since then, the images of the missing kid

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.940
and the spooky murderer

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.620
have been haunting Chen Congjun.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.940
He couldn't let it go.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:36.740
Where's your dad?

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.060
I have no idea.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:40.500
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.260
Cut some watermelon for us.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:53.980
Later.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:55.060
They're gonna solve this case.

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:55.980
Don't talk now.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.540
I'll do it, Mrs. Zhou.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:01.580
We've bothered you so much. I'll...

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.540
It's okay.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:02.860
I'll go.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:03.500
You watch TV.

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:04.540
Okay.

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.780
Okay, thanks.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.980
What a good kid.

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:12.900
I'm good, too.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:17.420
It really tastes nice.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:37.780
Mr. Zhou,

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.140
Mrs. Zhou wants to eat some watermelon.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:56.420
Excuse me.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.020
I really can't understand you.

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.580
I asked you to watch TV.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:11.980
You stayed here.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.580
We ate watermelon and you were still here.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.140
You've hidden in this bedroom

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.100
for a night.

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.180
None of your business.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.420
When did you get in?

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.260
Why did you come back here?

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.180
Go and stay with them in the living room.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.340
Don't let them be alone.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.900
Are you crazy?

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.980
What time is it already?

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:31.100
Can't I get Fanzhou a quilt to sleep with?

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.060
Why do you behave

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.500
as if I'm harassing you?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.980
Obey rules.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.420
Behave properly.

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:04.620
Master.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:07.740
Miss,

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.780
please get a hold of yourself.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.740
Why did you suddenly do that?

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:28.260
Zhou Xiao likes joking all the time.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.220
I got you a quilt and a pillow.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.580
Sorry that you have to sleep

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.100
on the sofa tonight.

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:36.220
It's okay.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:37.420
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:38.260
You're welcome.

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.260
He doesn't have to sleep on the sofa.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:41.140
He doesn't.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.700
Where should he sleep, then?

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.740
Sleep with me.

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:58.220
It's so dusty.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.700
It was just last week

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.140
that I won the provincial boxing match
for elderly people.

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.940
I just got this trophy.

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.420
This room is so dusty.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.460
Don't sit there. Go to sleep.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:21.060
I'll sleep after wiping this.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.300
Mr. Zhou, let me do it for you.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:31.380
Okay.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.900
Wipe it clean.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.780
Don't neglect the hollows.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:39.660
Okay.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.420
Wipe this one, too.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.100
This, this

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:42.700
and these.

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.380
And these.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.940
Okay.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:48.700
Here.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.420
Mainly here.

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:50.220
Okay.

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:24.460
Turn off the light.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.780
Oh.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.180
Liu Yong:

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.100
Fifteen Suggestions for My Daughter
on Being in a Relationship.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:18.820
First,

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.900
you can let people know you're single

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:23.380
but

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.020
don't display your whole self under the sun.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.660
Even if you have a lot of good points,

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.860
let him discover them himself.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:32.740
Because only love

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.420
of some mystery

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:34.860
is beautiful.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.820
Zhou Zhenguo, what are you playing
in this early morning?

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.980
Get out and turn it off.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.460
Good morning, Mrs. Zhou.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.140
Good morning.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:49.660
You got up so early.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:50.820
Did you sleep well?

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:52.340
Yes. Yes.

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:53.700
Mrs. Zhou,

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.020
is there anything I can do for you?

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:57.940
Help me set the table. Thanks.

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:58.620
Okay.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:06.620
"Gee!"

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.460
With a moan,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.700
the medical examiner stood up

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.860
and there was a dangerous look in his eyes.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:14.500
He made a grab

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.420
at Detective Zhou's neck.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.340
Stop reading. Let me sleep for five more minutes.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.100
Detective Zhou spun

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.140
and kicked the medical examiner,

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:29.060
saying, "Ah, ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah."

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.980
My bad. I won't write novels anymore.

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:33.300
And then

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.820
the medical examiner
took out a sharp scalpel.

00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.060
The edge shone on his face

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.740
and exposed a vicious smile.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.900
Jesus,

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.860
you're the nastiest dad I've seen.

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:24.540
Morning.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:26.940
Morning.

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.420
You got toothpaste here.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.420
The opposite side.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:43.900
I wiped it off.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.020
Thanks.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.900
Are you awake now?

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.300
Can I not be?

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:04.060
Nothing.

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:05.860
Did you have a good sleep?

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:46.620
Kick his leg.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.860
Kick his leg.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.980
Kick it hard.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.940
Give him a hook.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:26.900
Hit him hard.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:28.740
Hit him hard.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.100
Hit him hard.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.260
Kick him.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:46.380
It was pretty good.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.380
Okay, then.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.780
Dad, morning.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.020
Quickly.

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:56.980
Quickly. Make room.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.380
Here comes the congee.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.700
Is it Congee with Pork and Century Egg?

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:01.620
Yes.

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:02.460
Congee with Pork and Century Egg.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:04.420
Let me tell you,

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.900
my mom's Congee with Pork and Century Egg

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:06.900
is superb.

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.900
Try it.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.700
You must try it today.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.140
It's first-class in the world.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.380
Now my daughter can be

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:23.700
so thoughtful of others.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:27.060
When haven't I been thoughtful?

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.420
Come on, try it.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.100
Get it yourself.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.860
I'll help you.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.300
You have had two of four pieces
of fermented tofu.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:56.500
Right. Can't we have one, too?

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.500
Can't the head of this family
have a piece of tofu?

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.860
Who?

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.460
Who's the head of this family?

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:18.620
We're a harmonious family and we shouldn't

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.100
talk about that, should we?

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.620
Things like that are divisive.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.460
Eat it.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:27.580
It's yours.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:28.900
It's especially yummy.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.340
Look at your daughter.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.380
Mom.

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.860
You have high blood pressure.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:37.780
Don't eat so much pickled food.

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.860
It contains preservative.

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.540
It won't go away even when you're dead.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.460
Right. That will be a great burden
on the environment.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.220
It's too bad.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.980
Eat some fried dough. You've had much congee.

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.540
Mom. Don't steal my pickled mustard tuber.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.740
What are you doing, mom?

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.060
I saved some for you.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:08.860
I saved some.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.540
There's still some of it.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.500
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.660
they robbed me of my food.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.180
The software Yasi designed for me
is really good.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.420
Last night I stole

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:03.980
all vegetables of Headmaster Wang.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.220
I'll drive him mad.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.900
Dad, why do you always have it in

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.260
for Headmaster Wang?

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.820
Who has it in for him?

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.380
It's he who always has it in for me.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.420
He envies my good harvest.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.820
And you envy him
having less forehead wrinkles.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.380
How are you talking to your dad?

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.620
Fanzhou,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.700
have some fruit.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:25.540
Okay. Thanks, Mrs. Zhou.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.020
Help yourself.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.140
Don't laugh at Zhou's forehead wrinkles.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:35.380
Laugh at his salary if you want to.

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.820
His salary is 1,200 yuan
less than mine this month.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.140
1,200 yuan.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:45.300
Zhou, you'll be a kept man
if it goes on like this.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.460
Fanzhou, help yourself.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:50.900
Okay.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:52.980
If you're free later,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.860
let Zhou Xiao show you around.

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:56.340
There's a forest park here.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.180
It's beautiful and the air is fresh.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.500
Okay, Mrs. Zhou.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.060
He's not going there.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:02.420
He needs to go home later.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.660
He's not going home.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.020
Since he's here,
he can stay for a few days. Can't you?

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.900
If you don't need to go to the lab,

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.940
just stay for a couple

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:13.980
of days at my house.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.140
Okay.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.620
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:20.820
Not at all.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.100
What a bad girl I have had.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:38.500
(Dad)

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.580
Dad.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.380
We're seeing him out. Be nice.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.300
I am seeing him out.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.940
Look at your long face.

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:57.380
Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:00.060
If my mom weren't feeling bad,

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.020
I would definitely stay here longer.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.740
It's okay. We understand.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.060
Next time you're here,

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.100
I'll prepare a nice meal for you.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:07.740
Thank you, Mrs. Zhou.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:08.820
You're welcome.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.100
I'll call you when I'm home.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:18.740
Mm.

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.100
Be careful on your way.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:20.820
Mm.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.420
Well, you two talk for a while.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.780
We'll go home.

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:28.420
Go.

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.300
What?

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.780
Go home.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:33.220
Give the young people some space.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.220
What space?

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:35.740
Just go now.

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.220
Go. Go.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.980
Aren't you being foolish?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:43.740
I have to watch that guy.

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.300
What if he behaves badly?

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.020
Stop calling him that guy.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.020
Why do you always pick on him?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.860
Was I picking on him?

00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.140
I was checking if he reached my standard.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.060
What side of him has

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.700
reached your standard?

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.100
He fries good chicken wings.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.420
What?

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.420
Nothing.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.660
He's nowhere near my standard.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.060
Dear me,

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.620
you've really shocked me.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:11.460
I'm leaving, then?

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.060
Mm.

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:17.260
Aren't you gonna have a look at me?

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.380
I thought you could stay

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.300
with me before I went to Beijing.

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.380
I'll go back and check on my mom.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:34.940
If she's okay,

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:36.620
I'll come back in a few days.

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:37.260
For real?

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.060
Yes.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.260
Well, Mrs. Zhao...

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.060
She should be alright.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:43.140
She's just in a bad humor.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.060
That's great.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:45.740
Well,

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.100
off you go now.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:47.980
I'll wait for you.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.380
Go, go, go.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:48.820
I...

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.340
Then I'm off.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.020
Mm.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:52.700
Bye-bye.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:53.260
Come back early.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.100
Bye-bye.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:27.620
Dad,

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.260
mom.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.740
Fanzhou,

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:55.980
sorry.

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.180
Fanzhou,

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:04.380
you've seen it

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.420
over the years.

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.340
I really can't stand her any longer.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:11.780
Yesterday

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.500
I ate with a top executive
of another company.

00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:18.220
Your mom rushed in
and flipped the table over.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.620
(Divorce Settlement)

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.060
I've worked on the deal for over two years

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.900
and it fell through just like that.

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:27.700
Just because I didn't reply

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.220
to her Wechat messages at once.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.380
I've thought about it for a night.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:37.580
Anyway,

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.260
you've grown up

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.460
and we don't wanna keep torturing each other

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:44.780
for your sake anymore.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:52.220
So,

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.020
it's all for my sake?

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.380
That's not what I meant.

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.460
Fanzhou,

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.140
when you were little,

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.620
we were a poor family

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.740
and I worked my guts out

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.780
just to make more money

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.380
and let you have a good life.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.780
Perhaps

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.180
I was too busy with my job

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.700
and neglected both of you.

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.260
At that time,

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.100
your mom had a bad temper,

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:36.380
but I thought

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.700
when we had

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.260
a better life in the future,

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.660
she might

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.300
change.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:44.420
I didn't expect

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:46.540
she would be

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.940
more and more bad-tempered.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.300
It's so terrible

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.740
that even the little family love between us

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.860
was melted away.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.860
I know I'm a bad husband and father.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:06.500
I will

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.580
make amends to you

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.500
in the future.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.180
You don't need to tell me these things.

00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.220
I'll take care of my mom.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:25.260
Fanzhou.

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.420
Off you go.

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.660
Otherwise, if she wakes up,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.500
she'll lose her temper again.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:35.820
Well,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.220
just now when I poured her a glass of water,

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.180
I put some sleeping pills in it.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:45.940
You put sleeping pills in it?

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.580
Fanzhou,

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.780
you didn't see your mom

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.500
being so hysterical.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.580
And that situation

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.940
wasn't normal at all.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.420
I was afraid she would hurt herself

00:44:58.860 --> 00:44:59.500
so...

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.180
When your mom

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.620
was taken here,

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.220
she wasn't badly injured

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:08.780
but she suffered from emotional instability.

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.860
So the doctor

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.100
had to give her a sedative.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.620
Now our psychiatrists

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.140
want to assess her,

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.940
so I came to tell you about it.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.900
She would be given

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.500
a simple assessment tomorrow.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:21.540
Dad,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.700
take mom to hospital.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.860
(Next Episode)
I suggest you take her to Beijing.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.420
The day after tomorrow,

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.620
I'm afraid I can't go to Beijing with you.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.620
I'll go to Beijing by high-speed rail
the day after tomorrow.

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:45.820
You're going to Beijing
the day after tomorrow?

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:46.540
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.380
You said you were at hospital.

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.380
You meant a hospital in Beijing?

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.380
Why didn't you tell me

00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.900
when I said I'd be here for a summer camp?
