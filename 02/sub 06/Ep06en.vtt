<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.560
What is it?

4
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.650
I have something to give you.

5
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.830
Why are you giving me a guitar?

6
00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.080
I was supposed to buy one for you back then. I suddenly remembered that.

7
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.380
You know that I won't accept it.

8
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.850
I know. I know it well, that you won't accept it.

9
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.540
But still, this is a promise from the past, so I thought maybe it would be okay for you to accept it.

10
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.880
But more than that, to be honest

11
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.260
it's because I wanted to see you.

12
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.090
<i>My child and Yeong Min are classmates.</i>

13
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.990
<i>Since his father is here, I'm going to leave.</i>

14
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.520
<i>Han Jae Hyeon</i>

15
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.600
<i>The meeting of an employee and the owner's only daughter, a drama-like love story</i>

16
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.820
It's quite far to your house from the bus stop.
<i>Episode 6</i>

17
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.640
It's okay. I get some exercise.

18
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.030
Is it okay for you to walk around like this? I thought someone was tailing you.

19
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.850
I'm in disguise right now.

20
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.550
It doesn't look like you did anything.

21
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.450
I did.

22
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.890
Dong Jin and I are just like that. We're practically dumb and dumber.

23
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.210
Is Sunbae Dong Jin doing well?

24
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.840
He is well. Breezy as ever, speaking bad English.

25
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.660
I'm telling you to go. 
<i>May, 1994</i>

26
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.270
-  Why are you being like this? 
 - Let go!

27
00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.350
I'm not going.

28
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.660
You crazy guy. Your girlfriend is on a blind date.

29
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.030
How can you demonstrate leisurely?

30
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.910
She just went as a substitute for her friend.

31
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.650
Does being a substitute mean anything? Is she not going to get hit on because she's a substitute?

32
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.820
On top of that, are the guys just ordinary guys?

33
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.970
Are you fitter than them or richer than them?

34
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.430
- You have to wear this at least.
- What is this?

35
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.700
It's pretty.

36
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.220
Am I the DJ of a spicy rice cake restaurant?

37
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.160
You tacky, tacky kid. What would you know about fashion?

38
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.760
For a rock cafe like Space,

39
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.160
do you think you'll be able to get in with this kiddy outfit?

40
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.070
Think about it. Raise this too.

41
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.500
Let's go. You look good.

42
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.280
<i>The Space Rock Cafe</i>

43
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.460
You like basketball, right?

44
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.200
- Yes.
- I really like it.

45
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.010
No.

46
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, what meaning is there to basketball.

47
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.490
- Right?
- Yes.

48
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.090
I also don't like basketball that much.

49
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.100
I guess you don't like sports.

50
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.000
Because of your majors—

51
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.010
No, I like sports.

52
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.630
So you do like sports?

53
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.680
Then what sports do you like?

54
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.820
Student movements. 
<i>(Sports and movements are synonyms in Korean)</i>

55
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.320
What is it?

56
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.800
He says he has something to say.

57
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.500
He is huge.

58
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.920
What do you have to say?

59
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.340
By chance, are you Ji Soo's boyfriend?

60
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.830
No, she's just someone I kno—

61
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.890
He's my husband.

62
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.690
Hey, you're the best, Yoon Ji Soo..

63
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.900
Let's go, sister-in-law.

64
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.130
If I were to go back to the past, that's one of the top three moments that I want to change.

65
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.580
I went walked through Sinchon and the school, and even walked into a Rock Cafe, looking like that.

66
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:25.310
It's the top three, but not number one.

67
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.590
Which moment is the number one moment?

68
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.940
Going to my first protest with a sunbae.

69
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.170
If it weren't for that day, I might not have become a student protester.

70
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.990
Do you regret protesting?

71
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.250
In the end, I couldn't change anything,

72
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:55.780
and while going around protesting, I couldn't even protect the things that were truly important to me.

73
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.200
<i>A civilian government</i>

74
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.780
<i>that suppresses the labor movement needs to awaken! </i>

75
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.830
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

76
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.680
Protect the laborers,

77
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.980
and free those who were arrested.

78
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.600
Free them! Free them!

79
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.890
A civilian government that suppresses labor–

80
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.430
<i> A civilian government that suppresses </i>

81
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.120
<i> labor movement, needs to awaken! </i>

82
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.850
<i> Wake up! Wake up! </i>

83
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.270

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.760
<i> labor movement, needs to awaken! </i>

85
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.310
<i> Abolish it! Abolish it! </i>

86
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.020
<i> A civilian government that suppresses the labor movement ...</i>

87
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.540
<i> Fire! </i>

88
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.200
I won't worry.

89
00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.510
The smart and kind you is doing this,

90
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.600
so it must be for something good.

91
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.730
But even if it isn't for good, that's okay.

92
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.460
Must children only do good to be loved?

93
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.550
On top of that,

94
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.720
you've never done any hateful or bad things.

95
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.880
I'm really okay.

96
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:16.810
Father.

97
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:21.780
- You're back?
- Why are you out here?

98
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.230
To go on a date with my son.

99
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.840
Protesting is not the same as what it used to be, so it's probably uglier.

100
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.170
To be honest, I...

101
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.530
wish you wouldn't do it.

102
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.690
You're doing something good, I know that well.

103
00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:03.600
But I wonder if the world will collapse just because my son doesn't participate in it.

104
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:13.240
You're ashamed of me, right?

105
00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.800
No, Father.

106
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:19.600
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.800
I'm sorry.

108
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.990
You remember everything from the past,

109
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.330
why don't you live like that?

110
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.830
I know right.

111
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.130
I have to return to a place that doesn't have guitars or protests.

112
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.190
Could we be together again?

113
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.450
Even if we are together again, we won't be able to smile together.

114
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:04.960
I'm fighting against people like you.

115
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.230
<i>Mom, Dad found out about the school event.</i>

116
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.140
<i>Several missed calls from Lee Se Hun (her ex-husband)</i>

117
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.410
<i>My son</i>

118
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.520
<i>The person you are trying to call...</i>

119
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.810
<i>Young Min, I'm sorry I just saw your message.</i>

120
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.380
<i>Can you call and let me know what happened?</i>

121
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:09.540
<i>Even if we meet, we won't be able to smile together.</i>

122
00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.630
<i>I'm fighting against people like you.</i>

123
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.850
Why do you call?

124
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.110
I heard what happened. Don't even think of using this incident at school to your benefit.

125
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:35.260
It was just an accident and it's all taken care of now.

126
00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.830
I know. I don't intend to use it.

127
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.010
I'm the kid's dad, not some lowlife.

128
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.310
My heart hurts wondering what led my son to doing such a thing,

129
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.940
and I wonder how much more my son's mother must be hurting.

130
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.840
I know you don't mean it, but keep up the act until the end.

131
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.370
If you change your mind, I won't forgive you.

132
00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.090
Though my words to you are kind, I don't receive kind words.

133
00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.950
His car and clothes changed.

134
00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.040
Looks like he's being followed.

135
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.630
<i> A restaurant part-timer?</i>

136
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.570
Yes. The victim was a regular there, 
 <i>Summer, 2004</i>

137
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.310
but he regularly belittled the survivors.

138
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.170
What did he say?

139
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:30.200
"Beggars" and "Greedy for Money."

140
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.350
So she poured the tray of food on the victim.

141
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.980
All it'll take is a settlement, but the victim insists on pressing charges,

142
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.230
and the woman keeps insisting she'll just go to jail.

143
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.090
<i> Gosh... </i>

144
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.150
If you agree to the settlements, you can be cleared of all charges.

145
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.420
I will not settle.

146
00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.650
If your intent is verified, you could receive a prison sentence.

147
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.730
This incident definitely does not warrant that.

148
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:21.030
It wasn't an accident, or something in the moment.

149
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.730
He belittled the incident, and mocked the survivors.

150
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.760
He showed no signs of remorse or apology.

151
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:33.510
I acted with clear intent.

152
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:39.950
I'm going to tell the world what that person did.

153
00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.980
I understand. I will figure something out.

154
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.620
Here.

155
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:07.810
Being on probation is different from a normal release.

156
00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.270
There are lots of things to be cautious about.

157
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.240
If you make a similar mistake, then you'll really be imprisoned.

158
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.970
You will receive a heavier sentence as well.

159
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.720
It doesn't matter.

160
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.900
I knew you'd be like this.

161
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.650
If I leave you be, you'll the do the same thing a hundred, no a thousand, times over.

162
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.370
I... I like you.

163
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:32.690
I'm not pressing you to do anything now.

164
00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.710
I just know you're struggling a lot right now.

165
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:40.030
Your father is sick, and you don't have anywhere to lean on-

166
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.350
I'll pretend like I didn't hear what you just said.

167
00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.770
If I don't have anyone I can be grateful to, my life will become too dreary.

<i>Hyeong Seong Group Vice President Han Jae Hyeon due for prosecution, risk of arrest. </i>

169
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.660
Joon Seo must be quite big now.

170
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.060
Yes. He's quite big so he's quite good at not listening to me.

171
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.120
You were like that too.

172
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:37.050
Must children do good to be loved? You love them because they're your child.

173
00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.750
I have a long way to go to catch up to you.

174
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.940
What?

175
00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.740
Because he did things that weren't lovely, I didn't adore him.

176
00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:48.030
Oh, goodness. Go ahead and eat.

177
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.200
This is totally broken.

178
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.720
What should I do? I can't do without a radio.

179
00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:59.520
I have one at home, but that one's pretty old too. I don't know if it'll work.

180
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.360
It's fine, forget it then.

181
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:06.180
Mom, should I sing a song for you? One that you like.

182
00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:10.020
Na Hoon A? Jo Yong Pil? Lee Mi Ja?

183
00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.970
What about the song you used to sing a lot?

184
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.870
'Because I Love You'? That one.

185

197
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.420
Mom, this song is too sad.

198
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.490
What do you mean, sad?

199
00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.050
It's saying to never be apart now, since they've met again.

200
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.920
That would be good, but it's not working out so easily.

201
00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:15.810
Jae Hyeon, did you meet her by chance?

202
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.280
Yes.

203
00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.140
Is she doing well?

204
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:23.700
Not really.

205
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.270
Even if she looks pitiful and in pain,

206
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:37.820
even so, you shouldn't do that.

207
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.460
I know.

208
00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:54.120
I used one of my precious days off, and you bring me here again?

209
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.660
I can't say anything about it though, because it's heaven. 
 <i>(Korean chain restaurant called 'Kimbap Heaven')</i>

210
00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.870
I have to eat quickly and head back in.

211
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.070
Have you been online today?

212
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.380
No, why?

213
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.650
Well... someone you know well is on the news.

214
00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:26.100
<i>Search warrant for Hyeong Seong Group, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to be investigated by prosecution</i>

215
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.980
I thought he hit it big when I found out he became the son-in-law of a conglomerate.

216
00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.670
But when I see things like this, I think nothing is for free.

217
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.940
I met him.

218
00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.580
Who?

219
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.590
Sunbae Jae Hyeon.

220
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:45.490
Gosh, how?

221
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:51.710
At Yeong Min's school. His son is in the same class as Yeong Min.

222
00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:57.680
So?

223
00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.900
What, no way.

224
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.730
It's not that, right?

225
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.640
You're not thinking, "let's start again", right?

226
00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:12.350
Hold onto your consciousness.

227
00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.990
Do you know who his father-in-law is?

228
00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:20.200
Okay, say his father-in-law isn't a problem. Did he say he'll get a divorce and throw away all he has?

229
00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:24.470
Fine, say he gets a divorce. What are you going to do about Yeong Min?

230
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:27.930
Is he going to leave his own son who is the same age and live with someone else's son?

231
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.960
You're done eating, right? Let's go.

232
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.620
Even if I were going to eat more, I can't. I lost my appetite.

233
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.070
Hye Jeong.

234
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.660
Don't worry.

235
00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:00.860
How can I not worry?

236
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:05.220
I won't go on the path where I'll get hurt.

237
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:12.190
Okay, if you think you're going to get hurt, attack with your hands first.

238
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.780
That way the other person can't hurt you.

239
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.000
Try it. Practice right now. Like this.

240
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.950
I have to grow out my fingernails first.

241
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.410
Should I tell you a place to grow your fingernails?

242
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:46.400
- Yes, Chairman.
- Where are you?

243
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.310
I'm at my mother's house.

244
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:52.310
- I told Seo Kyeong to go to the villa.
- Okay.

245
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:55.990
This is the first time she's dealing with something like this, so she might not know what to do.

246
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.800
You go and prepare her.

247
00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.720
I understand.

248
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.470
<i>Search warrant for Hyeong Seong Group, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon to be investigated by prosecution</i>

249
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.330
Wait a moment.

250
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:20.310
Oh, Ji Soo. The chief prosecutor is consistently in a good mood.

251
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:24.620
You don't have to worry. He ate well too.

252
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.410
Yes.

253
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.620
He's been working as the social director of the student union since last fall. 
<i>February 1995</i>

254
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.520
He is quite active, as he finally reached this position after four years.

255
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.080
He is also the president of the philosophy circle.

256
00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.370
I think that is where he educated other students about the movement and recruit members as well.

257
00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:45.720
Ji Soo is also involved.

258
00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.060
What about his family?

259
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:50.510
His father works at a steel company in Incheon.

260
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.380
He's part of Roh Joo Won's party in the elections.

261
00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.400
Starting from his family tree, he's not ordinary at all.

262
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.130
His mother is running a small seafood stall in the market.

263
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.750
He's the son of typical poor family, but he's riding the rags-to-riches tide.

264
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:09.550
Ji Soo is caught up with a dangerous guy.

265
00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:13.310
But that student isn't the dangerous type.

266
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.630
Rather, he has a graceful and soft feelin—

267
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:19.020
That's why it'll be harder to get rid of him.

268
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:23.420
There's a power that good-hearted people have.

269
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:27.740
Jae Hyeon Hyung, something bad happened.

270
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:29.180
What happened?

271
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:34.050
The engineering kids were out yesterday, but they found Jae Hyeon's name.

272
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:35.340
Where?

273
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:38.130
On the wanted list.

274
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.270
What is he wanted for all of a sudden? This guy hasn't done anything these days.

275
00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:43.540
Creation of an anti government group.

276
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.820
Hell.

277
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.210
Hey, did you form any new groups?

278
00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:51.030
Then what is it?

279
00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.190
It can't be the student union... could it be the philosophy group?

280
00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.780
Goodness... then won't we get dragged along too?

281
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:01.340
But why would they suddenly do this?

282
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.330
Now that they've caught the student union, they must be checking everything.

283
00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:07.190
They might be snooping into past groups as well.

284
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.040
Is it not here?

285
00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.940
I guess not.

286
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:47.090
The bar exam? You?

287
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.390
It doesn't suit me, right?

288
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:52.190
It's not that, but I thought you had no thoughts of doing it.

289
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.910
I have to make a living.

290
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.290
Can't you do it in Seoul? In like a student dorm... (Cheap Korean apartments typically for students living alone)

291
00:25:57.290 --> 00:26:02.230
I don't have money, and I want to try being in a place without a TV or a PC.

292
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.460
Then, what about me? Can't I go with you there?

293
00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.310
There won't even be a melodeon, not to mention a piano.

294
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:10.990
That's okay. I'll be by your side to cook and do your laundry.

295
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.870
Why would you use those talented hands to cook meals for a guy like me?

296
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.370
It's not as if I'm fighting for the independence of our nation.

297
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:19.920
Then I'll go there every week.

298
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.010
You'll be a nuisance.

299
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:25.410
I'll just go with you now.

300
00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:31.080
I'll contact you when everything is settled.

301
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.560
No matter how remote the place is, wouldn't the radio work?

302
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:42.690
I'm going to study.

303
00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.990
How can a person only study?

304
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:49.340
Listen to it when you're taking a break. You can listen to the movie songs or radio music that you like.

305
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.390
Hey, you wanted criminal!

306
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:16.850
Sorry?

307
00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:18.890
How did you know I'm wanted?

308
00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:23.940
The punks that come here are either poor students or wanted.

309
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.140
You look just like a wanted criminal.

310
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.610
Why? I guess well, don't I?

311
00:27:31.610 --> 00:27:35.930
For your information, I don't like wanted criminals.

312
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:40.230
You have no money, and when I see you get arrested later on,

313
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.060
it just fumbles up my mind.

314
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:50.120
The second I feel you're not fit for this, I'm going to call 112 right away.

315
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.340
Got it?

316
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.710
Yes.

317
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.940
<i>Hyeong Seong Holdings Main Stakeholder List</i>

318
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.040
What's happening with the company now?

319
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.410
What is Jae Hyeon doing these days? They say he isn't going to the office.

320
00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.280
He said he's going on vacation to clear his mind before the prosecution investigation.

321
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:03.430
Did he say that?

322
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:05.800
Why? Is he not doing that?

323
00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.880
I told you...

324
00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.050
everything I inherited from your grandfather

325
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:16.100
I put into borrowed name accounts, right?

326
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.870
Someone must've leaked that information,

327
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:21.030
because prosecutors and the press keep digging around for it.

328
00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.910
I temporarily put it under Jae Hyeon's name

329
00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:26.990
and told him I'd give it to you when things got quiet.

330
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.450
But I think he has different thoughts about it.

331
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.240
Why would he?

332
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.510
How much do you believe in Jae Hyeon?

333
00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:45.420
How can I live if I don't believe him?

334
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.710
I also thought that he was a puppy that listened well

335
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.180
and even acted cute once in a while.

336
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:57.650
But it seems like he's done a lot of preparation for a long time.

337
00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:02.710
What preparation?

338
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.870
Preparation to swallow the company whole.

339
00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.490
Everyone he's meeting right now, are all shareholders.

340
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:16.360
He's meeting the big shareholders who could be on his side to shore up support.

341
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:23.850
And I think he's the one who leaked the borrow name accounts to the press...

342
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:32.200
We need to make him take responsibility for the things he did.

343
00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.290
I know well that Jae Hyeon is the only one for you.

344
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:43.170
But starting now, start letting him go bit by bit.

345
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:52.740
I'll be going now.

346
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.160
Young Min, if something happens again, let me know.

347
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.670
Dad is a lot stronger than Mom.

348
00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.490
Okay?

349
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:07.350
Mom,

350
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.840
I'm about to go to class.

351
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.580
Dad left.

352
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:18.450
Young Min, if something happens, you have to tell me first okay?

353
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.420
Dad just said the same thing to me, to tell him first.

354
00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:28.870
Just do as you want. If you want to tell me, tell me.

355
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:33.530
If you want to tell Dad, tell him. If you don't want to speak, don't tell anyone.

356
00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.260
Well, actually you shouldn't do that...

357
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.260
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

358
00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.510
Here, try some.

359
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.740
Enjoying coffee outdoors. It's a kind of small luxury.

360
00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.800
- It's quite good. 
 - Right?

361
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:29.810
Do you happen to know who that is?

362
00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:36.450
- Why? 
 - He keeps following us.

363
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:38.880
Do you think the Chairman is tailing us?

364
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.270
Probably.

365
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.670
Won't he try to take back all the people we've been trying to win over?

366
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:49.030
It'll be a long battle anyway.

367
00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:13.920
You were still alive. I'm proud of you.

368
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.310
March, 1995.

369
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:26.320
Unbelievably cute, and with a small face.

370
00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.270
It looks just like my Ji Soo.

371
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.280
Jae Hyeon!

372
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.920
How is it here?

373
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:51.510
I like watching the flowers. I hike so well now I was nicknamed the 'flying squirrel'.

374
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:54.260
The monk that looks over me is a comedian.

375
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.570
Quit lying. I know you feel stuffy being here.

376
00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.460
How did you know?

377
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:04.560
The school feels empty without you. The number of people who come out to protest plummeted.

378
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.970
That's embarrassing.

379
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.230
The age of blue blades have passed,

380
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.190
but I'm still running away like some criminal. 
 <i>(Korean saying meaning something dangerous - describes poison on</i>

381
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.940
The blade is still blue, they're just more discreet about it now.

382
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:23.850
How long do you think I'll have to stay here? Until I'm not on the wanted list?

383
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.850
If I stay on that list forever, will I shave my head and become a monk?

384
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.920
Just endure a bit longer.

385
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.880
If you collapse, all the weaker ones will run away.

386
00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.980
You know, Hwa Jin.

387
00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.720
Right now,

388
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:51.210
I don't know when to get off the bike, or where to go

389
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.360
so I'm just pedaling with all my strength.

390
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.390
Because I don't want to fall down.

391
00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.380
We'll be going.

392
00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.010
Yea.

393
00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.460
There's a pay phone near the entrance.

394
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.010
I just bought it, so there's a lot of money on it.

395
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.370
Thanks.

396
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:35.860
Call Ji Soo.

397
00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.110
Do you know what Jae Hyeon's been doing?

398
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.710
Don't you know? He went to study for the bar exam.

399
00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.780
Where did he go?

400
00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.160
A monastery in the mountains.

401
00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.350
At least that part is the truth.

402
00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:07.420
If he knew I told you, he'd get so angry...

403
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.210
He's on the run right now.

404
00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:15.870
Why?

405
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:18.260
He got put on the wanted list recently.

406
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.480
- Why? 
 - What do you mean why? He must've done something wrong.

407
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.490
What would he have done wrong?

408
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.800
Creation of an anti government group.

409
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.190
But Ji Soo, it's weird no matter how I look at it.

410
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.990
He's not the one who created the philosophy group.

411
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.410
Sure, he made the movie group, but it's not that type of group at all.

412
00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:42.680
And the student union is totally legal, so they can't arrest him for that...

413
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:49.340
You're telling me this for a reason, right?

414
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:53.090
You really are smart.

415
00:36:54.100 --> 00:37:00.740
I'm hoping that's not it... but your father does have that kind of job...

416
00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:06.320
You did it, right?

417
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.990
Putting Jae Hyeon on the wanted list.

418
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.420
He didn't do anything that warrants an arrest.

419
00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.030
What do I have to do?

420
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.320
It's called an 'opportunity cost.'

421
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:33.290
You can't have everything in life.

422
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:39.560
If you choose one, you must give up another.

423
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.360
Make the right decision.

424
00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.410
You can do what you want to do most,

425
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.440
or avoid what you dread the most.

426
00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.440
If you promise to not meet Han Jae Hyeon again,

427
00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.290
I will release him from the wanted list.

428
00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.860
If you keep meeting him, I will arrest him

429
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:13.980
and make him rot in the cells for years.

430
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.600
You can live while taking care of him in prison.

431
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.090
Not as Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter Yoon Ji Soo, but as Han Jae Hyeon's woman Yoon Ji Soo.

432
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.890
Instead of grasping onto both like a greedy young child and crying out of pity for yourself,

433
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.560
give up one or the other!

434
00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:36.870
Give up Han Jae Hyeon, or give up being Yoon Hyeong Goo's daughter!

435
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.600
"Ride the bike. You're going down your own path now."

436
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.520
This is the last line in the movie 'Running on Empty'.

437
00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:38.550
At times, like that father. At times, like River Phoenix, the son.

438
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:44.130
"I want to send these words to my lover, who is struggling alone.

439
00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.090
I want to tell Sunbae to go down his own path now."

440
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.690
One of our listeners sent us this story.

441
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:56.830
The song they requested is 'Goodbye' by Kim Chang Wan.

442
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:09.560
♫ <i>Goodbye, my cute friend. </i> ♫

443
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:17.520
♫ <i>When you hear the ship's horn from faraway,</i> ♫

444
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:25.970
♫ <i>will you for me, without anyone knowing</i> ♫

445
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:32.040
♫ <i>in the room alone, while everyone else sleeps.</i> ♫

446
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:39.750
♫ <i>Goodbye, my small love.</i> ♫

447
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:47.530
♫ <i>When the stars twinkle from far away,</i> ♫

448
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:56.240
♫ <i>you should say, so no one can hear you</i> ♫

449
00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.290
♫ <i>that you went far away, as you cry</i> ♫

450
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.930
A client gave it to us, but there isn't anyone who will ride a women's bicycle.

451
00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:10.120
I don't believe that.

452
00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.420
I also said that you definitely wouldn't believe it.

453
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:16.370
But he just loaded it in the car and pounded it, telling me to go.

454
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.400
He said that you always drop things when you go grocery shopping, so you should put them into the basket.

455
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.490
And if you keep carrying heavy things, it's not good for your hands.

456
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:27.620
Please take it away.

457
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:31.720
This can't be refunded, and if I take it back, I'm going to be fired for sure.

458
00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.960
It's hard to find jobs these days, just think of it as doing a good deed and accept it.

459
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.150
And you know that it's a waste of money if you don't use it, right?

460
00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.720
<i>I'm Yoon Ji Soo's ex-husband, Lee Se Hoon.</i>

461
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:05.420
<i>I have something to discuss with you. Can we meet?</i>

462
00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.400
Why did you send this to me?

463
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.330
If you're trying to get money, you should have sent it to my husband.

464
00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:21.120
Although I don't know if such a scenic photo will work as a threat.

465
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.140
I'm not here to threaten you. I'm here to ask for your cooperation.

466
00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.350
I must seem easy, since we've been all over the news.

467
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:32.860
Cows and dogs are trying to barge in.

468
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.200
It's not because you seem easy.

469
00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.480
I'm here because it appears that we have the same goal.

470
00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.620
I hate it when people beat around the bush.

471
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:44.680
I heard you put a tail on your husband.

472
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.950
So?

473
00:42:46.950 --> 00:42:53.330
I want to get my wife back, and you want to get your husband back.

474
00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.210
Isn't that right?

I thought you wouldn't use the school incident.

481
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.080
I changed my mind.

482
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.240
You do this and still insist you aren't a lowlife?

483
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.670
He had thoughts of dying, and what did you do about it?

484
00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.600
When that innocent child picked up and threw a chair, there was obviously something wrong.

485
00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.060
Did you bow your head and kneel in front of them without finding out the cause?

486
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:18.010
Did you want to move on from it because it was your old lover's son?

487
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:44.490
Does someone who left their child alone in a rural area to enjoy romance in Seoul

488
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:47.230
have the right to raise a child?

489
00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:54.710
Isn't it your greed to keep both child custody and love?

490
00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:01.990
Give up your custody. I'm being considerate of you.

491
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:06.630
It'll be hard since he's married, but try and do well with him.

492
00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:17.000
Whether I date, get married, or die alone, I will raise Yeong Min.

493
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.500
I won't leave him to grow up as a monster under your care.

494
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.020
Then, let's fight properly.

495
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:41.820
What's so serious that you can't even have a drink?

496
00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.120
- Ji Soo.
- You graduated from law school, right?

497
00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.580
Do you know any lawyers?

498
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.530
Are you not going to tell me what's wrong?

499
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:02.240
I received a notice for return of child custody from Yeong Min's dad.

500
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:06.780
Why all of a sudden? What did he say?

501
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.630
Yeong Min's school violence issue.

502
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:12.640
Is he saying you don't have the right to custody because the kids fought a bit?

503
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:16.960
Even though I didn't practice law, I do know the basics.

504
00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.630
No matter how good the lawyer is, you'll win that case.

505
00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.220
He's saying I'm committing adultery.

506
00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.150
You—

507
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:32.830
By chance, is it Jae Hyeon hyung?

508
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.160
No way, there's no way it's true.

509
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.990
There's some sort of misunderstanding, right?

510
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:53.000
He has a picture of us together.

511
00:46:54.890 --> 00:47:00.960
But Yeong Woo, if having my heart shaken is adultery,

512
00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.420
then I can't say it's not true.

513

<i>Sunbae Jae Hyeon</i>

514

Why did you want to do something like this?

515
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.240
I saw it on TV and it looked fun.

516
00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:57.180
You leave a house as big as a whale and sleep in a tent the size of a booger?

517
00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.830
Also, do you call this food?

518
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:02.790
It's better than anything from a 5-star hotel.

519
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.260
Why are you being like this?

520
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.870
I feel bad about him always playing by himself.

521
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:08.960
- Dad.
- Yea?

522
00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.770
This is burning. Flip it, quickly!

523
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.830
It burned a lot.

524
00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:18.060
- Will we be able to eat it?
- Of course.

525
00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:49.090
If you use what I give you in a different way, I won't stay still.

526
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:50.510
Of course.

527
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:55.360
I'm only thinking of using it for our mutual goal.

528
00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.660
You can consider it camaraderie, or say that misery loves company.

529
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:07.360
It seems like both you and I are in pitiful love.

530
00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.680
Everything we're doing is out of love, in a way.

531
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:13.800
You're funny.

532
00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.260
You think what you're doing is out of love?

533
00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.860
It doesn't seem that way to me at all.

534
00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.100
I've been keeping tabs with the news that involves you

535
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.450
on the internet and the news.

536
00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:42.750
I'm pretty sure there wasn't anything positive, but how are things with you?

537
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:47.380
I quit the company and set up an LP bar.

538
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.600
That's quite romantic.

539
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.040
Well I don't have a family, so it's just something to pay the bills.

540
00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:57.750
You didn't marry?

541
00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.980
Is there a specific reason why?

542
00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.920
Things just happened that way.

543
00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.700
It seems I'm only mentioning topics that may make you feel uncomfortable  when we haven't seen each other in a while.

544
00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:16.160
Actually, it's my turn to say something uncomfortable.

545
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.670
I was the one who did it that time.

546
00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:25.000
Reporting you to the police, on April Fool's Day.

I'm here.

549
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:37.150
But Hyung, will you be okay? I saw a lot of police there.

550
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.360
That's why I'm going to go around in a car.

551
00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.930
But, where are you going?

552
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:45.820
To Ji-soo.

553
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:59.140
<i>Ji-soo was having such a hard time going between you and her father</i>

554
00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:01.740
<i>but you looked so carefree.</i>

555
00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:08.980
Even so, Ji-soo never thought about herself and always thought about you.

556
00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:13.040
I got angry and jealous.

557
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.460
So why are you telling me all this now?

558
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.840
I want to be more upfront with you.

559
00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:26.200
That way I can criticize you and also ask you for favors too.

560
00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:31.130
I already knew that you were the one who reported to the police, Yeong-woo.

561
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:37.560
So that is why you don't have to be sorry. Just tell me.

562
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.750
So how are you feeling today?

563
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.570
Would you like to criticize me or ask something of me?

564
00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.870
Both.

565
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.830
Give up on the custody battle.

566
00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:02.820
Legal action hasn't been taken yet.

567
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.340
If you don't give up, Han Jae Hyeon will take a big fall.

568
00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.690
Open it, it'll be interesting.

569
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:46.290
If you give up custody, this video will disappear from the world.

570
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:49.010
If you don't give up custody,

571
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:54.990
while Han Jae Hyeon is being investigated by the prosecutors, this video will be released to the world.

I'm not going to see you anymore.

I'm sorry for lying.

Whether you lied or not, this isn't going to work.

578

- Ji Soo.
- To be honest, I can't handle it either.

<i>Do you acknowledge all charges?</i>

597
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:41.210
I guess you thought really hard about it, seeing how your face is sunken.

598
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:45.700
After that day, I kept thinking about it.

599
00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:49.580
About why you are being like this.

600
00:56:50.990 --> 00:56:55.670
You were someone who had extramarital affairs before Yeong Min even learned how to walk.

601
00:56:55.670 --> 00:57:00.650
You also gave up custody without a second thought in court.

602
00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.390
Why are you suddenly talking about the right to custody?

603
00:57:06.550 --> 00:57:13.060
If you suddenly developed a love for your son after giving way a hundred times,

604
00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:17.250
then you would have brought up my affair and incompetence in court to win.

605
00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:20.290
But why is the effort to get your son back

606
00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:24.300
less than the effort to ruin the person I'm having an affair with?

607
00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:31.830
How could your child's custody and the man Han Jae Hyeon be put on the same level?

608
00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.090
Did you find the answer to that?

609
00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:41.180
There's something my dad told me 25 years ago.

610
00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.790
About opportunity cost.

611
00:57:45.460 --> 00:57:51.100
If you choose one, you have to give up the other one.

612
00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:58.810
Either you pick what you want to do most, or you avoid what you dread the most.

613
00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:01.840
To pick one of the two.

614
00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.710
So?

615
00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.580
I...

616
00:58:09.640 --> 00:58:12.570
decided to avoid what I dread the most.

617
00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.160
Back then and now,

618
00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:23.670
the thing I'm most afraid of

619
00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.730
is that person getting ruined because of me.

620
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:36.900
