00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.040
Just as I will arrive for work at 8:00 a.m.,

15
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.150
I hope you guys will make sure to come home from work at 7:00 p.m.

16
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.560
I charge overtime even if you're just 10 minutes late.

17
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.000
I do not work on the weekends.

Whether it's a baby massage or top-quality baby food,

19
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.310
if you want a premium service, you just have to pay an extra 30,000 won.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.600
Do you have any questions?

21
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.890
If we're late even once,

22
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.760
- we'll be bankrupt. 
 - Stop.

23
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.440
If we get off work early, do you discount your day's pay?

24
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.150
Oh my goodness, you guys are a married couple? Oh my!

25
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.400
You weren't homeless!

26
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.480
But is that child from back then the second?

27
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.080
Remarriage! Oh my, oh my. Did you guys cheat?

28
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.770
Oh my, oh my. You two... Did they really cheat?

29
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.790
Oh my! Oh my.

30
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.290
Teacher, I'll meet you at aerobics!

31
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.200
Go safely!

32
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.600
Do you know them?

33
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.580
Let's act like a married couple.

34
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.240
I'm so tired.

35
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.190
It's not simple getting a babysitter. What are you going to do with the opening coming soon?

36
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.820
Well, I'll leave the kid at the daycare center till 3:00 p.m. and then take her to the hospital.

37
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.290
How do you know those crazy women?

38
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.420
How do you know them?

39
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.470
I don't even want to talk about it.

40
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.910
Hari, Hari, Jang Hari? What are you going to do now?

41
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.450
Shall we have fun together as we prepare for the hospital opening?

42
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.760
Don't say nonsense. If you're going to make me work, then pay me part-time.

43
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.790
It's not easy.

44
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.980
Hello.

45
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.010
Oh, come in! This is our schedule for today.

46
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.360
<i>10:00 a.m.: Sanghee - Yeonho </i>

47
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.150
<i>10:00 a.m.: Yisang - Hari </i>

48
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.600
Jang Hari is doing a photoshoot?

49
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.730
She's so diligent, it's scary.

50
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.890
Suspension at work means not to be seen in front of the CEO.

51
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.830
<i>I came!</i>

52
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.800
What kind of photoshoot is this?

53
00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.700
It's too obvious.

54
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.270
It's an article about children having friends of a different gender.

55
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.740
Oh! You scared me. Why?!

56
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.500
I'm s-sorry.

57
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.260
I-it wasn't supposed to be you today?

58
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.860
I told Hari not to come since I can do this shoot.

59
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.950
Sanghee knows how to do baby food shoots well on his own, because we do them every month.

60
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.180
She wouldn't feel like working when she got suspended.

61
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.990
I told her not to even think about coming this way or even show the tip of her nose here.

62
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.830
You're so uselessly supportive of her.

63
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.000
What?

64
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.160
Wh-What do we need to film?

65
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.250
He's such a weird man.

66
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.460
We need a full shot like this, from the front.

67
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.880
Leave some space at the top for the title.

68
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.500
He's so transparent.

69
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.200
Make sure you leave space on the top for the title.

70
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.240
I understand.

71
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.790
A little...

72
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.340
I'll do it on my own.

73
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.530
<i>[Episode 5: When we want to believe in fate</i>]

74
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.430
Mom!

75
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.480
W-What's the occasion?

76
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.350
Hello.

77
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.550
Hello.

78
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.950
Why are you treating me like some kind of patient?

79
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.800
You are a patient.

80
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.160
You must eat something smooth for your digestion to work well.

81
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.550
Is being a guitarist your dream? Why do it till you get an injury?

82
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.000
It's because I've done a lot of restaurant work.

83
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.640
The arthritis came back just because I flicked a few guitar strings.

84
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.660
You should take it easy. Do you have a deep resentment toward not being able to play?

85
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.140
Of course, I do.

86
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.670
I've always wanted to play the Spanish Romance.

87
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.400
But I got hooked by your father, so all I managed to play was the Edelweiss.

88
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.450
Damn it. When I fell head over heels,

89
00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.290
it blinded me from being able to see what was real and what wasn't.

90
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.050
But you seem to have luck late in life, don't you think?

91
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.080
We found the cancer in its beginning stages,

92
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.220
and you have the ease to do all the things you want.

93
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.550
What can you do with more time and money when your body won't listen to you?

94
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.860
How nice would it be to try everything I couldn't do because of work and lack of money before I die?

95
00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.240
I know. You should do everything while you can.

96
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.910
That's why I'm trying to have a baby.

97
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.040
I only have a few eggs left.

98
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.990
But because I have endometriosis, they said it'll be hard to give birth after surgery.

99
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:15.800
But it's not serious.

100
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.420
Right now... Are you talking about yourself?

101
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.820
I can just have a kid, and then get surgery to fix the endometriosis. It's not a big deal.

102
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.510
It's getting cold. Hurry and eat.

103
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.520
Hurry and eat. It's getting cold.

104
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.020
You're going to do artificial insemination by yourself? Did I hear wrong or are you crazy?

105
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.360
I already told you that I gave up on marrying. I'm only going to give birth to a baby.

106
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.500
Oh my. You really must be crazy.

107
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.730
I think I'm going to keep being crazy.

108
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.520
Can't you just take my side?

109
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.220
Is this a matter of you buying green onions or some water?

110
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.130
How can I support you when you're trying to buy sperm?

111
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:11.520
I'm not buying it ... I'm going to get them to agree and cooperate. Be quiet.

112
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.460
Friend, Hari, I really don't think that's it.

113
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.890
I think it's right.

114
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:22.470
Hey! So you're just going to have a kid?

115
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:26.110
It's hard to raise a child even with a husband, but alone?

116
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.460
Okay. Let's say you can raise the baby alone.

117
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.320
But then... what if a good person appears?

118
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.390
Don't you think that having suffered for 20 years already with that kind of hope is enough?

119
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.460
I have no lingering thoughts about men.

120
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.600
My dear friend, instead of shutting off your heart, why don't you look again at men you've rejected before,

121
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.970
and try hitting on men you've already hit on before.

122
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:52.360
People you never thought of as anything more than a friend could suddenly seem like a man.

123
00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:55.630
Search well. There are so many good men out there.

124
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.370
Who? Do you know any?

125
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.360
Oh, yeah. My brother-in-law. You know, right?

126
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.710
He cooks breakfast every morning before he leaves for work,

127
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:08.700
he drops the kids off for school, goes on an overseas trip every year,

128
00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.600
and he only thinks about my sister.

129
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.170
That's right. Your brother-in-law is really thoughtful.

130
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:19.150
Yeah, he must have come to buy groceries with your sister.

131
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.780
That's your brother-in-law, right?

132
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.520
Did your sister lose weight? Her S-line body, wow—

133
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.980
Hey, who's that young person?

134
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:34.150
You should go first.

135
00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.350
Eunyoung, that... picture of evidence!

136
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.130
I mean... gather the evidence!

137
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.820
Brother-in-Law.

138
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:47.730
Who is this girl?

139
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:53.910
You... have the wrong person.

140
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.100
Brother-in-Law!  You are my brother-in-law!

141
00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.680
Brother-in-law!

142
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.320
<i> I'm not your brother-in-law!</i>

143
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.950
Her poor sister, goodness.

144
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.330
- I said I'm not your brother-in-law! 
 - Brother-in-law!

145
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.210
Brother-in-law!

146
00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.930
- I said I'm not your brother-in-law!
<i> - You are my brother-in-law, Jung Joonyoung!</i>

147
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:22.010
<i>No, I'm not!</i>

148
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.190
<i>Eunyoung was against marriage, and used to think it foolish of me to dream of marriage. </i>

149
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.270
<i>She was preparing to launch a start-up as an app developer.</i>

150
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.990
<i>She went to earn an investment from an investment company</i>

151
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:39.030
<i>and turned her life around. </i>

152
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.630
<i>The sudden relationship soon became a marriage and a pregnancy.</i>

153
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:49.590
<i>Eunyoung had the confidence to be a working mom; something that superwoman couldn't even do.</i>

154
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:52.520
<i>She had no idea she would have pre-eclampsia</i>

155
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.300
<i>and give birth to premature twins.</i>

156
00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:02.860
<i>Who knew that she who dreamed of becoming a successful venture capitalist would put her life on the line to give birth?</i>

157
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:07.240
<i>Who knew she would go and catch her cheating brother-in-law while out grocery shopping?</i>

158
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.720
<i>After living for 39 years, I learned:</i>

159
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:14.060
<i>Good things won't happen out of the blue.</i>

160
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.090
<i>But bad things will hit you from behind without a warning.</i>

161
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:21.260
<i>If you don't do anything, nothing will happen.</i>

162
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.740
<i>So, I should at least do something.</i>

163
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.650
Yoon Jaeyoung.

164
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.800
Objectively speaking, he has so many good qualities that would be good to have.

165
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.100
If I ask him to give it to me...

166
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.160
He'd probably curse.

167
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.100
<i>[Sperm Donation Candidate #2] Yoon Jaeyoung</i>

168
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:51.620
Han Yisang. See, he's not bad.

169
00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.980
More importantly,

170
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.390
he's kind of cool.

171
00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.140
Why am I smiling? He's not going to give it.

172
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:05.730
<i>[Potential Sperm Donor Number 3] Han Yisang</i>

173
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.270
Choikang Eutteum.

174
00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.390
As expected...

175
00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:20.850
<i>[Potential Sperm Donor Number 1]</i>

176
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.920
Really?

177
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.630
Mr. Eutteum, come here.

178
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:37.300
Yes? Yes.

179
00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:42.640
This, this. How could you write it like this?

180
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.190
These proposals should be strong and captivating!

181
00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.020
As soon as the client sees this, with their eyes popping out, should be going

182
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.400
"Wow, I should definitely do an advertisement here."

183
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.320
<i>- I said to seduce them! 
 - He can't even do it himself.</i>

184
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.640
Why can't you do this one right no matter how much I teach you?

185
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.690
I'll write it again.

186
00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.230
After acting like you learn so quickly!

187
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.590
Damn it.

188
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.610
How are you going to survive in this office?

189
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:13.640
Mr. Eutteum.

190
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.420
The next is a O-X quiz.

191
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.400
O-X? I'm confident.

192
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.520
A man donated his sperm.

193
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.370
Can this sperm be given to only one infertile couple? Yes or no?

194
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.110
Choi Kang Eutteum! X!

195
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.390
- Correct. 
 - Yes!

196
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:44.010
If we submit a proposal of a campaign to donate sperm at a infertility clinic...

197
00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:46.690
Is it because it's a topic you're interested in?

198
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:49.210
Let's say that's true.

199
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.790
Between listing all the advantages of an ad in a magazine versus

200
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.650
doing a learning quiz like we just did, what do you think would be more effective?

201
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.910
- Learning quiz! 
 - Correct!

202
00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.470
That's how you should write proposals.

203
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.480
Come up with a concept the client may be interested in and make a magazine ad or video using it.

204
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.250
While also consulting with reporters.

205
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:13.750
You're like an all-knowing lecturer.

206
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:15.930
Hmm!

207
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.870
Hari came.

208
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.860
Why? Did something happen?

209
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:28.860
She's doing something secretly with Eutteum.

210
00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.430
With Eu-Eutteum?

211
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:32.290
What for?!

212
00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.210
They went to the conference room, so they're probably having a meeting.

213
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.330
Fuzzy... my eyes are fuzzy 
 <i>(T/N: sounds like "what for")</i>

214
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.380
I looked at the screen for too long.

215
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:50.180
- Seungho, can you air out the room? 
 - Yes!

216
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.340
Um...

217
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:05.130
After listening, what do you think? About donating sperm?

218
00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.190
Not a proposal but a sperm donation?

219
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:15.540
No... well... I was curious about whether the explanation was effective.

220
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.970
But... even though you want to receive it, you can't.

221
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.320
Because you're single.

222
00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:30.200
I'm trying to find a solution. Without breaking the law.

223
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:37.730
Ah, but... what if the child is curious about the dad?

224
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.740
That's why I'm trying to get consent.

225
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.260
That if the child is curious about the dad, whether I can tell them. Or...

226
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:51.890
if the child wants to meet, whether he can meet.

227
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.020
To the donor?

228
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.120
Yes.

229
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:04.920
Before that, I probably should tell the child in such a way that they would understand.

230
00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.260
Mom wanted to meet you so much,

231
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.530
that I asked a nice man for a favor.

232
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:20.460
That just because he let you be born doesn't make him a dad.

233
00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.520
It's not because he didn't love you,

234
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:28.280
it's because he and I weren't in love.

235
00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:36.570
I'm so confident that I can love the child,

236
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.300
but it wouldn't be enough for the child. Right?

237
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.290
If it's your child,

238
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.860
I think they'll like it a lot that you're their mom.

239
00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.860
Thanks.

240
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.840
The biological dad...

241
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.720
needs to have good healthy genes.

242
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.130
Right. How do we find out?

243
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.650
Then...

244
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.680
Eutteum, you must have finished the proposal if you're just sitting here.

245
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.620
Ah, you didn't take the health exam yet, right? Make sure to get it by this week.

246
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.660
- Okay, I understand. 
 - Me too!

247
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.410
I need to get it, too.

248
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.270
I'm gonna get it.

249
00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:02.990
- Are you going? 
 - Yeah.

250
00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.520
Bro!

251
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.000
Why? Why? What?

252
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:24.250
Shall we?

253
00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.720
What are we eating?

254
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.000
My goodness.

255
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.680
Have you not forgotten about Inah?

256
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.330
Why are you suddenly asking?

257
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:37.830
Just because.

258
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:41.740
I'm just wondering if you aren't meeting anybody who you have feelings for because you can't forget about her.

259
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.760
I'm not meeting anyone because I'm comfortable being alone.

260
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:46.880
To be honest, you're jealous of me.

261
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.710
I'm so jealous.

262
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.200
I worried a lot for you guys.

263
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.690
You guys, during the MT (retreat) the first year at where was that? Oh yeah.

264
00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:02.070
At Daesungri. You two snuck out and did this...

265
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.600
When you guys got caught kissing by me!

266
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:09.730
Starting from then, I watched you guys for seventeen years.

267
00:19:09.730 --> 00:19:12.230
Your memory is so good.

268
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:17.630
Since two people who were doing well without any problems suddenly split up,

269
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.150
I didn't feel good.

270
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.720
Since you were hurting so much, I couldn't get to ask.

271
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.130
But why did you guys break up?

272
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.680
<i>Why is it here again?</i>

273
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.040
<i>Would it be good to put it somewhere more accessible?</i>

274
00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.090
<i>Inah.</i>

275
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.070
<i>That was always there.</i>

276
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.090
<i>There's no change.</i>

277
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.830
<i>At all.</i>

278
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.990
<i>What do you mean?</i>

279
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.250
<i>Everything changed.</i>

280
00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.200
<i>The trivial everyday life that we used to enjoy together.</i>

281
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.460
<i>We started to hate the habits that we liked.</i>

282
00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.390
It got tiring.

283
00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.070
Because you think it'll be like that again,

284
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.040
you're living alone?

285
00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.600
Try and meet another good person. They might be different.

286
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.150
Bro,

287
00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.270
it's a problem that people who were in love for 17 years couldn't overcome.

288
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:05.130
Why should I make someone I like to deal with my problem?

289
00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.550
I can just deal with it myself.

290
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:13.930
Oh geez...

291
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.930
♪ I have to buy more alcohol ♪

292
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.620
Huh?

293
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.540
Han Yisang!

294
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.260
You saw me, right?

295
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.300
I saw you.

296
00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:45.570
Did you pretend you didn't see me?

297
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.800
Yes. That's right.

298
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.540
Why?

299
00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:53.410
Can't I do things my way?

300
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:57.790
You're drunk, aren't you?

301
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.540
Yes, yes, yes. Correct!

302
00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.660
Oh no... What are we going to do?

303
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:11.230
Wow... this is crazy.

304
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.830
Why do you keep following me?

305
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.870
Because the park is round. So is the earth.

306
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.040
Since the earth is round, if we keep walking, then we'll eventually meet.

307
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.930
- You're drunk, aren't you? 
 - How low do you think my tolerance is...

308
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:50.130
Drunkard Han Yisang, can you find your house well?

309
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.790
Who do you think I am?

310
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.840
But... Why did I do well?

311
00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.160
What?

312
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:12.480
I mean, to be exact, what... where...

313
00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.920
How did I do well?

314
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.960
You...

315
00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.610
did well with your height, your face,

316

Well, even if you want to scare me, I won't get scared. I'll leave now.

No. We're going to keep on being separated from now, so she needs to accept the reality.

Of course, you can't compare sperm donation with blood donation.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:29.830
Hari can't even ride an airplane well.

474
00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:32.930
That's true. She's suspended so she can't go anyway.

475
00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.330
She definitely won't go because she's having fun.

476
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.150
I, who has been having fun due to getting suspended, will go.

477
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.420
I can't go.

478
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.950
What is it now?

479
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.960
I embarrassed myself in front of Jang Hari...

480
00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.840
No way...

481
00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.120
Did you pretend to be cute?

482
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:16.370
How are you going to face her now?!

483
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:22.970
I'm so embarrassed I could die, but I'll try to endure it.

484
00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.420
They said it's an important photoshoot.

485
00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:29.620
I need to go, but my arm is hurt!

486
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.890
I'm not able to earn any money cause of this arm, so I can't even use a freelancer!

487
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:35.650
Ah, I really...

488
00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:36.820
Let's close up the studio.

489
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.960
Stop it. I can't face Jang Hari anymore.

490
00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.190
Ah, take care of it!

491
00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:55.410
Chief, I haven't heard from the photographer yet. It's not like he didn't see it, right?

492
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:57.290
He must be somewhere there.

493
00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.550
<i>He's your partner. Search well.</i>

494
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.160
What? My partner?

495
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.170
What partner?

496
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.040
I found him.

497
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.820
Should we get going?

498
00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:36.790
If you were assigned, you should have told me. It would have been nice to come together!

499
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:38.200
Do you want to eat this?

500
00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.140
Well.

501
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:42.930
What about octopus grilled in butter? Beef jerky?

502
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.830
I don't like any of them.

503
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.880
Can you go and drink some alcohol and come back? You were sincere and cute then.

504
00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.840
<i>Can I not do it my way?</i>

505
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.020
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

506
00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.600
<i>Correct</i>

507
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.490
We're not going on a trip for fun.

508
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:01.690
A trip is a trip.

509
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:05.340
If we're going on a trip, we should buy some things to eat and have a good time.

510
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.620
I have to take an airplane.

511
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.930
I'm going crazy, an airplane...

512
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.370
We're... not... going on a trip to-together.

513
00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.600
So you're not going to eat?

514
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.630
Maybe you're getting too...

515
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:40.200
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

516
00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.470
<i>We sincerely welcome you.</i>

517
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:47.230
<i>Our staff will be working hard to make sure you all have a safe and comfortable flight. </i>

518
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.070
Are you okay?

519
00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.910
I have a fear of take-offs.

520
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:54.040
Once it takes off, I'll be fine. It's quick.

521
00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.240
Your body isn't feeling bad or anything, right?

522
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.290
No.

523
00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.230
Hello.

524
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:14.030
Hello.

525
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:18.820
Where's Hari?

526
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.250
She went on a business trip to Mureung with Han Yisang.

527
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:30.210
To the far away Mureung, with no other staff, just the two of them?

528
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.040
Together, far away...

529
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:40.920
I mean, what are they doing that it's only the two of them?

530
00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:44.490
What kind of dog-like situation is this?

531
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.020
<i>Everyone, the "fasten seatbelt" sign has been turned off.</i>

532
00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:55.520
<i>However, because there are moments of sudden movement, we advise</i>

533
00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.770
<i>that you keep your seatbelts on while in your seats.</i>

534
00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:00.410
<i>In the case that the seatbelt signal turns off...</i>

535
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:04.790
♫ <i>Every day I find a light to make me shine</i> ♫

536
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.260
Oh! Oh my goodness.

537
00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.780
Sir, are you okay?

538
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:15.740
♫ <i>A sensation of falling in love</i> ♫

539
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.410
♫ <i>You take me up</i> ♫

548
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:05.100
<i>A person who suddenly seems like a man...</i>

549
00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:10.430
<i>Is it this guy? The bus I missed...</i>

550
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:13.390
<i>It always happens on days when you're late for important meetings; </i>

551
00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:15.890
<i>strangely, the bus doesn't come.</i>

552
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.610
<i>If you get into a taxi to get there a little more quickly, the traffic is bad;</i>

553
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:25.370
<i>and right as you get upset, the bus you were waiting for flashes by in the lane next to you.</i>

554
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:31.470
<i>If this time, my impatience takes over and if I miss the connection that was coming my way... </i>

555
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:38.300
<i>will I later regret not grabbing this person's hand?</i>

556
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.640
Why isn't this opening?

557
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.470
Why—

558
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:03.860
...does this open well? They made it well.

559
00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:05.990
Do you want to drink this?

560
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:07.590
No.

561
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.170
Driver...

562
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.940
Thank you.

563
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:25.060
Wait... Not my hand, but the handkerchief.

564
00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:28.530
Yeah, the handkerchief.

565
00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.720
- What? 
 - Hari,

566
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.800
should I take the picture with my gown or without it?

567
00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.430
Why are you asking me about taking off your clothes? There's a reporter there.

568
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:49.220
What? Both look cool.

569
00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.390
Stop joking, it's embarrassing

570
00:45:51.390 --> 00:45:53.950
Okay, then shall I take it with it on or off?

571
00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.770
Taking it off or not, do whatever you want.

572
00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:03.470
It's better if I wear it? Okay, work hard.

573
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.760
It looks cooler if I wear it.

574
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:13.480
Was it Yoon Jaeyoung?

575
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.190
Yes.

576
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.040
Why do you keep calling me?

577
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.960
Shall I get my picture taken sitting down or standing up?

578
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.170
<i>Wouldn't it be nice if I stand by the window looking cool?</i>

579
00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:31.640
No, I think it's better if I sit to show the nameplate.

580
00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.340
Sit down and cover your belly.

581
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:40.860
Oh, fine. Okay. Work hard.

582
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.710
Let's start.

583
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.600
Why? What? Why, what, what?

584
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.630
Shall I take it smiling or without?

585
00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:59.990
<i>It would be nice to not smile, right? For a more serious and professional vibe.</i>

586
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.200
No, actually I think smiling is better. Since it's a local hospital,

587
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.300
wouldn't it be nice to go for a more friendly approachable vibe?

588
00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.990
Just shut up and take it, you watermelon bastard.

589
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.880
You think I'm charming?

590
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.820
Stop it, Hari.

591
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.230
Doctor,

592
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.230
you're going to come out this small.

593
00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.870
It's not easy.

594
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:44.740
'Mureung' means there are no tombs here. They planted fake tombs here to trick enemies of the King's tomb.

595
00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:49.810
There's a legend that a dragon ascended from those fake tombs made here.

596
00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:53.090
That's only a legend, is it not?

597
00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:55.550
- Take it comfortably. 
 - Okay.

598
00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:58.660
♫ <i>I want to wait for you slowly</i> ♫

599

600
00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.290
I think it'll be fine.

612
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.270
Okay, so with this, we've come to the end of our official schedule for today.

613
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.200
Those who want to keep taking pictures can.

614
00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:47.130
If you want to spend more time here, you can.

615
00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.760
You guys worked hard.

616
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.150
Thank you.

617
00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.980
Jang Hari, isn't the end kind of regretful?

618
00:48:56.980 --> 00:49:01.200
Right? Should we take a picture of someone at the ocean?

619
00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.960
Hari, didn't come yet?

620
00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:11.260
She went to Mureung. She'll probably come late at night.

621
00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.300
Eat some food.

622
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.730
Aunt, the photographer is a man.

623
00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:17.810
What if something happens with the man?

624
00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:20.600
What would?

625
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.680
A scary thing!

626
00:49:29.130 --> 00:49:33.540
But I wonder if we should be renting a car for one shot...

627
00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.630
You said it was a piece that your pride is riding on.

628
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:41.090
It's a "Photo By Han Yisang." My pride is riding on this, too.

629
00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:45.830
Even if I said I didn't want to, I'd never not do my best.

630
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.780
I know.

631
00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:53.010
Do we have enough time?

632
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:59.560
If I speed up, we'll be able to make the plane.

633
00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.270
Okay.

634
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:07.590
♫<i> Hug those feelings</i> ♫

635
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.620
♫ <i>Remember it</i> ♫

636
00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:17.510

637

641
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:42.760
What do you think about this for when we explain Mureung's point of view?

642
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.490
What is it?

643
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:59.660
You're the first photographer that thinks of the article when taking photos.

644
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.580
It's perfect.

645
00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:10.260
- Should I just take a couple more before leaving? 
 - Yes.

646
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.450
She went to work, so what's going to happen?

647
00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:17.540
She's someone who went on a two-night, three-day business trip with a man where nothing happened.

648
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:20.020
What if something happens this time?

649
00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:22.420
You know those things.

650
00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.810
You're focusing so hard on work that you lose the car.

651
00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.300
You go to an inn but there's only one lodging left.

652
00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:31.320
But there's only one room in that lodging.

653
00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:36.600
I hate unexpected and unpleasant situations like this.

654
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:41.400
- Oh my goodness. Hey. You think that people nowadays don't come home because the last train is gone? 
 - You're right.

655
00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.310
It has to rain!

656
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.800
It looks like it's going to rain.

657
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:55.460
It's crazy.

658
00:51:57.170 --> 00:52:01.100
You have nowhere to go but it's raining and your clothes are soaked. There's a chill.

659
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:05.230
But the heater in the lodging is broken so the two have to hold one another

660
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:06.930
and share their body temperature.

661
00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:11.390
That's how something erotic happens. You don't know anything!

662
00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:15.640
I'm so uncomfortable.

663
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.660
The flight was canceled.

664
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.060
The buses are full and the trains are sold out.

665
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.620
What should we do?

666
00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.000
We have to extend the rental car and go back up. The planes aren't even flying.

667
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.850
We'll be able to leave, right?

668
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:55.700
As long as a landslide doesn't block the highway, we can leave!

669
00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:57.670
Let's go.

670
00:53:02.830 --> 00:53:05.580
<i>Breaking News: Due to a sudden downpour in the Seonam area,</i>

671
00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.160
<i>there was a landslide near Mureung </i>

672
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.200
<i>that has blocked the nearby highway.</i>

673
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.970
<i>The response team is putting in emergency restoration efforts.</i>

674
00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:16.160
<i>They estimate the restoration process will take about six hours.</i>

675
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.680
<i>We will provide updates as they come in.</i>

676
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.470
That isn't where they went, right?

677
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:21.650
No way.

678
00:53:27.870 --> 00:53:30.120
Does this make sense?

679
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.790
How do things just happen like this? Like it was planned or something.

680
00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.180
By chance, do you think I made this happen?

681
00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.720
No. You said we should come here.

682
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:45.160
From the moment you said that we absolutely had to rent a car to come all this way, I knew.

683
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:47.390
How could he use the main photo as bait?

684
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:49.860
This is quite original. I couldn't even think of something like this!

685
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.140
Say something that makes sense!

686
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:55.530
Are you saying that I made this landslide happen right now?

687
00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:58.740
No... well... you probably saw the weather in advance.

688
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.730
Doesn't it make more sense that this would be your doing?

689
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:06.350
No, not at all. I follow 2020 trends.

690
00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.120
They wouldn't even do these on dramas these days.

691
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.560
This kind of situation falls exactly in line with Mr. Han Yisang's 1988 trends.

692
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.380
What, 1988? Is this how you're going to corner me?

693
00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:18.550
Well, we'll find out soon anyway.

694
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:25.570
Look. I'm telling you. We'll go to a countryside grandma's lodging place.

695
00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.630
<i>[Private Lodging]</i>

696
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:30.580
Is anyone there?

697
00:54:31.610 --> 00:54:33.670
Is anyone here?

698
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:36.660
Is there nowhere else? Is this the only place?

699
00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.930
You saw that this was the only place.

700
00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:46.330
Exactly. You sure found the only lodging here well.

701
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.250
Is no one here?

702
00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:53.550
Did you come...

703
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:57.920
to look for a room?

704
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.770
Yes, yes. We are looking.

705
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:04.860
There's probably only one room like in the movies.

706
00:55:04.860 --> 00:55:08.360
We have three rooms.

707
00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.500
You can each have one.

708
00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.990
The rentals aren't shared...

709
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:20.390
We— We'll do that. We'll use one room each and—

710
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.680
and Jang Hari will use one room alone,

711
00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:30.150
and we'll use it well, not even touching shoulders.

712
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:34.210
Please do as you please.

713
00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:36.120
Yes, thank you.

714
00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.820
Thank you.

715
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:44.680
I guess we have to use that to make our food ourselves.

716
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.390
It seems that way.

717
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:51.750
But will you able to sleep here? I'll sleep in the car—

718
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.360
Then, I'll sleep in the car...

719
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.730
Put them on.

720
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.510
You're considerate.

721
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:06.590
We'll change.

722
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:10.500
<i>The person you are trying to call</i>

723
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.870
She still hasn't come. Her phone is also off.

724
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.660
She said she didn't have a lot of battery. She isn't coming tonight.

725
00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:21.330
She's sleeping outside tonight? She's just with Han Yisang right now, isn't she?

726
00:56:21.330 --> 00:56:24.780
Aunt, you're just letting it go that she's spending the night with some guy?

727
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:27.900
You should chase after her and drag her here.

728
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.090
It's a "thank you" if she's out spending the night with a man.

729
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.140
What kind of man is he? Is he okay? What about his age?

730
00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:36.960
Does he have a home? Does he work hard?

731
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:40.180
He doesn't have a home or a family.

732
00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:45.470
He's old, and his face is scary. It's dreary.

733
00:56:45.470 --> 00:56:48.060
He's a weird man. I object.

734
00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.320
If you hate it that much, then you go and live with her.

735
00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:58.280
I'm just worried like a big brother, Aunt. Why are you like this to me?

736
00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.950
What big brother is he talking about? He's one month younger.

737
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:05.390
Just try and come home. I won't stand still!

738
00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.350
Not getting service.

739
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.230
Heave-ho!

740
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.740
You're very rural-like.

741
00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.520
What are you saying? Everyone thinks I'm an overseas Korean.

742
00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.230
Kevin. Daniel.

743
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:20.030
Yeah.

744
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.050
No, why are you burning firewood?

745
00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:34.740
There's a gas stove inside.

746
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:40.920
It's an induction so I guess you didn't find it.

747
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.460
There's an iron cauldron, so...

748
00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.170
That's the interior.

749
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.180
Did you make food?

750
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:58.350
For your food, it's like a hotel's room service.

751
00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:02.080
You guys sure are old-fashioned.

752
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.380
It's hot and nice!

753
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:16.360
The coffee has come.

754
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:19.010
Thank you.

755
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:21.320
It's my first time seeing coffee like this.

756
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.370
Rice bowl coffee.

757
00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:31.490
How did you start taking pictures?

758
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:35.230
My father's hobby was taking pictures.

759
00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:39.150
I'd drop off film with my father at the photography store.

760
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:44.330
And I'd get so excited to pick them up. I just liked that.

761
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.640
That's why your photos are warm.

762
00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.300
The photos are like you.

763
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:07.510
Then... I was curious about how the photos would come out and there was an excitement about waiting.

764
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:12.990
Wondering what will happen tomorrow... There's nothing I could be more curious about.

765
01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.330
I'm only curious about today, the present.

766
01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:24.710
How we're going to spend this night?

767
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.610
I-It's good, right?

768
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.250
Are you done washing?

769
01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:09.330
Yes.

770
01:01:09.330 --> 01:01:12.180
I'm going to go wash.

771
01:01:14.340 --> 01:01:17.320
Warm water comes out, right?

772
01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.210
It comes out well!

773
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.330
Goodnight. 
 <i>(In the very formal way)</i>

774
01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.230

786
01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:48.470
♫<i> Like the feeling of falling in love</i> ♫

787
01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:53.670
♫<i> You take me up to the stars</i> ♫

788
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:57.840
♫<i> Oh, catching teardrops in my hand</i> ♫

789
01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.060
♫<i> When you are having a hard time, I'll hug you </i>♫

790
01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:21.170
<i> [What are you doing now, Han Yisang?] </i>
 ♫<i> Just like now with you day by day</i> ♫

791
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:25.340
♫<i> Don't don't don't don't forget my heart</i> ♫

792
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:31.760
♫<i> When falling down again. Down again, I'm here</i> ♫

793
01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:36.420
♫<i> Making sure that you're okay</i> ♫

794
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:42.490
♫<i> When feeling down again. Down again, I'm here</i> ♫

795
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:46.940
♫<i> I will be your sunlight</i> ♫

796
01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.140
Han Yisang!

797
01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.700
What are you doing there?

798
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.000
What is it?

799
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.160
Wait. Shhh.

800
01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:15.080
Why are you whispering?

801
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:43.790
This is so cool.

802
01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:11.290
I'm out of my mind.

803
01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.920
It sure is windy.

804
01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:26.780
Let's block the wind, okay?

805
01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:29.160
Your body is big—

806
01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:47.620
♫<i> Don't say anything</i> ♫

807
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:56.470
♫<i> You, like fate, are by my side like usual</i> ♫

808
01:06:56.470 --> 01:07:01.830
♫<i> It's only you for me</i> ♫

809
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:09.230
♫<i> The one person who approaches me</i> ♫

810
01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:18.080
♫<i> As you approach, like a dream where we get further apart, the pain comes</i> ♫

811
01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:23.460
♫<i> What should I do?</i> ♫

812
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:30.410
♫<i> Can you see? My feelings for you?</i> ♫

813
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:37.380
♫<i> Can you hear? My voice that calls for you? </i> ♫

814
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:41.930
♫<i> You, who's shining like a star</i> ♫

815
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:45.440
♫<i> I'm drawing you in that sky</i> ♫

816
01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:51.260
♫<i> I'll protect you</i> ♫

818
01:08:03.490 --> 01:08:10.150
♫<i> All the warm memories that I have missed so much</i> ♫

819
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:14.550
♫<i> is overwhelmingly falling from my heart</i> ♫

820
01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.370
<i>[Oh My Baby]</i>

821
01:08:17.370 --> 01:08:21.360
<i> You were together for two days and one night, and you're telling me you're in a meeting?</i>

822
01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.060
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

823
01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.060
<i>Why are you apologizing? I'm kind of offended.</i>

824
01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:28.890
<i>You need to meet the right man. You can't just look on the outside and fall for him.</i>

825
01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:32.760
<i>Don't protect me. I'm 39, not 19.</i>

826
01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.590
<i> I think we need to sort out our roles.</i>

827
01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.420
<i> I told you that I'm in the position where we live together.</i>

828
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.430
<i>You're so small! You fit right in my chest.</i>

829
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:43.070
<i>What are you going to do if I just take another step!</i>

830
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:45.570
<i>What do you think of me as a woman?</i>

831
01:08:46.530 --> 01:08:48.060
<i>Huh?</i>
