00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.860
I just put a spell on you.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.380
To stop you getting mad at me.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.660
A fairy spreading is flowers!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.820
I think we need to break up.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.940
(Episode 23: The right to be jealous)

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.220
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.500
what would your last words be

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.500
if you were about to die?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.300
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.700
We need to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.500
break up.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.340
What did you say?

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.740
We need to break up.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.940
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.900
I don't like you making this kind of joke.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.700
I wasn't joking.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.380
Can you tell me why?.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.140
Sorry.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.700
I don't want your apology.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.940
I want the reasons.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.660
I'm not fit for a relationship now.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.620
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.140
What's not being fit for a relationship?

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.220
Is it because of your mom?

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.940
I've told you. I don't mind it at all.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.180
Sorry.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.940
Pick it up.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.900
It may be Mrs. Zhao.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.060
Zhou Xiao,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.580
let's break up.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.500
What on earth is the matter?

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.500
Can't you just say it and let me help you?

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.500
You...

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.540
you're still using our phone case.

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.220
No.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.100
I don't want it.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.420
Stop crying.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.500
What if I say I'm not breaking up with you?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:23.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.380
What if I say I'm not breaking up with you?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.660
Calm down.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.220
I was joking with you.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.980
Why would I disgrace myself so much?

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:49.060
I'm not that kind of person.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.380
I won't cry.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.620
But now that you've said sorry,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.420
it's okay for me to do this, isn't it?

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.500
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.780
if you change your mind now,

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.940
I'll consider everything as a joke.

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.700
Cai Yasi, how come I've never seen

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.820
the algorithm you wrote just now?

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.820
I came up with it myself.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.140
You came up with it yourself?

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.580
Don't keep it from us.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.020
Write it out later.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.700
Right.

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:40.700
Hey.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.940
Where's he going?

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:44.900
Leave him.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.140
Let's go.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:00.380
Thanks.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.660
Zhou Xiao.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.060
Hey, it's you.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:09.820
Are you okay?

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.820
Yes.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.620
You don't seem to be okay at all.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.140
So

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.140
can I cry now?

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.780
But it's shameful to cry out here.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:34.780
Come on.

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.060
So Zhao Fanzhou really broke up with you?

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.500
Why?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.820
You've asked me a hundred times.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.500
I said I didn't know.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.660
So

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.060
did you agree?

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.140
Are you stupid?

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.260
What could I do if I didn't agree?

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.780
Kneel down and beg him?

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.140
I'll break your legs if you dare to do that.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.060
No, I'll break his legs.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.980
Sit down. Sit down.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.380
Won't this crying make you feel tired?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.620
Can you shut up?

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.620
You shouldn't have dated someone
right after you went to college.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.340
Isn't studying hard better?

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.180
You shouldn't have dated him.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:44.060
Don't do that.

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.060
I'm afraid I'll lose control of myself.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.860
Why did he break up with me?

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.460
Why did he break up with me?

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.620
I don't want it.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.860

Read any one

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.620
of the western classics.

Write a summary of it and your thoughts.

reading is very

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.820
So for this semester,

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.140
I listed works

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.340
of western literature that you must read.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.780

at the end of this semester,

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.740
every one of you will have

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.620
read at least half of them.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.820
That's all for today's class.

See you.

He won't ask for forgiveness by sending

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:56.700
a message if he regrets something.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.860
Still, you can have a look at it.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.420
(Notice: Dear president, the election of
the new school year is about to begin,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.740
please come to the Student Union
and get an election form.)

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.100
I said it wasn't him.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.260
The Student Union informed clubs

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.820
of an election of the new school year

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.100
and asked the presidents
to go and get a form.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:23.620
Are you going there?

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.060
No.

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.340
I

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.740
downloaded an electronic one.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.860
I'll just print it.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.780
I think you should go.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.980
Perhaps you'll see Zhao Fanzhou

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.580
and then you can talk with him.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.260
Nothing needs to be talked about.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.140
We just broke up.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.860
I don't have anything to ask him.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.780
Xiao,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.540
you've been too calm

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.140
after this break-up.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.500
Perhaps it's because I have

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.660
had a dry run before.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.260

Hello, what can I do for you?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.260
Hello, I'm from the Detective Club.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:37.620
I came for an election form.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:38.500

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.220
Okay.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:42.940
Do you know Zhao Fanzhou
applied for withdrawal

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:43.820
from the Student Union?

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.540
Yes.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.220
He's really a strange man.

There's going to be an election already

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.260
and he wants to withdraw now.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.340
Chen Yu has gone back to his own school.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.660
Now I have to do

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.220
all of the work.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.820
It's wearing me out.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:03.300
Hey.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.260
Thanks.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.380
Ms. Huang.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:44.820
Zhou Xiao.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.900
You came at a good moment.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.700
Help me post a want ad of the library

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.100
on the campus forum.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.940
I tried to release it

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:53.420
but it kept saying that I failed.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:54.860
A want ad?

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.340
Are we short-handed at the moment?

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.300
Yes. The juniors need to do internships

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:00.900
instead of part-time jobs.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.300
Hasn't your Zhao Fanzhou quit his, too?

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.620
Yes, he has.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.020
I'll send it to your email.

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:08.580
Help me upload it.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.220
Okay.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.260
Zhou Xiao, I've sent it to your email.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:13.980
Have a look at it.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:14.980
Okay.

(Zhao Fanzhou: Withdrawal Application)

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.900
Dear president,

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.060
I'm Zhao Fanzhou from the Department
of Forensic Medicine.

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.900
It was a great honor
to join the Detective Club.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.860
For some personal reasons,

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:53.060
I can't take part in activities
of the club anymore.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.740
Now I'm applying for withdrawal from it.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.020
I hope the Detective Club
will be better and better.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.460
Please approve of my application.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:03.300
Applicant: Zhao Fanzhou.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.900
Zhou Xiao, did you receive the email?

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.300

Zhou,

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.940
have some fruit.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.860
Lu insisted on buying it for me.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.660
She said

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.180
I had to eat fruit in all kinds

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.580
of colors every day

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.060
and only then would my skin

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:19.060
be rosy

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:19.900
and different.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:22.820
No, thanks.

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.860
I've washed it. Eat some.

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:26.820
This is a gift

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.820
my girlfriend prepared for me.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.380
I'm so generous
and want to share it with you.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.740
Unlike me,

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.580
you never shared what Zhou Xiao gave you.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.820
Sorry, Zhou.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.740
I...

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.380
I forgot that you had broken up.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.180
Don't get cross.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.020
Why don't you eat some fruit and cool down?

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:56.820
Are you leaving me again?

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.620
What I mean is

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.100
that I, well,

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:05.060
I won a national championship.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.300
I want to share

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.060
my joy with you.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.060
Share it with your Lu.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.660
Of course I've shared it with her.

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.700
Aren't we good friends?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.420
I also need to share it with you.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.860
You know what?

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:19.660
I'll get my prize today.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.420
Go after we have a celebration dinner.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.380
I'm not free for that.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:25.940
Hey.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:28.420
How could you reply like that?

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:29.820
Aren't you being a spoilsport?

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.660
Zhou,

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:42.940
do you know how big my prize is?

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:45.940
A hundred and fifty thousand.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.420
You are here.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.140
Just say what's up.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.260
Just now I hit you

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.260
as Zhou Xiao's good friend.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.300
You could break up with her

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:47.820
but you didn't even have a proper reason.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:49.140
Isn't that too awful?

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:56.740
Now

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.100
I'll speak to you as someone
who likes Zhou Xiao.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.180
Thanks.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.980
After all, you gave me a chance

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:05.420
to be with Zhou Xiao.

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.340
Don't let her see you again.

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:10.780
Okay.

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.940
Don't you have other things to say?

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.220
Is she so dispensable to you?

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:21.860
Take good care of her.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.380
I will take good care of her

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:32.300
and even better than you.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.460
We've known each other for such a long time.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.380
I know Zhou Xiao the best.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.820
Good.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.820
She often forgets to eat
when she's busy writing.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.660
Even if you put

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.540
the food in front of her,

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.980
she still won't eat it.

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.620
If you feed her,

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.860
she'll eat it without having a look at it.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.780
She won't watch out
for cars when crossing the road.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:09.300
Watch out!

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.340
You have to get mad at her.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:14.860
Only then will she take it seriously.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.420
Surprised? Shocked? Moved?

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.180
Don't you watch out for cars
while crossing the street?

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:21.860
It's 1:00 a.m., but you're outside alone.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.900
What if anything happened to you?

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.900
I didn't even know you came here.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.060
Although she's always careless,

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:33.820
she's also good at acting cute.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.460
What are you doing?

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.300
I just put a spell on you.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.580
To stop you getting mad at me.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.620
You really can't be mad at her.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.420
But sometimes

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:53.940
she can be very mischievous.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.860
You're like a little cat now.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.940
If you also play a trick on her,

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.620
she'll be unhappy.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:07.900

No.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.780

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:18.300
and wants to try everything,

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:19.860
actually she's easily frightened.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.660
You have to keep her company.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.380
Calm down. It's just a plate.

What?

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.220
I shouldn't bring up the break-up thing.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.420
Because it's a jinx.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.420
It's because we won't break up.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.460
♪... look what you bring out in me.♪

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.440
Yes, we won't break up.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:16.820
♪If I have to write a song for my youth,♪

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:25.700
♪it should be a song about you and me.♪

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:35.260
♪A sweet melody of sweet love story,♪

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:43.420
♪look what you bring out in me.♪

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.980
I thought this kind of sadness

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.820
would tear my heart apart.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.100
But strangely,

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.060
I only felt a dull ache occasionally

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:56.220
and it seems I can endure

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.060
this degree of pain.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:41.420
Mom,

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:42.660
take your pills.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.660
I'm not taking them,

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.900
unless you ask Zhou Xiao to come here.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.980
Did you quarrel with Zhou Xiao?

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.980
No.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.580
Did you really get wounds

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.140
on your face from falling?

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.340
Yes.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.140
Why hasn't she come to see me

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.260
for so many days, then?

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:09.140
Perhaps she has too many classes

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.660
and doesn't have time to see you.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.180
She would call me before.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.620
If she didn't have time to come here,

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.220
she would send me Wechat messages.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.220
She'll call you when she's free.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:26.380
Fanzhou,

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.740
did Zhou Xiao consider it

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.060
and think she couldn't accept my illness?

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.740
Does she wanna break up with you?

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.180
No.

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:38.780
She's not someone like that.

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.820
Don't imagine things.

00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:42.940
Swear.

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.900
You swear. Swear.

00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.140
Take your pills first.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.260
Zhou Xiao wouldn't talk to me fiercely

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.220
and so seriously.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.420
Ms. Liu,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.380
the new comers will be here soon.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:15.340
I asked them to get their work cards here.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.700
Okay. No problem.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.020
By the way,

00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:19.380
when will those who resigned come

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:20.460
and hand over their duties?

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:21.700
Also today.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.580
Okay.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.420
Oh, Zhou Xiao,

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.500
help Zhao Fanzhou

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.740
hand over his responsibility later.

00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:30.620
Okay.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.940
Have lunch with Zhou Xiao

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.340
and ask her

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.940
when she'll come to see me,

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:39.700
okay?

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.300
Put it at the wrong place again.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.660
He's coming here today.

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.340
Zhao Fanzhou?

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.180
How long are you gonna squad here?

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.420
Zhou Xiao.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.780
What are you doing here?

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.620
I came to be your colleague.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.060
What do you think? Are you happy?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.260
Yes.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:12.660
Why would you work part-time here?

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.340
Well, there are air conditioners
and I can make money.

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.300
Why shouldn't I do that?

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:22.540
Sure enough,
rich people like to make money more.

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:32.020
Alright, stop behaving like this.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.300
I just can't be nice to you, right?

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:37.100
Come on.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.580
I'll show you around your workplace.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:41.660
Yes, boss.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.300
Sycophant.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.460
Generally we'll have meetings

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.940
or deal with books here.

00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.980
The librarians often...

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:52.820
This way!

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.420
Stupid man.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:57.620
The librarians often work there.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.300
There.

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.060
Sometimes we'll work there, too.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.420
Well,

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.980
we're colleagues now.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:04.940
I'll help you.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.580
Help yourself first.

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.740
Have a look at it.

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.900
I don't know why.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.380
This computer
just can't get on the campus network.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.020
I'll check it first, Ms. Huang.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.940
You're the most boring person I've seen.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.140
Let go.

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:24.020
Ms. Huang.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.260
Ms. Huang,

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.020
I'm a new part-timer here,

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.020
Cai Yasi
from the Department of Computer Science.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:40.740
Hello.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.780
You're from
the Department of Computer Science?

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.340
Can you help me fix my computer?

00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.540
It can't get on the campus network.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.380
Oh,

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.700
he's fixing it already.

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:56.340
Let the professional handle it.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:00.900
Come and have a look.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.940
Come on.

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.460
Is it hard to fix?

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.220
Just a moment.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.260
Very soon. It's a piece of cake.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.980
Done, Ms. Huang. Have a look.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.140
It's done already?

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:51.740
Thank you.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:55.900
Fanzhou,

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.260
tell Yasi about your duties.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.260
Pay more attention

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.860
to jobs in the Room of Precious Literature.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.700
Come on.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.500
Do you want to die here, Cai Yasi?

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.180
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.140
It's my bottle.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.860
I don't mind drinking your water.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.580
I do.

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:30.420
Let's go.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.700
I'll tell you in the literature room.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:38.940
Come on.

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:52.100
Love of young people

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.100
is so scary.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.220
Every month this room will accept a batch

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:01.220
of books that are out of print
and donated by alumni.

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.660
Generally we'll scan them and upload

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.380
the electronic versions
to the online library.

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:09.540
We'll also provide their copies

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.500
for students to borrow.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.540
(Out of paper. Please load the stack
of paper into the paper tray.)

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.620
The originals will be stored

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:32.700
in this room.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.820
Students can only read them here

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.540
and need to register before that.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:39.140
(Out of paper. Please load the stack
of paper into the paper tray.)

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.180
It ran out of papers. I'll fetch some.

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:43.740
I'll go, too. I gotta know where they are.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.060
What are you doing?

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.980
You think you're Popeye the Sailor?

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.340
Can you tie your lips together?

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.220
I'll tie them in a bow.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.260
Tie a fast knot.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:11.260
Boss, I've finished cleaning.

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.500
Can you wipe it carefully?

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.980
Can't you see the dust?

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.540
Nope.

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.180
Where?

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.180
Here.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:19.580
Where?

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.340
Here.

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:23.980
Cai Yasi,

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.180
listen,

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.420
the Room of Precious Literature needs

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:28.460
to be dusted every week.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.460
If you do this one more time,

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.420
I won't work with you again.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.460
Okay. I'll clean it carefully.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:39.020
Give it to me.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.140
I'll wipe this place.

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.620
You wipe that.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:43.700
Okay.

00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.540
Keep wiping your bookshelves,

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.220
stupid woman.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.700
What's the matter?

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.700
Let me see.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.100
Are you okay?

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.060
Yes.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.420
Thanks.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:33.060
What happened?

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:35.500
Nothing. I just got

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:37.340
a thorn in my hand and I couldn't find it.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:39.900
Don't move.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.500
Where is it?

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:54.460
I can't find it either.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.860
Never mind. Leave it.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:41:59.860
I'm okay.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.020
I'll take you to the campus hospital.

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.180
I'm not going there.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.420
It's just a minor injury.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:09.140
I don't want someone to say

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.060
that I'm not taking good care of you.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:13.740
What are you talking about?

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.460
I'm taking her to the campus hospital.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:17.340
Mm.

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:33.780
Walk faster. It's time for lunch.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:34.900
What if the doctors knock off?

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.580
I said I was okay. I'm not going there.

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:39.100
The doctors will laugh at me.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.260
What if it's inflamed?

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.180
I can pull the thorn out, then.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.060
Hurry up.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.860
Who is it? Why don't you answer it?

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.460
Zhao Fanzhou's mom.

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.860
What does his mom call you for?

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:02.300
Don't answer it.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.500
Hello, Mrs. Zhao.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.420
Zhou Xiao,

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:09.700
why haven't you come to see me recently?

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.620
Mrs. Zhao,

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.500
hasn't Zhao Fanzhou told you?

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.060
Yes. He said you were busy.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:19.300
But I think

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.420
you have to eat however busy you are.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.260
Could you come

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.700
and have dinner

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.300
with me tonight?

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:28.180
Mrs. Zhao,

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.340
I'll go to see you another day.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:33.460
Another time?

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.220
Okay, I know you're busy.

00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:40.580
I ordered takeouts.

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.940
Oh,

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.180
I've got to cancel them.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.580
Wait a moment, Zhou Xiao.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:46.820
I... I'll call you

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.620
after I cancel my takeouts,

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.380
okay?

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.260
Mrs. Zhao, wait.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.420
I'll go to see you now.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.740
Don't you have to write novels?

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.780
No. I've just finished it.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:02.060
Okay, I'll wait for you.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:02.700
Okay.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.460
You've broken up with Zhao Fanzhou.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:09.780
What do you go to see his mom for?

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.860
Mrs. Zhao is very unstable now.

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.260
I don't want to upset her.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:15.180
Aren't you too kind-hearted?

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.100
If you want to do a good deed,

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:17.420
donate lunch on the Internet.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.300
She asked you to go there

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:20.140
as an elder.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:21.900
She was taking the high road.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.820
Can you not talk nonsense

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:24.260
when you know nothing?

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:25.860
What shall I know?

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:28.540
You just don't wanna break up with him.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.940
You still like him.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:31.780
Cut the bullshit.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:33.740
Mrs. Zhao is in the Department of Psychiatry.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:41.140
What on earth are you following me for?

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.460
You said Zhao Fanzhou's mom

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:43.020
was unstable.

00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:44.220
What if she hits you?

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:45.940
She won't do that.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:48.580
You stay outside

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:50.620
and I'll go in.
I'll call you if anything happens

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.380
and you'll come to my rescue.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:51.980
Is that okay?

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:57.900
Alright.

00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.860
If anything happens,

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:00.940
call me.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.180
Got it. Give it to me.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:04.300
Hold it.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:10.540
You said you would treat me.

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:11.620
If you don't come out quickly,

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:12.700
I'll eat till you're broke.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.580
Come in.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.540
Mrs. Zhao, I'm here.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:41.860
You're here.

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.340
Yes.

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.180
You brought me fruits again.

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:44.940
Give it to me.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:48.020
They can only be eaten after meals.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:49.500
Put your bag here.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.740
Come and look.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.300
These are all dishes you like.

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:57.900
Thank you, Mrs. Zhao. I like them.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:45:58.900
Quickly. Have a seat.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.300
Okay.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:45:59.700
Mm.

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:03.380
Sit.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.620
They must be delicious.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:05.620
Here are your chopsticks.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:06.340
Thanks.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:06.620
Mm.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:09.060
The doctor said

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.220
I've almost recovered.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.860
If I don't get worse,

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:12.900
I'll be able to leave hospital next week.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.380
Really?

00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:14.100
Yes.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.180
Great.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.860
After I leave hospital,

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.180
can you go to my home?

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:20.580
Okay.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.180
I'll make some nice things for you.

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.540
Mm.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.860
Let me see.

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.460
I'll make Fried Chicken Wings
which Fanzhou likes.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.220
Actually he can make it, too.

00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:33.540
He makes it better than me.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.380
He has really learned everything

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:38.140
to look after me over the years.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:38.860
Mm.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.060
He made it when he came to my house before.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:42.060
It was nice.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:45.140
He went to your house?

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.140
Mm. Yes.

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.340
I didn't know it at all.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:50.260
Perhaps he didn't tell you.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.020
He is like that sometimes.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.740
He doesn't tell me anything

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.660
as if he's the only adult in our family,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.500
just like an old man.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.260
Sometimes he's really annoying,

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:03.860
isn't he?

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.380
Yes, he is.

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:07.140
Oh,

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.540
I secretly asked you to come here.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:10.820
You mustn't tell him.

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:11.940
Otherwise, he'll say,

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.540
"You affected her studies."

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.260
Don't worry, Mrs. Zhao.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.740
I'm on your side.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.180
Okay. Let's be on one another's side.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:21.900
Eat.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:23.300
Have some more, Mrs. Zhao.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:23.780
Mm.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:24.580
Okay.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.180
Mrs. Zhao,

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.700
why do you put the food into one box?

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.740
There are many stray dogs
outside the hospital.

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.660
When we take a walk later,

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:35.500
we can feed them.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:36.780
Okay.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.700
Mom, I'm coming in.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:02.500
(Next Episode) I'm here
to apply for suspending my schooling.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.100
My mom had a relapse.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.340
To be honest,

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:06.620
I've liked her for a long time.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.180
Is there someone you miss very much?

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:09.740
Yes.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:11.420
Will you miss her greatly

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.980
but restrain yourself from going to see her?

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.040
Yes.
