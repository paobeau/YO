<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.310
I request this of you.

4
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.110
Please reconsider, just once.

5
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.050
If the reason to open the school violence hearing

6
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.360
is because someone touched your son,

7
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.950
please take that anger out on me.

8
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.170
The sin of having raised my child wrong lies with me,

9
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
so your anger or insults, I will accept them all.

10
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.520
So then try it, whatever it is.

11
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.180
Whatever would quell my anger.

12
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980
I request this of you,

13
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.690
just this once, please show your mercy.

14
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.750
Please get up.

15
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.090
What are you doing right now?

16
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.140
Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!

17
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.850
Explain what this situation is.

18
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.280
- What is this situation?
 - Joon Seo's Mother—

19
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.170
Please take Mother and give us some time to talk.

20
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.900
Yes.

21
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.810
I think I told you to not make this into a problem again.

22
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.330
A child's life, and whatnot.

23
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.430
Acting all righteous, but it turns out it was about a woman, huh?

24
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.500
What is she to you, that you are calling her name and acting so affectionate?

25
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.360
College junior.

26
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.520
First love? You mean like in that darn "Love Letter" or something?

27
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.660
I didn't want to involve the adults' problems in the children's matter,

28
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.760
but you just don't listen, no matter how much I tell you.

29
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.340
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.370
If you don't cancel the school violence hearing, then Se Hwi?

31
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.800
That guy named Se Hwi, he won't ever work as a model again.

32
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.780
He has nothing to do with this.

33
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.510
But he does have something to do with you.

34
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.010
So you're going to ruin a promising boy's future over something this trivial?

35
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.760
Yes, that's exactly what I want to say to you.

36
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.170
Do you know how much money they have donated?

37
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.460
If Joon Seo transfers to another school,
 <i>Episode 3</i>

38
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.250
we will have to immediately halt the construction of our school's gymnasium, that's how much they gave us.

39
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.190
And we would have to fire four to five teachers, too.

40
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.710
Why did he mess with Joon Seo, of all kids—

41
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.830
But I am thinking that my Yeong Min may have felt a bit lonely.

43
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.250
Of course, our school is out in the countryside,

44
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.280
so everyone feels lonely and everyone gets homesick.

45
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.220
But do all kids resort to violence because they are lonely?

46
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.330
What about Madame?

47
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.010
We have come to an understanding that the school violence hearing will not be held.

48
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.510
And Madame agrees with that—

49
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.710
If this happens again, we will transfer to another school.

50
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.030
Let me give you a ride back.

51
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.220
It's alright.

52
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.140
You must have had a difficult time traveling since early this morning because of us.

53
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.040
I know, right? It does hurt a bit.

54
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.100
My wrist hurts, and my knees hurt, too.

55
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.380
So get in. When your joints hurt, it is better to ride in a car.

56
00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.980
No, it's not my joints...

57
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.720
Hey, I'm not that old.

58
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.570
I know.

59
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.950
Huh, really.

60
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.960
Please let me get off here.

61
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.850
I can just go from here.

62
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.150
I'll let you off at Seoul Station.

63
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.350
No, I want to get off at this station.

64
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.370
There isn't any place here to buy shoes.

65
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:22.640
I can just go like this.

66
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.430
If I hadn't seen that, it's one thing. But I can't let you go in this state.

67
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.390
It's not as if you're an impoverished child.

68
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.320
Why would a grown adult walk around with such worn-out shoes?

69
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:37.370
But are things alright?

70
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.780
About what?

71
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.900
Joon Seo's mother.

72
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.970
Are you alright?

73
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.550
You bowed your head twice, and today, you even got down on your knees.

74
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.740
Something like that, I can do it 100, even 10,000 times

75
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.650
if only I could prevent my child from crying.

76
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.570
To me, that is love,

77
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.920
to make sure he doesn't cry.

78
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.710
So I can understand Joon Seo's mother.

79
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.110
Her method of protecting her loved one is simply different.

80
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.880
But, I'm saying this just so you won't misunderstand,

81
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.240
I'm not stopping this school violence hearing because it's you.

82
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:25.300
He keeps saying it isn't the case, but I think Joon Seo has been giving Yeong Min a difficult time.

83
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.470
Even in elementary school, he was always trying to be a group leader and tormented other children, and it became a problem.

84
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.990
His mother was indifferent to it,

85
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.760
and his maternal grandfather always took his side, so he was afraid of nothing.

86
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.190
This is a shameful and embarrassing thing to say, but I will try to speak to Joon Seo myself,

87
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:46.760
and you should talk with Yeong Min, too.

88
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:00.560
<i>When My Love Blooms: The Moment Living Becomes a Flower</i>

89
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.140
We should go to the front of your home, how can you, with those shoes?

90
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.980
If I run, it will only take one minute from here.

91
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.190
I think I have some shoes in my car, hold on.

92
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.630
I am really alright.

93
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.460
<i>Give this one to me, please.</i>

94
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.070
These are for men, so they will be a bit big.

95
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.060
But I think they will be better than those shoes.

96
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.770
I'm really alright. And it will be a hassle for me to return them to you.

97
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:49.350
You don't have to return them. Just use them at home when you take out the trash.

98
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.820
It's not at all expensive, so don't feel burdened, okay?

99
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:54.620
But I feel burdened...

100
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.800
<i>December 1993</i>

101
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.060
Are you Jo Yong Pil (famous singer)? Who do you think you are, to show up last?

102
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.920
My dad said I can't go on overnight club trips, so I had to sneak out...

103
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.290
You're always falling down, how can you do protests?

104
00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.190
Keep up with me! Don't get distracted.

105
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.140
Follow my footprints.

106
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:02.680
Are you alright?

107
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.350
What now?

108
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.020
Wow, your face looks like it's going to explode.

109
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.410
Everyone thinks you can hold your liquor, Sunbae.

110
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.450
You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me.

111
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.970
Because I'm looking only at you.

112
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.840
You,

113
00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.670
are you "Misery" (a movie)?

114
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.560
How did you know?

115
00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.900
I thought you were "Love Letter" (a movie),

116
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:42.630
but you were "Misery."

117
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:45.790
That's what everyone thinks,

118
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:50.050
but I really lean more toward horror, thriller, and psychopath genres.

119
00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.030
Of course, that doesn't mean I don't like "Love Letter."

120
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.790
It's so good, and the last scene is so moving.

121

<i>Jae Hyeon ♡ Ji Soo</i>

144
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.880
So let's hear it, "Love Letter" by Han Jae Hyeon.

145
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:43.730
I like melo movies a lot, too.

146
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.070
So tell me.

147
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.510
I found out that she was the other child's parent when I went to the school because of Joon Seo.

148
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.940
And that although the child is ranked first in his class, his family is not prosperous,

149
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.010
so she took care of him with some difficulties.

150
00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.150
And so I thought that if her child had a problem, she would struggle even more.

151
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.170
Is that the end?

152
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:59.550
How about making a decent person out of Joon Seo first?

153
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.680
It seems he's doing what he did in elementary school.

154
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.570
So you're saying he did that because of Joon Seo?

155
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.090
There is a high possibility.

156
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.340
So, that's why

157
00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.750
I told you to pay more attention.

158
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.220
I'm not someone who can make someone into a decent person.

159
00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.640
I will pay more attention, and if possible, I will go to pick him up on Saturday.

160
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.560
You should have done this before.

161
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.730
But, Honey,

162
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.840
why won't you ask me about it?

163
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.820
About that model?

164
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.720
You don't care?

165
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.580
Of course, it's not something I should applaud,

166
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.640
but I think some of the blame lies with me, too.

167
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.860
I was in prison for four years, and I was busy before that, due to work.

168
00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:50.150
Is that all? Aren't you even angry?

169
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.070
You seem like you have something you want to say, so I will ask you.

170
00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.450
Why did you meet another man

171
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:04.080
while I was locked away in the dark, of all times?

172
00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.520
Because I was lonely.

173
00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:14.410
Do I have any friends or any siblings?

174
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.580
All I have is Dad and you.

175
00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.560
But both of you were gone from my side, so...

176
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.570
So, don't make me lonely.

177
00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:30.480
I can't stand being lonely.

178
00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:37.360
Things to be enjoyed alone, they're all so squalid.

179
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:44.180
Vice President always looks so good in suits,

180
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.330
I think a basic style like this would suit him well, too.

181
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.630
Jae Hyeon does look good in suits, it doesn't even need to be said.

182
00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.830
But he has too many of these basic styles.

183
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.210
So it should be made of a different material, or the design should be unique.

184
00:17:56.210 --> 00:18:00.670
Yes, I will speak to our team leader when she comes.

185
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:06.360
But did the gloves he bought last time fit you well?

186
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:08.080
What are you talking about?

187
00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.150
Vice President came last time, and—

188
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:12.040
Jin Yeong.

189
00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.850
What is she talking about?

190
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.280
He bought something here?

191
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.170
Jae Hyeon did?

192
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.330
Was it for a woman?

193
00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:25.860
Uh, about that...

194
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:31.700
Bring it to me, and let me see what my husband's tastes are.

195
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.400
<i>College junior.</i>

196
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.650
<i>Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!</i>

197
00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:55.690
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

198
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.550
What's wrong?

199
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.840
Number 1, you knew where Ji Soo was, but you hid it from me.

200
00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:13.340
Number 2, you liked Ji Soo. So which is it?

201
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.940
Oh, stop saying nonsense. So you met the real Yoon Ji Soo?

202
00:19:18.990 --> 00:19:21.120
She's living well, isn't she? Without many problems?

203
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:23.480
Her son attends the same school as Joon Seo.

204
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.930
Wow, so our Ji Soo married into a rich family, huh?

205
00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.450
I thought she might be divorced, and she would be really poor, and maybe her husband was beating her.

206
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:35.400
I was so anxious, expecting the story to go in that direction.

207
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.040
So, she's still pretty as ever, right?

208
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.240
So it was Number 2, you punk.

209
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:42.420
Number 3, actually.

210
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.940
What is Number 3?

211
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.200
I think Ji Soo liked me quite a lot.

212
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.140
Didn't she ask about me?

213
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.260
No.

214
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.230
Wait, hold on.

215
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.260
Take your time. If you rush, it won't come out (poop).

216

Yes, hello?

218
00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.790
Yoo Ri's not available today for lessons?

219
00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:06.030
Oh well, then.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.770
That's alright.

Yes, thank you.

Hello Madam?

223
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:24.320
I'm calling because you said last time that Ha Yeong's younger sibling wanted to take some lessons.

224
00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.320
Is that so?

225
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:31.100
Well, it can't be helped. Please give me a call next time.

226

Yes, thank you.

227

228
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.510
Wow.

229
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.920
Long time, no see.

230
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.050
How long has it been?

231
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:54.480
About four days, maybe?

232
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.690
Oh, really?

233
00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.090
Wait.

234
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.910
My car will be here soon. Just wait a little bit.

235
00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.900
I'm fine, thanks.

236
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.940
I know you're fine, but let me just lend you an umbrella.

237
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.430
It's really fine. I can just—

238
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:14.660
You could just run, but it's cold today.

239
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:19.060
Just wait a little bit. It won't be long.

240
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.630
Just so you know, I'm not here for weird reasons.

241

What about the shop?

267
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.840
- I closed early.
 - Why?

268
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.180
Because of the rain. I'm in the mood for some drinks that someone else serves me.

His son goes to the same school as Yeong Min.

272

The school is high class, then. Hyeong Seong (Corporation)'s grandson attends it.

273
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.390
You knew?

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.690
Who he was married to?

275
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:06.020
I read it in a magazine. In an interview.

276
00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:08.480
Oh, that?

277
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.900
I saw that too.

278
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:17.250
Did you meet him?

279
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.600
How is he? Still as cool as always?

280
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.570
Not even. Even he couldn't help aging.

281
00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:30.520
He seemed like he would be cool even as he got older.

282
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.380
Like those handsome middle-aged  Hollywood stars.

283
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.090
He does look a bit like George Clooney.

284
00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.620
That's taking it too far. What about them look alike?

285
00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:41.400
Their eyes! The way his eyes wrinkle when he smiles.

286
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.000
Is there anyone of that age whose eyes don't wrinkle when they smile?

287
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.480
They're not regular wrinkles. They have depth.

288
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.090
Of course, they're deep because  he's old.

289
00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.940
Nope.

290
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.470
Something is sexy and dignified about them.

291
00:26:56.470 --> 00:27:00.330
Yoon Ji Soo's love blindness really does last a long time.

<i> December 1993 </i>

293

Okay, I acknowledge my mistake.

294
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.080
Isn't he just so good looking?

295
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.210
You drive me crazy. What's so good looking about him?

296
00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:18.120
He's so skinny, he looks like a dried-up beansprout.

297
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.100
Look at the lines he draws with his body.

298
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.300
Whenever he gets a pass, it looks like ballet instead of foot volleyball.

299
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.180
No wonder he's so bad. It must be because he's trying to do ballet instead.

300
00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.170
- Okay, serve! 
 - My ball, I got it, I got it!

301
00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.470
What are you doing? Ballet?

302
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.000
Can't you receive the ball properly?

303
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.540
- You said, "My ball!" 
 - When did I, you moron? It didn't even come in my direction!

304
00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:47.480
Sunbae Jae Hyeon really looks like a college student now.

305
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:51.530
Sunbae Jae Hyeon, Sunbae Jae Hyeon. Are you a flounder? Can you only see him?

306
00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:54.170
I wish he would play sports all the time instead of protesting.

307
00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.080
Stop dreaming. A dog won't quit pooping. 
 (T/N: Korean saying meaning one won't stop a habit easily.)

308
00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.350
Where can you find a dog as good looking as him?

309
00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:03.060
This isn't just love blindness. You have a disease!

310
00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.450
You should head in.

311
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:15.730
Should I go with you to get Yeong Min? Taking the train is tiresome.

312
00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:17.740
Forget it.

313
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.740
My love blindness is a disease, too.

314
00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:29.770
An incurable disease.

318
00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.470
<i>I thought you went to take a dump. Did you bail because you didn't want to pay for the drinks?</i>

319
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.480
<i>Are you really broke these days?</i>

320
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.720
Asking about how much lawyers make,

321
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.530
why are you doing things you didn't use to? It's ruining your character.

322
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:56.590
By the way, Dong Jin,

323
00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:59.170
do you want piano lessons for your kids, by chance?

324
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.200
My kids? Should we?

325
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.120
Now that one is about to turn one year old, and the other one is three, so it's about time, huh?

326
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.990
Especially because they're both boys?

327
00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.440
Yea, exactly.

328
00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.530
What do you mean, exactly?

329
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.260
By the way, Dong Jin...

330
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.890
<i>What now?</i>

331
00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:19.340
When do you think it'll rain again?

332
00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.480
<i>What kind of dog sound (nonsense) is this now?</i>

333
00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.000
<i>Ask the National Meteorological Administration, prat! You good-for-nothing.</i>

334
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.690
<i>Class Ranking - 11th out of 31 
 School Ranking - 50th out of 150</i>

335
00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:43.160
<i>Son, has your grade report not come out yet?</i>

336
00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.020
Yeah, Joon Seo. Dad is here, so come down.

337
00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.870
Okay.

338
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.390
You are Yeong Min, right?

339
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.860
Do you perhaps remember me?

340
00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.800
I'm Joon Seo's dad.

341
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.770
Hello.

342
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.310
Do you not like me very much?

343
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.870
Are you scared I might be on Joon Seo's side?

344
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.450
Not every father is automatically on their son's side.

345
00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:31.870
I'm on the loser's side.

346
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.510
I really wanted to tell you this.

347
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.400
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:44.650
But I'm the one who did wrong.

349
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:49.070
Winning and losing, right or wrong, it isn't all there is.

350
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:53.290
Looking at it this way, you probably aren't the only one in the wrong.

351
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.300
How do you know?

352
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.350
I just do.

353
00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.780
When you get to my age, there are some things come in sight even if you aren't looking at them.

354
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:06.490
By the way, it looks like you are having some worries, Yeong Min.

355
00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:10.730
Is Joon Seo still tormenting you, perhaps?

356
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:17.860
I see.

357
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.560
It isn't the only reason.

358
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:28.000
My grades have dropped a lot.

359
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.850
Yeong Min.

360
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:49.450
Mom stayed up all night making this using Chefs Kim Su Mi and Baek Jong Won recipes. 
 <i>(T/N: cooking show celebrities)</i>

361
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.580
Try it.

362
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.930
I'm not hungry.

363
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:54.990
Come on, you should still do me the favor of eating it.

364
00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:01.990
Even though the school cafeteria gives you a lot of food, it isn't anything tasty.

365
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.390
Wait!

366
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.330
Aunt Hye Jeong bought it for you, saying you should grow very tall.

367
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.200
It's tasty, isn't it?

368
00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.230
Joon Seo's dad.

369
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:35.590
He seemed very different from Joon Seo.

370
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:37.280
Did he?

371
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.850
What did he seem like?

372
00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:44.190
He was nice and seemed warm-hearted.

373
00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.250
To me, he looked a bit cold, though.

374
00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.420
I am absolutely not envious of Han Joon Seo for being rich,

375
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.220
but I'm a bit envious of his dad.

376
00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:07.810
But instead, you have an amazing mom, don't you?

377
00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.170
But, Yeong Min,

378
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:18.010
I wish you would have worries fitting to your age.

379
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.650
What do you mean?

380
00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.350
"If I do it like this, what will happen?", "I can't do that, right?",

381
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.790
"Alright, let's endure it for a bit."

382
00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.870
Stop having these kinds of thoughts now.

383
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.490
Say it hurts when you're in pain,

384
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.670
say things like "Why is everyone bothering me, really!"

385
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.750
Be like that a little bit, is what I'm saying.

386
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.630
For you to throw a chair at Joon Seo,

387
00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.490
he must have thrown something at you as well.

388
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.400
But you are keeping that to yourself,

389
00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:01.690
and all the adults are talking about your chair only.

390
00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.320
Yeong Min.

391
00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:11.370
You aren't an adult.

392
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:14.420
Why would you endure and hold everything in by yourself?

393
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.330
That's cheating, and worse, it's even illegal.

394
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.340
But you're alone, Mom.

395
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.550
You have to make money by yourself,

396
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:28.920
and you also have to raise me alone.

397
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.560
Grandma isn't here, and as for Grandpa, it's pretty much like he's not here either.

398
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.740
You have to do everything by yourself.

399
00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:39.340
If something happens to me,

400
00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.140
you can't do anything about it and have to come alone.

401
00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.010
That's even more reason why you should tell me everything.

402
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.940
Because I only have you and you only have me.

403
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.660
That's what I'm saying. You only have me,

404
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.530
but if I get kicked out of school, Dad might take me away from you.

405
00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:05.020
Yeong Min.

406
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:07.850
No one can take you away.

407
00:35:07.850 --> 00:35:10.830
Actually, you don't really know,

408
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:16.940
but I, uhm, just like the Black Widow and Captain Marvel you like,

409
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.830
I'm as incredibly strong as those ladies.

410
00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:21.790
Pew! Oh my!

411
00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:23.940
Are you all right?

412
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.710
Does it hurt?

413
00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.470
I'm not crying because it hurts.

414
00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.850
I hear that you work at the company now, so why has nothing changed?

415
00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.140
It's been a while since I told you to clean up those (protesting) ajummas.

416
00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.120
Are you protesting against me now?

417
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.810
No.

418
00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.150
Why make Jae Hyeon do things like that? What about the other employees under him?

419
00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:56.810
Who is better at cleaning up people?

420
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.820
- What, you don't want to work?
 - No, I do.

421
00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:03.420
Then clean it all up in one week.

422
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.240
Will it do for the company to look so messy when we have foreign buyers coming and going all the time?

423
00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.080
I understand.

424
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:14.430
You leave alone the ajummas I told you to clean up,

425
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.120
but why are you meeting with the president of Seoul Bank? Do you need money?

426
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.610
I don't think he's having me followed, yet.

427
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.630
<i>From the Majority Leader to the madam of a brothel in Cheongdam,  </i>

428
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:27.460
<i>the old fart's network is said to be no joke. I guess it turned out to be true.</i>d

429
00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:30.420
Well, it's not surprising, considering this is how he made this company.

430
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.120
It seems the police CCTV will be greeting you.

431
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.380
So in order to avoid that CCTV,

432
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.990
we have to move without moving. We can do that, right?

433
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.060
<i>Yes, we must become invisible, I guess.</i>

434
00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:44.140
Oh, and send me the list of temporary employees who have been dismissed.

435
00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.670
There is someone I need to look into.

436
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.020
<i>Job Application Resume - Yoon Ji Soo</i>

437
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.940
What's with this woman?
 <i>Seonghun Girls High School: Graduated
 Yeonhui University, Piano Major: Dropped Out</i>

438
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.930
With this, it appears she approached him on purpose, no?

439
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.820
She began working at the supermarket while Vice President was incarcerated.

440
00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:58.190
- So it's vague.
 - Does Jae Hyeon know?

441
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:02.710
It wouldn't have been easy for him to find out unless she told him herself.

442
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:06.060
There are nearly 1,000 temporary employees who have been dismissed.

443
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.030
He must continue to not know about this.

444
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.430
If he finds out about the divorce, supermarket, and even the dismissal,

445
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.200
he will die of pity for her, knowing his personality.

446
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:20.880
It wounds my pride to see him have an affair with a woman like this.

447
00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.230
It seems like he really loves her or something.

448
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.750
Alright, raise your son well and be healthy.

449
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.920
I'm so sorry.

450
00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.890
You've worked hard, Ji Soo.

451
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:41.750
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.840
We know it all, you don't have to say it.

453
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.200
Just don't forget about us after you leave.

454
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.820
I won't forget, I will never forget.

455
00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:55.130
<i>Hyeong Seong Market's management board, wake up!</i>

456
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:57.020
<i>Wake up! Wake up!</i>

457
00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.090
Dismissal is murder! Withdraw the dismissals!

458
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.180
Withdraw! Withdraw!

459
00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:04.150
<i>Hyeong Seong Market's management board, wake up!</i>

460
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:07.400
<i>It says it will rain tomorrow, can we meet briefly?</i>

461
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.900
<i>I need that umbrella.</i>

462
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:12.200
<i>And I have some things I wanted to talk about with you.</i>

463
00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:20.680
How strange, it definitely said it would rain.

464
00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.230
I used it well.

465
00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.910
Is it alright even if we don't have a meal?

466
00:38:26.910 --> 00:38:28.830
I already ate.

467
00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:34.090
But, what you had to tell me.

468
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:39.410
- Is it about school?
 - No.

469
00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:41.280
Then, what...

470
00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:46.950
I don't know if you already know this, but I am the vice president of Hyeong Seong Mart.

471
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:51.610
And the fact that you worked as a temporary employee there and were dismissed,

472
00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.180
I found out, recently.

473
00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:58.110
You don't have to tell me what your situation was, however,

474
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.530
I hope you don't participate in the protests in front of the company headquarters.

475
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.030
Why must I do that?

476
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:08.710
I was dismissed unfairly, too.

477
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.230
The corporation will take legal action.

478
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.660
And based on what I looked into, we did not violate any laws.

479
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:20.040
I just hope that you are not harmed.

480
00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.790
I can find another job for you, too.

481
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:24.500
So you're telling me that I should be the only one to escape?

482
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.000
No.

483
00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.550
I think raising Yeong Min will be more important than anything, for you.

484
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.240
So you found out everything.

485
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.430
Did you look into my background or something?

486
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.890
Sunbae, you seem like a different person.

487
00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.270
Different from the person I knew.

488
00:39:56.270 --> 00:40:00.900
Yes, I am a completely different person.

489
00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.840
I am unspeakably selfish and materialistic.

490
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.560
And those temporary employees protesting right now,

491
00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.780
using tactics like illegal demonstration, property trespass, disruption of business,

492
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.230
I will mow them all down with that.

493
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.720
So, I think it will be good for you to stay out of it.

494
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.250
No.

495
00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:33.160
Is it loyalty to your colleagues?

496
00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.330
Or what? Is it your sense of justice?

497
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.320
It won't even earn you money.

498
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.000
So why?

499
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:47.860
Because I learned from you.

500
00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.740
That the losing side... is our side.

501
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.950
<i> January, 1994. </i>

502
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.200
- Ji Soo. 
 - What's the matter?

503
00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.050
Jae Hyeon and the others are out at the slum we were helping in Hyeonjeo-dong.

504
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.400
- They just called about something urgent.
 - A slum?

505
00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.240
Yes, it's similar to volunteering in rural areas, but in slums instead.

506
00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.680
You guys do that kind of work too?

507
00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:18.370
We may look shabby, but we're very active. I'll be off now, I don't have much time.

508
00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:19.950
Oh yeah, sure.

509
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:32.350
Hey! Give me my ttakji back! 
 <i>(T/N: ttakji is a toy, a folded paper tile)</i>

510
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.120
Give it back, give me my ttakji back!

511
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:17.490
Get out of the way!

512
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.570
Just knock it all down!

513
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.780
<i>Yah!</i>

514
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.590
<i>These rascals! Break it all down!</i>

515
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.510
<i>This...</i>

516
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.540
Did Yeong Woo not tell you?

517
00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.320
What?

518
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:14.550
He didn't tell you what we were here for?

519
00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.530
Your attire...

520
00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.990
Sorry, I didn't know.

521
00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.640
You must've ruined your nice clothes.

522
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.140
Good work.

523
00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.780
Why do you protest...

524
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:40.040
Why do you participate in demonstrations?

525
00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.810
You don't have time to study or even to have fun like other people.

526
00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:46.020
You're constantly chased and getting hurt.

527
00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.890
How can you live like that every day?

528
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.160
I want to call the losing side, my side.

529
00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.640
Everyone always wants to call the winners side their side.

530
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.100
So the losing side is always lonely and sad.

531
00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:11.470
Those who always lose no matter how many times they fight... I want to take their side.

532
00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:27.710
Taking the side of the ones who always lose no matter how many times they fight.

533
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.380
That's what I learned.

534
00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.170
Do you have the leisure to take someone's side?

535
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.430
You could end up losing too.

536
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:42.710
I don't care.

537
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:45.420
All this time, I haven't had much experience winning, anyway.

538
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:52.800
I may have never won, but I've also never been ashamed.

539
00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.220
I don't want to change that. Especially if that's because of you.

540
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:35.460
It was around here.

541
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:37.810
What do you mean?

542
00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:43.400
Hyeonjeo-dong.  Where I last had my conscience.

543
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:51.170
The fine dust levels are high today, Vice President.

544
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.930
If it's about being noxious, I'll easily win against some measly fine dust.

545
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:59.360
Come on, how can you say such thing?

546
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:00.990
You're right.

547
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:05.380
I guess the dust would be offended.

548
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.390
At least they don't interfere with the lives of others.

549
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:11.930
Did something happen today?

550
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:21.640
I want to be on your side.

551
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:27.460
Since you're on the losing people's side, you must be lonely too.

552
00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:30.000
So I'll be on your side.

553
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:36.220
It'll be difficult being on my side. You won't be able to do it.

554
00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:42.790
Being in Hyeonjeo-dong today, my heart felt weird and it ached.

555
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.280
But after hearing your story on top of that,

556
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:49.350
something in here keeps resonating,

557
00:47:53.370 --> 00:47:56.340
and I feel something hot rising inside me.

558
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.380
That's why I told you not to come.

559
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.490
It doesn't suit you.

560
00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.900
There are many people on my side already, so you just go back where you used to be.

561
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.230
I have to go to a meeting. Take the bus home.

562
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:30.680
♫ <i>Spring is blossoming in our hearts </i> ♫

563
00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.690
♫ <i>My fluttering heart waits for you</i> ♫

564
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:37.050
<i>It's me, Ji Soo.</i>

565
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.760
<i>I'm in front of your house.</i>

566
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:42.420
<i>I couldn't just leave today. </i>

567
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:47.610
<i> There is something that feels like it'll kill me if I don't tell you, and something I'd like to hear as well.</i>

568
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.370
<i>I'll wait. I'm not leaving until you come. </i>

♫ <i>The ticklish whispers of summer emotions </i> ♫

♫ <i>I had thought such beauty would never exist again</i> ♫

578
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.210
How can someone who plays the piano not even wear gloves?

579
00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:55.960
They're really like ice.

580
00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.630
Whether it's for organization or assembly, please stop hanging around.

581
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:14.340
It's not even a time where all citizens need to fight with their lives on the line.

582
00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.610
You aren't desperate and it isn't your belief either.

583
00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:25.620
To me, you are my belief and my world.

584
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:30.960
So I'll do all the things you do out of your belief.

585
00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.890
I'll be on the same side as you,

586
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:37.460
and I'm going to live in the world that you're living in.

587
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.800
I won't change my mind, so don't try to convince me otherwise.

588
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:56.320
Come to department room 310.

589
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.070
It's a circle that I made.

590
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.440
Is that about philosophy, too?

591
00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.760
No, it's about movies.

592
00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.610
Also...

593
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.320
We are dating as of today.

594
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:48.670
Sunbae used to be my side, my belief...

595
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.750
and my world.

596
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:08.220
Your belief is no longer of this world.

597
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:20.950
<i>Hyeong Seong</i>

598
00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:25.160
Since we offered to negotiate, we expect most of the leading demonstrators will come.

599
00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:28.090
A lot of people will also be gathering to support it.

600
00:53:28.090 --> 00:53:31.420
But we don't have much to bring to the negotiating table.

601
00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.150
Other than reinstating them, there isn't much else to discuss, and we cannot accept those terms.

602
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:41.070
It's a formal procedure and a show, for the purpose of building history.

603
00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.410
The negotiation will end within thirty minutes of starting.

604
00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:49.510
Then the police will be deployed immediately at that moment.

605
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.600
Please do that.

606
00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:58.230
I didn't learn anything and I didn't even graduate from university.

607
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:59.890
I don't know if we'll be able to do well.

608
00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:02.930
Don't worry. You know it best, after all.

609
00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.730
What it is that people want.

610
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:07.490
Should I take some cheongsimhwan? 
 <i>(T/N:  medicine for the nerves)</i>

611
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.450
Now that they suddenly want to talk,

612
00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:12.960
I feel more nervous.

613
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.760
I heard that the new vice president is even more vicious.

614
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:24.780
Even so, they say that he isn't a bad person. They say he's smart and logical.

615
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:29.700
It's worrisome because he's smart. We don't know what kind of tricks he'll play.

616
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:34.210
On top of that, since he's the chairman's son-in-law, he's definitely going to be on the company's side.

617
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.590
Even so, this is a great improvement.

618
00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:40.540
Before, they wouldn't even meet with us.

619
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:42.890
It'll turn out well. The world has changed a lot too.

620
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:44.970
It should be like that, right?

621
00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:47.760
Okay, then let's go and get just one drink somewhere.

622
00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:50.360
I think that's the only way I'll be able to fall asleep.

623
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.620
You're going to negotiate with them?

624
00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.280
Who said you could? You're just bypassing me, the CEO?

625
00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:03.620
Didn't you tell me to do whatever I want?

626
00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:06.390
Was being in there for four years the problem?

627
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:07.850
Why are you doing things you normally don't do?

628
00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:12.160
The process is just for formality;  the result won't change.

629
00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.150
Report every detail of the result of the negotiation to me.

630
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:20.340
Okay, I'm going to go out for some air.

631
00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.310
- Ji Soo. 
- Yes?

632
00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:38.740
I don't think that we're going to win.

633
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.050
Even so, I'm not going to lose easily.

634
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:50.370
Whether you win or lose, I'll be on your side until the end.

Seo Gyeong, what is it at this late hour?

641
00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:20.780
Please cancel the riot police for today.

642
00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.290
Pardon? But we already finished all the discussions with the police captain.

643
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:27.630
We'll decide again after the negotiation.

644
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.090
But why all of a sudden?

645
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.550
Please proceed that way.

646
00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.430
I understand.
