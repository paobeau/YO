(Previously on Episode 21)
I suggest you take her to Beijing.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.900
The day after tomorrow,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.100
I'm afraid I can't go to Beijing with you.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.980
I'll go to Beijing by high-speed rail
the day after tomorrow.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.260
You're going to Beijing
the day after tomorrow?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.140
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.820
You said you were at hospital.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.740
You meant a hospital in Beijing?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.740
Why didn't you tell me

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.260
when I said I'd be here for a summer camp?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.860
(Episode 22: So near yet so far.)

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.020
(Please cooperate with
the explosion proof security check.)

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:10.740
Zhao Fanzhou!

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.580
Watch out!

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:23.100
Surprised?

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.580
Shocked?

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.260
Moved?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.060
Don't you watch out for cars
while crossing the street?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.820
It's 1:00 a.m.,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
but you're outside alone.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:29.820
What if anything happened to you?

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.340
I didn't even know you came here.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.180
Are you mad at me?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.460
Don't be angry.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.500
I just wanted to give you a surprise.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.980
Are you really mad at me?

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.420
You're not mad at me?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.860
I am.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:03:00.660
(Busy)

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.900
I'm so tired.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.660
I kept writing and writing

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.900
so that my fingerprints
were almost rubbed off.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.580
And my boyfriend was not by my side.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.100
When he's finally back,

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.740
he's mad at me.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.580
Why am I so unlucky?

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.260
I also have a sore throat.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.940
My ankle is aching.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.260
I...

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.460
I came out by climbing over the wall.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.740
My ankle is twisted.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.140
It hurts.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.660
I climbed over the wall to see you.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.300
Please don't be mad at me.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.860
Who asked you to do that?

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.300
What if you fell down?

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.660
Impossible. I'm good at sport.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.660
I couldn't fall down.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.060
I...

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.700
I'm sleepy.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.180
I need some sleep.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.620
Good night.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.020
(Busy)

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.900
I don't want it.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.820
Here we are.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.940
Give me a second.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.100
I'll go explain it

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:16.500
to the dorm supervisor.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.700
Are you still mad at me?

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.700
Yes.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.020
Please don't be angry. Okay?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.060
No.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.500
Look.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.740
I didn't mean to do it.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.460
I...

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.100
I've drunk water as you said.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.220
You can't be mad at me anymore.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.100
It's a different matter.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.980
What are you doing?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.980
I just put a spell on you.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.180
To stop you getting mad.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.580
You smiled.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:34.100
No.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.340
You did.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.780
You got it wrong.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.540
I heard it. You smiled.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.260
I said no.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.700
You did. I heard it.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.060
Jealousy

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.980
makes women unhappy.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.180
It's shown

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.260
particularly clearly

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.900
in female crime.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.500
Besides,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.100
it becomes

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.820
an emotional barrier for them to reform.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:10.940
Research reveals...

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.220
When did you go to bed last night?

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.340
I stayed up all night.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.380
I slept for only two hours.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.020
Go back to your dorm

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.540
and have a good rest.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.980
No way.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.300
I won't wake up if I fall asleep.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.060
I have to make everything clear

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.940
in the ending of the story

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.060
during the next few days.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.340
Why are you in a hurry?

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.460
The writing summer camp

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.980
in Beijing

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.620
asked us to hand in a work.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.620
They said if my work was good enough,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.660
they would recommend it to publishing houses.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.380
If my novel is published,

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.060
it will prove my life is worth living.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.460
Research on psychological remedies
to female crime

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.860
has been carried out for long.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:57.260
There are also

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.380
many psychological remedies.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.380
You want to lose your eyesight?

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.700
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.940
Tell me

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.420
which remedies

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.020
aiming at female crime

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:21.660
have been introduced from abroad?

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.260
Psychoanalysis,

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.500
cognitive therapy,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:26.580
behavior therapy

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.100
and client-centered therapy.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.700
It seems you're listening to me

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.340
while dating a girl.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.900
But the rest of you had better
not follow his example.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.700
You're not as capable as him.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.340
It's okay that

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:48.420
you take your girlfriend here,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.660
but you should avoid

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.220
getting too close in class.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.540
Alright.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.300
You have a lot of time
to do that after class.

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:58.980
It's all your fault.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.860
Besides the four therapies

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.300
Zhao Fanzhou mentioned,

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.260
there are some other ways

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.740
to deal with female crime.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.180
That's all for today.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.300
You're dismissed.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.220
Thank you, professor.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:25.980
I've finally done writing.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:26.940
Let's go.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:29.780
What are you doing?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.140
Why are you holding a book?

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:37.860
You're...

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.780
What's wrong?

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.380
The medicated oil.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.620
Hold on. I'll get you some tissues.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.860
Let me wipe it for you.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.140
I'm sorry.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.300
I'll treat you to lunch. Okay?

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.500
Why do your tears keep coming out?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.460
Can you walk by yourself?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.820
No.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.100
Someone will take photos
and post them on the internet again.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:26.180
Last time,

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.740
a photo of us was posted
below your Weibo account.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.100
You lost about half of your fans.
Aren't you worried?

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.260
It turns out you followed
my Weibo account in secret.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.380
That's not the point.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.020
The point is you've lost a lot of fans.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.580
I don't care.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.420
No big deal.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.100
I'd expected so before I posted the photo.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:42.860
Wait.

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:46.820
You'd expected so before you posted it.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:47.980
Right.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:48.940
That is...

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:53.300
Xie Yixing.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.300
You have one more chance to tell the truth.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.500
Okay.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.460
I posted the photo with my private account.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:01.500
Xie Yixing, you...

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:01.980
Excuse me.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.220
Welcome to experience our life education.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:03.860
Thank you.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:06.140
Xie Yixing!

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.300
Stop looking at the leaflet.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.100
Could it

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.460
be better-looking than me?

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.380
Explain to me

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.180
why you used your private Weibo account

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.260
to post our photo.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:23.740
Because

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.580
I want everyone to know that

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:26.540
you're my girlfriend.

00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:28.300
Why do you want everyone to know that?

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.980
Because I like you so much.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.460
Nobody confesses his love on every occasion.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.260
Sorry?

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.540
Louder please.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:42.100
Repeat it.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:46.700
Tao Ling!

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.300
Here.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:47.940
Hey.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.580
Come over.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.540
Because I like you so much.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:51.980
Do you know?

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.340
What's up?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.780
Why are you looking so sad?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.140
Fang Wei said

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.340
he'd have lunch with me,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.140
but he suddenly called and told me

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.300
his mentor wanted
to discuss a project with him.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:06.780
He can't make it.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.380
Never mind.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.260
We'll eat with you.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:12.980
Then

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.620
I want to have ribs.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.260
I also want chicken wings.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.460
Lu, your boyfriend is staring at me.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:38.860
Eat.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:44.300
Wait. It's mine.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:46.820
Fang Wei stood me up

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:48.060
and you grabbed my chicken wing.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.900
He stood you up again?

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.060
Your hands are not clean, Zhou Xiao.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:57.620
What a poor girl you are.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:58.980
I'll give it back to you.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.340
I don't need it.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.660
You do.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.420
I don't.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:06.140
It's Xie Yixing's.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:06.860
Give it back to him.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:08.060
It's yours?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.060
Give it to me.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:09.820
Here you are.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:16.820
Eat.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.980
Can we have a quiet meal?

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.740
Only Zhao Fanzhou has control over you.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.780
I prefer to eat like this.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:46.700
It gives me a better appetite.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:48.700
Eat more.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:50.900
You need to eat more.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:52.300
You're so slim.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.300
If you keep losing weight,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.060
I'd be able to pick you up with a racket.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:55.900
Ah.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.780
Ah.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:11.820
Xiao,

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.260
I think this is much fun.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:14.260
I'll ask Fang Wei to join us.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.540
How about the three of us going there?

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.260
What is it?

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.980
Do you know how life started?

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.100
No.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.620
Do you think life is tiring?

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:24.620
Not really.

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.260
Have you thought about what you'd say

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.220
at the last moment of your life?

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:28.540
No.

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:29.860
Come to play the game

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.700
and experience the shocking life education.

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:37.900
What is it?

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.060
It's an event held by the Medical School

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.180
for World Suicide Prevention Day.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.140
Let's go there for fun.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:50.980
Don't you need to write?

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.500
Right.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.260
Then focus on writing.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.540
When we come back,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.820
I'll give you

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.940
a vivid description.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.380
Maybe I've already finished writing

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.220
before you go.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.340
I wish you full of inspiration while writing.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:05.220
I'm sure to be full of inspiration.

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:05.700
Thank you.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:07.860
Eat.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:08.380
Okay.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.260
How on earth can I make

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.940
the hero's childhood trauma be healed?

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:19.700
Dad,

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.940
when will my mom be transferred
to a local hospital?

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.380
I'll go pick you up.

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.540
Forget it.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:25.420
(OK. I got it.)

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.620
I'll have him beaten up

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.460
so that he loses his memory.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:29.340
(Dad, when will mom be transferred to
our local hospital? I'll pick you up.)

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.220
What's wrong?

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.700
I have no inspiration.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:33.940
So what?

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.260
So, I need to excite my brain cells.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.580
How?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:40.500
Do you want an ice cream?

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.380
I'll go get ice creams. Wait for me.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.140
Fanzhou.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:13.980
Dad,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.380
I sent you a message on WeChat,

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:17.820
but you didn't reply to me.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.020
I was busy,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:21.780
so I missed it.

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.260
Your mom has been transferred
to a local hospital.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.820
I've gone through the admission procedure.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.180
I planned to tell you
after everything is done.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.540
Why didn't you tell me about the transfer?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.180
I can deal with it alone.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.220
I planned to tell you

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:37.900
after you've done with the registration.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.460
I've already done.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.860
I'll go to see you soon.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.220
Okay.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.980
It happens I'll have
something else to do tonight.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.220
Okay.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:46.460
I'll hung up.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.060
I'll go to see your mom with you.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.060
Were you scared

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.220
by my mom last time?

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.020
No.

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:23.780
It's a similar case
when my mom loses her temper.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:24.700
I'm used to that.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.140
But you have to promise me something.

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:41.220
Okay.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.380
Swap ice creams with me.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.500
The lavender flavored one

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:49.860
tastes like detergent.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:58.540
Why did you buy it?

00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.980
It's a new flavor.

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.060
I wanted to have a try.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.460
Luckily, I also got
a cantaloupe flavored one.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.980
How do you like it?
It tastes like detergent, right?

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.620
I've never had detergent.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.660
I did.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.580
When I was little,
I thought it was milk powder,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.420
so I had some in secret.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.180
It's really a miracle

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.540
that you're still alive.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.700
I was just curious about unknown things.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.380
"I'm Tutu, a naughty boy."

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.100
"I'm curious about everything in the world."

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.140
"I have numerous questions."

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.820
You're the one who is curious,

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:32.140
so you take the responsibility.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.220
Uncle.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:46.500
She has taken diazepam

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.660
and just fallen asleep.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.020
Yichun, thank you.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.500
We're lucky

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.100
to have you here.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:55.820
You've helped us with everything.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.100
You've made things

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.020
convenient for us.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:18:59.980
Uncle, you're too polite.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:00.820
Just let me know

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.220
if there is anything I can do.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.100
I'm an intern here, anyway.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.740
Everything for me is a chance to learn.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.220
Okay.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.300
I appreciate it.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.500
I'm leaving.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:11.700
I need to

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.060
confirm some medical records from Beijing

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:14.300
with Professor Gu.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:14.900
Okay.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:15.780
Thank you.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:16.780
Go ahead.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.620
Oh. Uncle,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:21.660
will Fanzhou be here soon?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.300
Yeah. He'll be here later.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.220
Okay.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.300
I'll update him on the situation.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:27.140
Okay.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.500
Did you tell your mom I would go to see her?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.620
She's asleep.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.180
You said your dad was also there, right?

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.460
Hmm.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:50.500
Look.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.420
Is my outfit

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.860
neat and tidy?

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.340
Shall I go back and get changed?

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:56.980
No.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:03.020
I'd better go back.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.460
My mom prepared me
some special local products.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.100
I'll get one for your mom

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.020
so that she can have a taste.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.060
She's bored, anyway.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:10.740
She can kill time by eating something.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.100
Calm down.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.540
I'm calm.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.100
Really.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.820
Didn't you already meet her

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.300
when you were in Beijing?

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.380
Why are you suddenly nervous?

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.460
I was also nervous last time.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.700
Besides,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.820
after I came back

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.460
and told Tao Ling and other girls about it,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.300
they all scolded me.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.580
They said

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.260
I was not polite enough

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.100
and I should have made full preparations

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.020
to meet your mom.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.660
They also told me a lot
about the importance of

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.980
getting along with my mother-in-law.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.580
I was so scared.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.140
I'm getting more and more nervous.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.060
Mother-in-law?

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.060
You've got the wrong point.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.020
Alright. Don't be nervous.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.820
Relax.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:00.340
You asked me to relax?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.980
Last time when you went to see my parents,

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.060
you were also as nervous
as a cat on a hot tin roof.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.540
Don't make sarcastic comments.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.140
Come on. I need your comfort.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:19.740
Relax.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:20.620
Don't worry.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.220
Shall I buy your mom a bunch of flowers?

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:48.860
Okay.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.180
Excuse me.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.660
Can you tell me

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:54.940
which flowers are suitable for parents?

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.300
For parents?

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:57.780
Right.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.180
This kind of flowers.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:01.100
This kind?

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:01.900
What else?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.180
And

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.060
this.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:18.540
Hold on.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:22.220
Let me get emotionally prepared.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:29.220
Okay.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:29.900
Knock.

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.340
Come in please.

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.940
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.780
I thought

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.420
you were scared last time

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.260
and would never come to see me again.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.780
How could it be possible?

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.740
Last time, the summer camp
in Beijing was finished,

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.580
so I went home.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.140
You don't need to comfort me.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.620
It's normal that you were scared.

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:40.060
Really.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.100
It's not your fault.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.020
No.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.260
You got it wrong, auntie.

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.580
I was not scared at all.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.340
Mom,

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.540
Zhou Xiao has got you flowers.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:56.420
Auntie,

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:57.180
look.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:58.580
I picked them for you.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.300
Do you like them?

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.220
That would be great.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:04.660
They're good-looking.

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:05.980
What are these flowers called?

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:06.860
Carnations.

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.380
Nobody has ever sent me flowers.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.380
Zhao Fanzhou has never done that?

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.940
Each Mother's Day,

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.500
I send carnations to my mom.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.620
It's better to have a daughter.

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.260
Girls are considerate and romantic.

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.500
He's as silly as a goose.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:31.540
Has he ever sent flowers to you?

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.420
No.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.100
Really?

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.020
So, you're like me, right?

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:49.980
It's for you.

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.380
Thank you, auntie.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:53.820
It's fragrant.

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.780
But I think I once received flowers.

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:03.660
Really?

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:04.180
From a boy or a girl?

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.100
A boy.

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:06.820
My good friend. We grew up together.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:07.460
He's called Cai Yasi.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:11.460
Well.

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.300
Why did a boy send flowers to you?

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.700
Is he your ex?

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:19.380
No.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:21.140
He just wanted to play a trick on me.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.100
He's a bad boy.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.660
Give me more details.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.980
When we were on stage...

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.220
Here is a hospital.

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.980
Can you two keep quiet?

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.140
He's really boring sometimes.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:36.980
Really?

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.620
This room

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.100
is bright.

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:06.420
It's not bad.

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:37.820
A fairy is spreading flowers!

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.300
Is it fun?

00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.260
No.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.060
No.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:11.900
Yichun.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.340
Uncle.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:15.500
Why don't you go inside?

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.500
I'm afraid I'd bother your wife.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.180
I think

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.100
she is awake at this time.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.780
Come on.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.340
This photo is good...

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:33.980
Fanzhou,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.060
she is...

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:36.700
She's my girlfriend,

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:37.180
Zhou Xiao.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.260
He's my dad.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.180
Hi, Mr. Zhao.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.340
I'm Zhou Xiao.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:42.980
Nice to meet you.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.980
I've got the medicine.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.060
I'm sorry,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.020
but I'll have a meeting in the office.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.820
I need to rush back,

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.100
so I can't keep you company.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:55.900
It's okay.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.020
Mr. Zhao, please go ahead.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:59.620
Now that you're so busy,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.860
you don't need to come here again.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.020
Uncle,

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.300
I'm going back to my office.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:13.140
Let me see you out.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:13.900
Okay.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:16.220
Fanzhou,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.500
take care of your mom.

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:20.300
Hmm.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.860
Auntie, I'm leaving.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:30.740
Uncle,

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.500
it's the first time you've seen
Fanzhou's girlfriend, right?

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.420
Yeah, but Fanzhou once mentioned her.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:44.020
I didn't expect Fanzhou would say that.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.820
Did he keep

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:47.460
praising her in private?

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.180
I can see that

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:50.900
he likes her very much.

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:53.980
But...

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.660
What's up, uncle?

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.700
You know,

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.420
Fanzhou is

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.300
sensible.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.780
There are a lot of things

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.900
he chooses to digest by himself.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.700
He's afraid he may inherit
this disease from his mom,

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:11.740
so he got a test in secret.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.100
If anything is wrong,

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:16.740
I'm afraid

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.300
he'll break up with her.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:23.980
Yichun,

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.020
can you

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.740
do me a favor?

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.180
Please go ahead.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:32.500
You know Fanzhou well.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:33.460
So,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:35.340
can you try to persuade him

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.620
not to be that stubborn?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:39.940
Uncle, you can trust me.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:41.780
Okay.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.460
Thank you.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.140
Let's go.

(Inpatient Department)

Zhou Xiao.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:29.940
Zhou Xiao.

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.460
What's up?

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.740
Let's go back to school.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.740
Then I'll come back here.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:52.380
I wanna stay here for a little longer.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:53.900
No.

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.580
Go back and rest up.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:58.300
I won't rest up even if I go back.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:30:59.780
I have to keep writing.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.580
So, let me stay here for another while.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.900
You have to go back.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.980
Finish your novel first.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:15.580
Don't worry

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.100
about things here.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:20.580
Alright.

(Inpatient Department)

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.740
Come in.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:37.900
Morning, auntie.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:38.820
Morning.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.060
You're here.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.940
Why are you here?

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:43.020
Don't you need to write?

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.060
You...

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.140
Yes, I do.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.220
Zhou Xiao.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:58.940
Come on. Look.

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.420
No three identical ones.

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:03.900
There are five here.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:04.900
Five.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:05.380
Look.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:07.540
I didn't see it.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.500
Amazing.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:10.460
Then do it like this.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:12.540
Three. Four. Five.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.380
Have more meat.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:17.340

Thank you.

Thank you. Hold on.

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:22.420
Take it.

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.220
Point it at me.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:24.620
Press it.

Shall we do it first?

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.020
Be more patient.

I'll stay here and wait for him.

Anyway, so many of us

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.460
couldn't do it at the same time.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.500
But I...

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.340
Stop.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:50.460
Go ahead.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:55.780
Okay. We're leaving.

Let's go.

but now you wanna do it in the afternoon.

Fine. I don't wanna talk to you.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.700
I don't wanna play either.

Don't keep her waiting.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.740
Not everyone will keep waiting for you.

Ignore her.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:41.140
She had a fight with Fang Wei,

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.460
so she's upset.

Have you waited for long?

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.780
I'm glad you realized it.

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.100
Let's go in.

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.620
Lu and Yixing have started for a while.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.540
I wonder how they're doing.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.180
Go.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.940
How did I come into this world?

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.780
If you have a chance to experience it again,

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.340
you'll be healed.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:07.660
I'm out.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.180
Now that you're here, give it a try.

No.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.180
Give it a try

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:14.540
and I'll promise you something.

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.060
Really?

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:16.860
Really.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.700
Anything?

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.780
It has to be reasonable.
And as my capacity allows.

Excuse me.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:40.540
Aren't you tired?

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:43.660
I...

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.740
I'm a little tired too.

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:53.100
But in this case,
I really feel like I am dead.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.980
Life is a profound topic.

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.980
Why is it speaking suddenly?

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.260
But we're keeping exploring.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.020
I guess

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.500
nobody played the game,

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:19.060
so it wasn't turned on until now.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.420
What are you thinking of?

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.580
What last words do you have?

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:24.540
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.780
Facing the death is
to make you open your eyes,

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:28.940
indifferent to the difficulties of life.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:30.420
What would your last words be

00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:32.300
if you were about to die?

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:42.940
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.660
I think

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.500
we need to break up.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.340
Sorry?

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.980
We need to break up.

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.820
(Next Episode)

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.900
I don't want to break up.

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.860
I'll take good care of her.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.380
And better than you did.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.380
Madam,

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.980
I'm the new part-timer.

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:26.260
I'm Cai Yasi, sophomore of
Department of Computer Science.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.340
I won't eat,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.980
unless you take Zhou Xiao here.
