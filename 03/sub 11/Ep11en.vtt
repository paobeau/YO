Yeah, we talked about that yesterday.

The one who was in the fashion magazine last month, Leila.

Our competitor, Eco &amp; Bebe.

49

Their next cover models are Lee Mido and King of Potatoes.

Really? How did they get them?

51
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.630
Director, we should also get a top star.

52
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.990
Director Jang, whenever I go to meetings,

53
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.000
we get compared a lot.

54
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.090
It's fortunate if I only have my pride hurt, but our advertisements are also stolen.

55
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.420
Okay, I understand.

That's why I also could rely on you.

134
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.970
I was worried most about that.

135
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.220
You also...

136
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.550
went through a moment where your world stopped.

137
00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:46.480
But if you didn't want to hurt me,

138
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:53.310
if you worried about me, then you should have told me sooner.

 - Yes?

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:19.590
Do men also take ovulation inducers?

166
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.090
Yes, it's also a medicine for a male's infertility.

167
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:27.800
Men have to take it 2-3 times a week for three months.

168

I knew it was hard for women, but it must be hard for men, too.

What?

170
00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.740
This time, I'm really going to change my job.

171

Last time, you said you would really do it, too.

Hey! It's for real.

I don't have a reason to stay here anymore.

But they don't usually count one year as career experience, right?

176
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:25.420
Is it better to change jobs after a couple of years or... is it better to look for a new workplace?

177
00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.620
If a place that you want to go picks you, you should switch.

178
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:33.670
The place I wanted to go was here.

179

182

Competitors keep shutting down, so I'm getting a lot of calls about whether or not we'll release an issue for next month.

183
00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.930
Looks like I have to search for a new workplace.

Misery loved company.

185
00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.800
They talk about it every year. It's probably a rumor.

186
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.410
It's because I don't think it's a rumor.

187

We're working.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:50.650
So?

191
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.860
Did you get hurt?

192
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.600
Don't concern yourself.

193
00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.110
Whether my hand breaks or not, what's it to you?

194
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.370
You're someone I know.

195
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.480
Do you worry about and take care of every woman you know?

196
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.760
You really... are a bad man.

197
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.500
Even if I did some wrong, I'm not a bad man.

Look here.

199

You don't know you're bad, right? That's even worse.

200

Why are you doing this to me? Why am I bad?

201
00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:51.920
I don't understand what I did to you for you to say I'm bad...

224
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.720
You said it was so hard that you felt like dying.

225
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.620
That you ended it painfully.

226

You said love is like a miracle.

That you would never let go of the person you love.

228

That's how I think, too.

229
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:19.290
You're going to be in pain because you can't do it.

230
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:23.310
And I'll be in pain because I can't wish for it.

231

If we didn't want children, then we would have no problems.

I don't think she's updated her address.

269
00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:46.730
Then I'm sorry but could you do us a favor for just tonight?

Auntie's watching something else.

277
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.700
Is something wrong?

278
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.420
Why does your face look like that?

279
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.240
You said you were going to watch your drama. If not, leave.

280

How many days has it been that you have looked so sad?

281

What do you mean you knew I would be like this?

How do you know something that I didn't even know myself?

all the pros and cons and all the reasons it wouldn't work?

Have you ever done that before?

287
00:32:26.370 --> 00:32:30.840

I don't think it's something to discuss elegantly over tea.

Let's not do alcohol, since I might hit you.

You know that she's in a rush. You take her time and her opportunities.

She doesn't even have time to be worried about things.

Let's not make her waste her emotions.

How can I support you?

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.820
I'm someone who's allowed to determine whether a guy is not for Hari so

311

I'm going to continue to interfere between the two of you.

Can you handle that for the rest of your life?

313

I'll think of you as someone who comes with Jang Hari as supplemental material.

I'm saying I will block you.

You're unacceptable. I've felt that way since the beginning.

It seems like there were issues from the beginning but there has to be someone

against it, so that she'll rethink it.

318

That kind of mother-in-law, I'll do it.

319
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.490
As a friend or a man?

320
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:43.030
Don't do it as a friend and just face me as a man.

321
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.030
Make your position clear. Because right now,

322
00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:51.230
you're not a friend nor a man.

323
00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:57.040
Okay, we'll see what happens to you later.

324
00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:01.340
Okay. From now on, see on the sidelines

325
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:03.970
what I become.

326
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.940
Oh, you woke up?

327
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.430
Yes.

328
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:43.550
Oh my.

329
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.810
Hello.

330
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:49.570
Trainee Han Yisang, what are you doing here?

331
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.190
I'm waiting... for my girlfriend.

332
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.120
Girlfriend?

333
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.820
Besides my daughter and I, a woman...

334
00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.630
You're Hari's mother?

335
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:12.270
The wench who stole you away is my Hari?

336
00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:16.810
Oh my! Oh, my son-in-law! Oh my, oh my!

337
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.290
How can this be?

338
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:22.370
Oh my goodness!

339
00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.230
Aunt,

340
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.260
do you know him?

341
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:34.570
You two look really close.

342
00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.450
Even holding hands.

343
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:42.030
We're not close, just...

344
00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.590
We just go to the leather workshop together.

345
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.300
'We?' 'Together?'

346
00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.540
N-No. The same.

347
00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:55.070
The same workshop. We go separately.

348
00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.670
Oh my, you really. We aren't of any relation.

349
00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.040
A little earlier,

350
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.860
you called me your son-in-law.

351
00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:10.640
Huh?

352
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.160
Son-in-law?

353
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.530
Huh?

354
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.280
Hari... left for work early this morning.

355
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:23.300
You should also go to work.

356
00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:27.450
You should also go get Doha to the daycare and go to work.

357
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:31.430
I also need to go do aerobics, so I'll be going.

358
00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:48.060
Earlier, Mother said I was her son-in-law.

359
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.950
- Never mind. 
 - Aunt already gave me the okay.

360
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:54.980
From a long time ago.

361
00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.540
Let's just go to work.

362
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.140
I'm going to work right now.

363
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.100
Wow, it's Jung Taehee.

364
00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:29.500
This is my first time seeing a celebrity.

365
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.790
Same here. How could she look so good in purple?

366
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:35.440
- Out of all the celebrities I've seen, she's— 
 - Pretty.

367
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.590
She's pretty?

368
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.030
She is pretty. Looks good in purple. Looks like I won't ever wear purple.

369
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.310
You drink it all. Do well.

370
00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.420
Jung, Jung Tae, Jung Taehee!

371
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.980
- Attention! Attention! 
 - Director, Director!

372
00:40:57.980 --> 00:41:00.200
At the studio, I saw Jung Taehee!

373
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.200
She's shooting with Chief Han.

374
00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.870
Wow! Look at this.

375
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.400
Chief Han and Jung Taehee are best friends.

376
00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.370
We should have been respectful of Chief Han. I think we've been thoughtless.

377
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.970
Seeing how Bo Show is letting Chief Han do the cover when they have their own studio,

378
00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:20.390
it means that Jung Taehee requested him.

379
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:25.340
Oh no! I called Chief Han an idiot

380
00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.270
for taking pictures of the breast pump upside down!

381
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.160
Everything must have been intended!

382
00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.560
Oh, what did I say? How could I? Oh!

383
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.140
Why did you do that? Oh... it's okay, it's okay!

384
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.490
I'm not on his bad side, right?

385
00:41:39.490 --> 00:41:41.490
Oh well... that could have happened.

386
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.990
How is he friends with Jung Taehee?

387
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:46.550
I'm worried. What do I do?

388
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.240
Oh, you surprised me!

389
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240
Let's go.

390
00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:53.420
What? You're going to do the shoot?

391
00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.860
What are the chances of Jung Taehee showing up when you look your worst?

392
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:06.600
Director, let's go.

393
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.200
Why me?

394
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.410
You need to cast Jung Taehee.

395
00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:13.250
Me?

396
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.470
Good. That's good.

397
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.030
Good. Oh, that's nice.

398
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.930
That's it. Okay. Good.

399
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:24.430
Very nice!

400
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:25.880
Psh!

401
00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:29.110
If I also got my hair and makeup done, I'd be like her.

402
00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.530
It would be faster to just be reborn.

403
00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:36.540
Hey, don't be like that. She's like that because she wants to be a celebrity.

404
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:40.790
Okay. Wonder. Okay, good.

405
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.490
Uh... could you touch up her makeup and hair?

406
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:46.590
It's good.

407
00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:48.430
One second.

408
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:51.830
- Chief, I really like this one! 
 - This one, too.

409
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:53.730
You take photos well.

410
00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:58.250
- Look at them! 
 - Why do they keep batting their eyes? Do they have an eye spasm?

411
00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.770
They can't keep their hands to themselves. Why? I ought to break them!

412
00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.440
He belongs to the director.

413
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.130
Should we mark her territory?

414
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.140
Don't hold back.

 - Fighting!

420
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.480
You're the best! Fighting!

You're the best!

422

Hello.

423
00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.650
Hello. I'm "the baby's" Director, Jang Hari.

424
00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.570
Ah, yes. Thank you.

425
00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:11.530
You tried to cast me a few times, didn't you? I believe "the baby" has made a few offers.

426
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:14.860
Of course, we did. You're Jung Taehee.

427
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:18.600
I even reviewed the essay you wrote on infant care.

428

<i> [Dachae Media, Jang Hari] </i>

429
00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.860
Ah...

430
00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:26.970
I'm sorry, but if you're trying to cast me, I'm going to have to refuse.

431
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.920
I don't do interviews unless it's a reporter I know. There are too many who write fiction instead of an article.

432
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.770
Then you can make me a reporter that you know.

433
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.120
I'll be outside for a bit.

434
00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:44.100
Whether you're a reporter or a celebrity,

435
00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:47.310
I think we all look at things with prejudice.

436
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.610
But we don't know each other well.

437
00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:53.760
You should get to know what kind of person I am after talking for a bit.

438
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.620
If I'm trustworthy, you can do the interview then.

439
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:05.630
If it was a favor from Chief Han, then it's another story.

440
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.060
But, what's the relation between you two?

441
00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:15.390
With Chief Han?

442
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.550
Why are you including me?

443
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.600
When the one who is making the effort is Reporter Jang Hari?

444
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:27.200
You can trust her. She's the best out of all the people I've worked with.

445
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.470
While working with mothers, instead of expanding her know-how,

446
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.760
I think she learned how to move a person's heart.

447
00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.750
You don't have to make yourself known.

448
00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.620
Even if you guys don't talk for long, she'll recognize you.

449
00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:10.500

Already? Why?

I didn't say she broke up. I'm asking if she did.

Did she not say anything to you?

Nope.

466

It's unusual...

467
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:25.420
Why did you ignore my warning, called me out at night, buying me chicken, and asking me about the two of them?

468
00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.610

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.780
<i> I don't think so.</i>

480
00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:15.200
<i>Don't stray and come here quickly. I'm so tired.</i>

481
00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.040
<i>What's with the attitude?</i>

482
00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.030
<i>Is this the attitude of a person asking me to bring him underwear?</i>

483
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:25.050
<i>I'm calling you in the world's most polite position ever.</i>

484
00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:28.970
<i>Yoon Jaeyoung, don't ever order me to bring your underwear anymore.</i>

485
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:32.400
<i>If Jungwon knows, she'll feel bad.</i>

486
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:39.160
<i>Jungwon also hasn't gone home for a week. She'll understand.</i>

487
00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.830
<i>I guess she will.</i>

488
00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:11.430
<i>I'm dying.</i>

489
00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.380
<i>Did you sleep?</i>

490
00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:18.150
<i>I should go wash up and sleep at home now.</i>

491
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:26.180
<i>You should go and wash up. You don't have underwear, right?</i>

492
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:29.950
<i>Hari is coming with the change of clothes.</i>

493
00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.870
<i>Jang Hari is bringing your underwear?</i>

494
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.870
Yeah.

495
00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.230
<i>It's just a favor between friends. Why?</i>

496
00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.970
<i>What's wrong with that?</i>

497
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:49.840
<i>Jungwon.</i>

498
00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.160
<i>Is this something to be angry about?</i>

499
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:03.030
<i>If I'm not angry, then we need to break up.</i>

500
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:04.850
<i>Scary words like that exist?</i>

501
00:50:04.850 --> 00:50:08.220
<i>It's really awkward having a woman as your best friend.</i>

502
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.420
<i>Having her coming into my man's house anytime</i>

503
00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:13.690
<i>and touching my man's underwear. How can I understand that?</i>

504
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.420
<i>It's been a month since I've been inside the house.</i>

505
00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:21.350
<i>You're also barely getting any sleep. The only person I could ask was Hari.</i>

506
00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:26.880
<i>Then... is it okay for a male friend to touch my underwear?</i>

507
00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.530
<i>Seo Jungwon, Hari is not a female friend,</i>

508
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.420
<i>but like a younger sibling.</i>

509
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.690
<i>She's not, though!</i>

510
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:39.190
<i>There's no such thing as a sex distinction between us. We've been friends since in the womb.</i>

511
00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.790
<i>Why are you being jealous over something that doesn't exist?</i>

512
00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:43.890
<i>They're fighting.</i>

513
00:50:43.890 --> 00:50:45.840
<i>Yoon Jaeyoung!</i>

514
00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.310
<i>Hold on.</i>

515
00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:53.620
<i>I'm not a fan of this type of relation.</i>

516
00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:57.100
<i>If I marry you, it'll feel like there's three people.</i>

517
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.270
<i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

518
00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:13.350
<i>Are you okay? Geez, really!</i>

519
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.410
<i> It's all visible. </i>

520
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.580
<i>- I'm sorry, Hari. 
 - What for?</i>

521
00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.790
<i>I'll call you.</i>

522
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:36.610
<i>Hey, your underwear. Hey, you crazy man—</i>

523
00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:38.610
<i>Hey, your underwear—</i>

524
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.050
<i>- Please give this to Dr. Yoon Jaeyoung. 
 - Okay.</i>

525
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:52.190
<i>I'll do it. Why can't I?</i>

526
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:55.500
<i>I won't see Hari anymore. Since you're important to me right now.</i>

527
00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:58.650
<i>You think you can do that?</i>

528
00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.860
<i>Hari...</i>

529
00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:06.070
<i>I won't ever see her again.</i>

530
00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.470
<i>I'll do that.</i>

531
00:52:17.530 --> 00:52:20.390
<i>And I call him a friend...</i>

532
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:24.880
Hari heard that?

533
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:31.170
Even if she understands, it still hurts.

534
00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:36.840
And then you stopped contacting her and she had to hear about your wedding news from her mother.

535
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:43.190
If you threw away a blood relative-like friend, you should have lived well!

536
00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.130
I don't know.

537
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.300
I'm going to go after buying chicken for my kids.

538
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:54.070
Excuse me, I'll have a half-fried and half-seasoned to go.

539
00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:55.930
Okay.

540
00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.520
What is it now?

541
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:28.420
Hey.

542
00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.060
When did you put them in there?

543
00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.650
That's true. Why are you doing my laundry?

544
00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:40.930
You should have gotten angry saying you can't and won't do it. Why not?

545
00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:41.870
What's so great about me?

546
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.930
You complain even when I do it for you.

547
00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:46.140
You should have told me to get lost.

548
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.030
You should have never seen me anymore.

549
00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.550
You stupid...

550
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:58.550
Why are you accepting everything like nothing?

551
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.020
I'm sorry.

552
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:15.600
Hey!

553
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:27.630
<i> [Jambi Studio] </i>

554
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.670
<i> Again. </i>

555
00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.330
Okay, just play. Yeah, yeah.

556
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:38.630
Again. Goodness.

557
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:41.210
- Naturally. 
 - Don't do the v-sign!

558
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.170
- Don't do the v-sign. 
 - Kids.

559
00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:45.780
Don't do this.

560
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:47.700
And just have fun.

561
00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:52.010
Did I say you're supposed to do a v-sign or not when taking pictures?

562
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.210
- You said we should! 
 - Uh...

563
00:54:55.210 --> 00:54:58.720
Okay, okay. But you should only do that when you're taking photos with me.

564
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.720
With Mister, don't do that.

565
00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:03.990
We do a v-sign with the "click."

566
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.300
Mister is not doing the "click" right now.

567
00:55:07.300 --> 00:55:10.370
So just play and don't look here.

568
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:12.390
But Mister did "click."

569
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:14.690
- You— 
 - No, no.

570
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.370
I think it'll be best if you don't watch.

571
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.800
Okay, okay. Focus.

572
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.630
Smile. Brightly!

573
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:26.230
That's it.

574
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:27.990
Hello.

575
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:29.900
- Hello. 
 - You came?

576
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:32.660
<i> Okay, come on. </i>

577
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:35.360
<i>Okay, once more! Yeah, once more.</i>

578
00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.010
<i>That's good!</i>

579
00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.870
Eutteum, you said the table changes.

580
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:42.020
Hold on.

581
00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:46.080
Guys, I prepared something amazing.

582
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.100
What do you think I prepared?

583
00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.790
Tada!

584
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:54.250
I'm going to hide this amazing jelly in here.

585
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:57.460
Only the person who finds this does a v-sign.

586
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.290
Okay!

587
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:02.610
Shall we close our eyes? Don't peek.

588
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:07.640
How is he so smart?

589
00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.540
- Eutteum? 
 - What?

590
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.340
N-No. The table.

591
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.430
The table.

592
00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:18.940
Okay, open your eyes!

593
00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:21.360
You can start.

594
00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:25.630
<i>Okay, who's going to find it first?</i>

595
00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:27.640
<i>Can you do a v-sign?</i>

596
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:30.690
Go slowly!

597
00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:32.460
You're going to fall. Stop!

598
00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:33.600
Slowly, slowly!

599
00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:35.100
Did the pictorial go well?

600
00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.590
Hari! They were just troublemakers. Are you not busy?

601
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:42.000
Because of you guys, I'm planning to skip out.

602
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.380
Really? Let's go!

603
00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:49.290
I think I saw him in passing.

604
00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:51.940
When are you going to introduce me to him?

605
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:57.250
Are you happy that you're dating? What do you like the best?

606
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:04.400
Why? Did something happen?

607
00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:10.190
I liked everything.

608
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:16.130
I wanted to be with him and even when we leave I wanted to see him again.

609
00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.060
Out of everything, the thing I liked the most was...

610
00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:26.520
You know those actions that can only be done between people who are really close?

611
00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.190
The way we could naturally touch each

612
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:38.370
<i>other without feeling distant.</i>

613
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.030
<i>He felt like my person.</i>

614
00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:47.560
<i>The small and friendly actions</i>

615
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:52.470
<i>that nobody else saw.</i>

616
00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:57.080
It felt nice to receive love.

617
00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:09.100
Even when I feel small,

618
00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:14.170
he recognizes me.

619
00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.430
He's my person who recognizes me.

620
00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.710
Bu what do I do?

621
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:39.790
That person also has a hard time having a baby.

622
00:58:59.310 --> 00:59:00.570
I'm going to the restroom.

623
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.480
Okay.

624
00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:10.830
<i>[Dr. Moon, Urology]</i>

626
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.810
It was this?

627
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.930
Mr. Han Yisang!

628
01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:13.820
I won't speak long, so you should end it.

629
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.430
Hari has a weak heart, so she can't end it.

630
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:22.460
She'll feel like she's throwing away a sick person. Don't make her take that baggage and leave.

631
01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.490
We will deal with our situation ourselves.

632
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:31.240
If you knew you had this problem from the beginning, you shouldn't have started it!

633
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.350
I started it because I couldn't end it.

634
01:00:40.350 --> 01:00:42.440
You selfish jerk.

635
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.450
Think about Hari. Are you qualified?

636
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.320
What about you?

637
01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.760
Do you think you're qualified?

638
01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.030
<i>[Idiot Jang]</i>

639
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:34.250
Where are you right now?

640
01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.490
What? Why?

641
01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.300
Did you know Han Yisang's problem?

642
01:01:50.910 --> 01:01:55.380
You do? You know and you're meeting him?

643
01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:59.560
How did you know?

644
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:05.230
Let him go. Don't hold onto him with lingering attachment.

645
01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.160
Is it easy for you to throw people away?

646
01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.800
It wasn't.

647
01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.570
It wasn't easy for both you and Jungwon.

648
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:24.230
But at that time, I thought I would regret losing Jungwon.

649
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:29.790
But then why are you telling me to throw that person away?

650
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:37.370
Right now, I regret throwing you away back then.

651
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:43.010
No matter what you choose, you'll regret what you let go of.

652
01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:49.630
Between that person and a baby, think about which one pierces your heart more.

653
01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:54.110
I'm not sure.

654
01:02:54.110 --> 01:03:00.760
Hari, if you date that man, it'll only be harder for you.

655
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:06.800
I'm confident you won't regret it like I did at that moment.

656
01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.460
I want to see that person right now.

657
01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:01.690
I met Jaeyoung.

658
01:04:06.830 --> 01:04:10.080
It's nothing much. You don't have to worry about it.

659
01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:12.650
What are you saying we do?

660
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:21.050
It's a problem that your life depends on.

661
01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:24.640
So we should think about it together.

662
01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.850
I am also going to put my life on the line and do my best to cling onto you, so—

663
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:31.390
What if I say there's no miracle?

664
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.590
What if I say I was wrong?

665
01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.030
Then, what do we do?

666
01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.320
Since we started, we should see it until the end.

667
01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.490
If it was going to be like this, I wouldn't have started.

668
01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.610
I don't have confidence anymore.

670
01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:20.610
Just think about one thing right now.

671
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:28.060
Is it okay to let me go?
