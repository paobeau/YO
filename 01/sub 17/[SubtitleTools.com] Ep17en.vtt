(Previously on Episode 16)
I have even got a name for our event.

16
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.020
It's called

17
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.220
"Help for Depression".

18
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.980

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.300
Thank you for sharing
your secret base with me.

21
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.340
Look at the glorious fireworks
I've prepared for you.

(Episode 17: Gone Lover)

23
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.100
Professor Hu.

24
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.740
Qin Meng.

25
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.700
What are you doing here in the Forensic Lab?

26
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.700
Aren't you going to give a lecture today?

27
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.900
It hasn't started yet.

28
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.300
Zhao told me

29
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.900
he was your assistant, too.

30
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.460
So I came with him to see you.

31
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.820
He's not my assistant.

32
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.500
What?

33
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.620
He's my right-hand man.

34
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.180
You're still the same, Professor Hu.

35
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.540
When I was his assistant,

36
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.700
he tricked me every day.

37
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.220
Nonsense.

38
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.900
Meng, come here.

39
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.740
Fanzhou,

40
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.100
fetch results of the test

41
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.700
we did last week.

42
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.820
Have a seat.

43
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.740
How's it going?

44
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.940
Isn't life busy
at the Judicial Expertise Center?

45
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.540
Not really.

46
00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.060
Do you still write novels now?

47
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.900
Yes. Why?

48
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.860
You still have time to do that

49
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.540
and interest in it.

50
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.020
Professor Hu,

51
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.460
didn't you encourage me to write novels then?

52
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.660
It was just a casual remark.

53
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.340
I didn't expect you
to make it your second career.

54
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.300
Remember.

55
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.940
You're my student.

56
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.500
Don't neglect your original job.

57
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.660
Yes, Professor Hu.

58
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:29.100
Professor.

59
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.180
Look.

60
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.460
By the way,

61
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.940
recently

62
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.220
I read an interesting novel.

63
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.740
It was written

64
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.500
by a student of our school

65
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.220
whose name is Zhou Xiao.

66
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.740
Professor,

67
00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.300
I'm your student

68
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.860
and I write novels, too.

69
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.100
Why didn't you read mine?

70
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.940
Yours are too serious and tiring,

71
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.220
but

72
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.420
the work of Zhou Xiao

73
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.140
from the Department of Chinese

74
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.020
is especially interesting.

75
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.020
When I read her novel,

76
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.020
it felt as if I was sipping wine on a sofa.

77
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.780
Relaxing.

78
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.060
Really?

79
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.260
What did she write?

80
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.020
Its name is

81
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.860
the Cold-blooded Two-faced Medical Examiner.

82
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.420
It's the Bloodthirsty
Two-faced Medical Examiner.

83
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.180
Yes.

84
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.980
Zhao, you read it, too?

85
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.260
He likes it very much.

86
00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.060
He could hardly tear himself away from it.

87
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.740
Really? This novel seems to be popular.

88
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.500
I'll look it up on the Internet.

89
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.140
I find that many students

90
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.700
of our school write novels.

91
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.380
Doesn't your girlfriend write novels, too?

92
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.260
Ask her to come here.
I wanna have her autograph.

93
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.340
She may be a celebrity one day.

94
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.380
Then our Fanzhou

95
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.300
will need to study harder.

96
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.820
Zhao Fanzhou.

97
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.100
Zhao Fanzhou.

98
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.060
Zhao Fanzhou. Zhao Fanzhou.

99
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.700
Open the door.
The person you wanna see most is here.

100
00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.980
Open the door.

101
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.660
Here is your future idol.

102
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.540
Zhao Fanzhou.

103
00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.140
I'm going in.

104
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.700
You said the person I wanted to see

105
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.900
was in the lab.

106
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.100
It's you who wants to see me, isn't it?

107
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.700
Look at me. Quickly.

108
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.740
I need to wait for Qin Meng
at the door of the hall.

109
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.260
No.

110
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.540
No.

111
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.580
Is she your girlfriend?

112
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.460
Professor, I'll go to give my lecture then.

113
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.460
I'll come to see you again.

114
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.380
Don't keep the students waiting.

115
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.540
Have you calmed down?

116
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:52.940
Give me a few more minutes.

117
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.100
It's the first time I've seen my idol.
I'm nervous.

118
00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.260
Ms. Qin is going.

119
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.460
Ms... Ms. Qin, hello.

120
00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.060
I'm from the Department of Chinese.

121
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.620
I like your novels very much

122
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.980
and you're an example to me.

123
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.380
You're Zhou Xiao, aren't you?

124
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.100
How do you know my name?

125
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.460
The Bloodthirsty Two-faced Medical Examiner.

126
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.380
You... you know my novel?

127
00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.060
Oh, I see.

128
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.260
Huh?

129
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.860
Nothing.

130
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.500
You just

131
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.820
impressed me.

132
00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.340
So you read the novel I wrote.

133
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.700
It's because Professor Hu

134
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.780
and Zhao strongly recommended your novel.

135
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.100
Actually I decided to write novels

136
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.860
after reading your works.

137
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.420
That would be a great compliment.

138
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.780
So Ms. Qin,

139
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.580
can you give another lecture

140
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.260
which all students can attend?

141
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.020
Your fans are so envious

142
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.860
of those from
the Department of Forensic Medicine.

143
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.020
I think I can consider that.

144
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.900
Okay.

145
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.420
It's just a lecture. I'll give another one.

146
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.420
Really?

147
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.660
She'll give another one.

148
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.060
But my speech was written

149
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.980
for students
of the Department of Forensic Medicine.

150
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.540
Never mind.

151
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.060
I can help you prepare another one.

152
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.660
But you'll have to give the outline

153
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.140
to me tomorrow morning.

154
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.140
Okay. I can do that.

155
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.060
Are you sure?

156
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.580
Yes.

157
00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.340
It's just a two-hour lecture.

158
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.620
How can she talk about so many things?

159
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.660
You promised quite firmly just now.

160
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.180
It's just like an interview.

161
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.620
You have to say

162
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.540
you can do it

163
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.900
or you'll learn it.

164
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.660
If there's anything

165
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.820
you don't understand,

166
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.860
you can ask me.

167
00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.420
Got it.

168
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.660
But the audience has changed

169
00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.980
from the Department of Forensic Medicine

170
00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.060
to various departments of our school.

171
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.820
I think the content should be

172
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.340
approachable and interesting.

173
00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:14.500
Mm.

174
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.580
Mm?

175
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.540
Just one word, mm?

176
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.740
As my studying companion,

177
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.300
can you be more responsible?

178
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.780
I need inspiration.

179
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.220
Inspiration.

180
00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.460
What?

181
00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.300
Improving your technical skill

182
00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.540
will bring you lots of inspiration.

183
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:02.620
Oh.

184
00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:52.260
Don't stay up too late.

185
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.580
It's all your fault.

186
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.420
Focus. Focus.

187
00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.860
There's only one page left.

188
00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.220
(Don't stay up too late.)

189
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.740
(Don't stay up too late.)

190
00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.020
Is she asleep?

191
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:20.460
Ms. Qin, this way, please.

192
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.420
Hello, Ms. Qin, chairman.

193
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.060
Hello, Ms. Qin.

194
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.780
This is what I prepared yesterday.

195
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:34.060
You've already finished organizing them?

196
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.340
I thought you couldn't give me anything today

197
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.100
so I stayed up late

198
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.020
and prepared one, too.

199
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.620
Looks like it's not necessary.

200
00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.220
Thank you, Ms. Qin.

201
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.940
I'll go back to the auditorium.

202
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.940
Don't.

203
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.980
Just sit beside me.

204
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:52.380
Is that alright?

205
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.180
You prepared this speech for me

206
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.940
and I don't know it well.
What if I make any mistakes?

207
00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.460
But the Student Union
has arranged for a host.

208
00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.220
Can't I have my own opinions?

209
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.180
Of course you can. You got me wrong.

210
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.100
Okay.

211
00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.260
Go on the platform first.

212
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.660
I have to go to the bathroom.

213
00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:12.300
I'll show you the way.

214
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.220
Hello.

215
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.020
Hello.

216
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.180
Zhou Xiao,

217
00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.860
why are you here?

218
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.740
Ms. Qin asked me to sit here.

219
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.660
Why?

220
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.020
I'm the host.

221
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:44.540
You can fetch another chair.

222
00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:48.860
Try to be relaxed later.

223
00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:50.340
I'm nervous. I'm scared.

224
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.100
Just be yourself.

225
00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.060
You can handle it.

226
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.660
Fanzhou, you came at the right time.

227
00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.340
I'm the host appointed

228
00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.300
by the Student Union

229
00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.820
and I hosted the last lecture

230
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:00.700
of Ms. Qin Meng.

231
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.220
But now Zhou Xiao...

232
00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.780
Ms. Qin has told me.

233
00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.620
You'll both

234
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.820
cooperate with her in this lecture.

235
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.860
I'm off. Do a good job.

236
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.900
Okay. Bye-bye.

237
00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.020
Why are you staring at me?

238
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:24.660
Zhou Xiao,

239
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.100
must you steal this from me, too?

240
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.300
Steal what?

241
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.860
Stop pretending.

242
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.860
You said it so genuinely

243
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.020
that you and Fanzhou were just friends.

244
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.020
But then you stole him from me.

245
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.940
When has he become yours?

246
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:41.140
You...

247
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.740
Ms. Qin, this way.

248
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.220
In order to avoid magnetic interference,

249
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.060
please put your phones

250
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.940
in the box.

251
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.940
Good morning, everyone.

252
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.860
I'm your host, Jia Yichun.

253
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.260
You must know

254
00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.500
Ms. Qin Meng very well.

255
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.220
Ms. Qin is...

256
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.540
What's up with Zhou Xiao?

257
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:25.940
What?

258
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:26.900
She looks...

259
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.580
she looks terrible in the video.

260
00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.420
She's quite photogenic.

261
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.020
She will mainly talk

262
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.900
about writing and medical examiners.

263
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.740
Now Ms. Qin Meng will

264
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:43.980
give her lecture.

265
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.500
Hello, everyone.

266
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.940
Before I give this lecture,

267
00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.860
I want to introduce a student to you.

268
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.580
She's Zhou Xiao
from the Department of Chinese.

269
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.580
Good. Good.

270
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.420
She's a bit nervous

271
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.940
but

272
00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.140
my speech

273
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.700
was prepared by her.

274
00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.740
So I just made a decision.

275
00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.740
I decided to change this lecture

276
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.940
into a dialogue

277
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.940
between you and I.

278
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.020
Is that okay?

279
00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.660
For starters,

280
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:25.580
we may not know much about medical examiners.

281
00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.500
But through detective fictions

282
00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.060
and relevant films and TV series,

283
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.220
we can get some new information about them.

284
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:32.580
Medical examiners on television

285
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:33.900
usually

286
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:34.860
wear suits

287
00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:35.980
and look radiant.

288
00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:37.420
But I think

289
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.380
when Ms. Qin is working,

290
00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.260
she must basically live in a pickup

291
00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.500
and always be on the go.

292
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.100
Zhou Xiao is right.

293
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.060
Actually it's in TV series

294
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.540
that you saw

295
00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.140
most analyses of cases.

296
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.020
But in real life,

297
00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.100
it'll just be a few of us

298
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.780
surrounding an 11'' laptop

299
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.740
and looking at it together.

300
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.860
Although it's a bit laborious,

301
00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.380
I think it's pretty good.

302
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:07.740
Because that can...

303
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:39.300
Actually five years ago

304
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.140
when I just went to college,

305
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.620
I thought the same as you do.

306
00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.220
But

307
00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.980
over the five years in NFU,

308
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.220
I changed.

309
00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.500
Ms. Qin,

310
00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.260
just now you mentioned that solving cases

311
00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:03.620
provided you with a lot of things
to write about.

312
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.660
Could you share with us some cases

313
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.780
that have left a deep impression on you?

314
00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.660
Hello. Who am I speaking to?

315
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.980
Hello. Are you Zhao Fanzhou?

316
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.260
Yes.

317
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:21.940
We're trying to save your mom
in our hospital.

318
00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:23.700
Her life is not in danger

319
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.940
but she's not in a good mental state.

320
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:27.740
Please come to our hospital
as quickly as possible.

321
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.140
You're trying to save her?

322
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:29.900
Yes.

323
00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:32.500
The sightseeing bus she took overturned

324
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.180
and her wrist and pubis were broken.

325
00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.060
She's still in a coma.

326
00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.060
Which hospital is it?

327
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:38.620
Haicheng People's Hospital.

328
00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.780
Okay. I've got it. I'll be right there.

329
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:41.380
Thank you.

330
00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:46.540
Actually many cases

331
00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.540
were really abominable

332
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.580
and made us feel angry and sad.

333
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:54.940
But meanwhile,

334
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.140
when solving cases,

335
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.740
we were deeply aware

336
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.500
of those miseries in the world.

337
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.460
So it is a great honor

338
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:04.540
to share these things with you.

339
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.140
When people speak of cases,

340
00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.580
I'll always have strong feelings.

341
00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.020
I'm not from
the Department of Forensic Medicine

342
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.940
(I gotta go. Text me after it's over.)
but I'm a loyal fan of yours.

343
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.660
I read every one of your books.

344
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.940
Every one of them?

345
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.500
Yes, every one of them.

346
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.660
You've read all of them?

347
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.420
Yes.

348
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.780
Which is your favorite?

349
00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.780
I like the Secret Chambers

350
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.180
series most.

351
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.060
One of them is Secret Chambers:

352
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:34.780
Inescapable.

353
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.500
I like that book, too.

354
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.620
Which part do you like most?

355
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.740
The part that the hero

356
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.620
(Block)
was stuck in a bus underground.

357
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.580
He was so scared already

358
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.580
in the darkness.

359
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:48.820
And at such a moment,

360
00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.060
red wine spurted from everywhere

361
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.940
like a fountain.

362
00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.860
And then...

363
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.980
(Block this phone number?)
Red wine spurted from everywhere?

364
00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:55.900
Yes. Yes.

365
00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.220
(Delete message from this number?)
That part is super thrilling

366
00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.980
and the description is perfect.

367
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.020
I like it

368
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.500
when it's eerie and a little bit frightening.

369
00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.100
Actually I myself...

370
00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.460
I'm so much better than her.

371
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.340
Why can Fanzhou never see it?

372
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.460
Doctor,

373
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:19.420
I'm on my way to the hospital.

374
00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.620
How's my mom?

375
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.900
She's still in the operating room.

376
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.820
Okay, thank you.

377
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:28.260
Please drive faster, sir.

378
00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.220
Okay.

379
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:34.900
Zhou Xiao,

380
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.020
thanks for your help today.

381
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.980
Thanks for giving me a chance
to improve myself.

382
00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.380
These are your phones.

383
00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:41.140
Okay. Thanks.

384
00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.580
You're welcome.

385
00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:43.020
I hope we'll see each other again.

386
00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:43.620
Mm. Okay.

387
00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.180
Come on.

388
00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:47.260
Zhou Xiao.

389
00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:49.460
Excellent.

390
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.300
Hello, Ms. Qin.

391
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.620
I'll be off, then?

392
00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:52.700
Bye, Ms. Qin.

393
00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:53.860
Goodbye, Ms. Qin.

394
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.180
Xiao, you were so impressive in the speech.

395
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.420
Your questions were so interesting.

396
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.780
The three of us couldn't stop laughing.

397
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.620
Quickly. I want your autograph.

398
00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:04.500
Enough. Enough.

399
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.100
Not until we're back in the dorm.

400
00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.460
Where's Zhao Fanzhou?

401
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.820
He left in the middle of the speech.

402
00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.380
He may have something to do.

403
00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.460
Give him a call.

404
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.940
Okay.

405
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:18.580
(Zhao Fanzhou)

406
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.500
Sorry! The number you have dialed

407
00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.540
cannot be connected for the moment.

408
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.180
Please redial later.

409
00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.340
Alright, call him while we're going.

410
00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.820
Okay. Let's go.

411
00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.500
Hello, here.

412
00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.980
Are you Shen Mengjun's relative?

413
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.460
Yes. I'm her son.

414
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.220
How's my mom now?

415
00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.060
She's still in the operating room

416
00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.340
but the operation is successful.

417
00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.140
Don't worry. It's not serious.

418
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.980
She'll be transferred to a normal ward later.

419
00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:53.220
Okay. Thank you.

420
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.020
Not at all.

421
00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.180
Wait for a while here.

422
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.820
I'll go in the operating room.

423
00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:57.460
Someone will tell you more about it later.

424
00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.140
Okay.

425
00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.020
Don't worry.

426
00:21:59.220 --> 00:21:59.500
Mm.

427
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:22.540
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

428
00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:24.220
Please redial later.

429
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:32.260
(Zhou Xiao)

430
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.220
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

431
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.180
Please redial later.

432
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.620
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

433
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:45.980
Please redial later.

434
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.980
Zhou Xiao, you still can't reach him?

435
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.540
He didn't answer my calls.

436
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.140
Maybe his phone is out of power.

437
00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:06.060
I just can't reach him.

438
00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:06.820
I feel

439
00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.340
unutterably anxious.

440
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.540
Would he be in the lab?

441
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:13.740
Oh, yes.

442
00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.100
She didn't have her lunch.

443
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.900
Tao Ling,

444
00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.260
do you want to finish up the food?

445
00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.660
No. I want to sleep.

446
00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.660
(Recents
Zhou Xiao(6))

447
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.180
Where on earth is he?

448
00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.620
Was he sold to Africa

449
00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.500
to bathe elephants?

450
00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.100
I hate you, Zhao Fanzhou.

451
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:27.980
I hate you.

452
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.180
Hey,

453
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.500
you almost murdered a national level athlete.

454
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.740
You could be sent to prison.

455
00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.420
I'll be jailed no matter who I murder,

456
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:37.780
whether he's a national level athlete or not.

457
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.540
Okay. See you later.

458
00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:43.340
Xie Yixing.

459
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.300
What are you doing?

460
00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:47.900
Are you really going to murder me?

461
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:48.700
Do you know

462
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.780
where Zhao Fanzhou is?

463
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.900
Fanzhou?

464
00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.460
Aren't you his girlfriend?

465
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.940
If you don't know, why would I know?

466
00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:57.860
That's right.

467
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.740
Are you okay?

468
00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:06.140
What's going on?

469
00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:10.260
(Zhao Fanzhou)

470
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:14.660
Hello.

471
00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:16.580
Where are you?

472
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.060
I'm in the hospital.

473
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.060
My mom had a car accident.

474
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.540
The operation is successful.

475
00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:26.140
Thanks.

476
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.220
Oh, by the way,

477
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.460
tell Zhou Xiao

478
00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.820
that I kept calling her

479
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.700
but I couldn't get through.

480
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:35.940
Ask her

481
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.260
to contact me.

482
00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:40.740
Thanks.

483
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.940
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

484
00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.500
Please redial later.

485
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.980
Ms. Liu.

486
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:20.100
Zhou Xiao.

487
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.740
Ms. Liu,

488
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.860
did Zhao Fanzhou come here today?

489
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.700
He's not on duty today.

490
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:26.860
I didn't see him.

491
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.580
Oh, thank you.

492
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.740
Oh, Zhou Xiao.

493
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.500
Yes? Did you remember where he was?

494
00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.860
No.

495
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.460
I just remembered

496
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.580
that he hasn't returned a book.

497
00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.140
I saw his name when I was making a list

498
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.260
of overdue books today.

499
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.620
Remind him about it.

500
00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.300
Remind him?

501
00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.460
I don't even know where he is.

502
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.300
What did you say?

503
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.900
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

504
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.180
What's the book?

505
00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:52.740
Its name is

506
00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.100
The Psychology of Love.

507
00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.180
What?

508
00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.460
You didn't expect

509
00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.940
he would borrow this kind of book, did you?

510
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.420
We discussed it for a long time

511
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:05.980
and wondered why he borrowed it.

512
00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.340
I could never expect that.

513
00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.540
Ms. Liu asked

514
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.580
since when Zhao Fanzhou

515
00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.300
had been interested

516
00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.260
in love psychology.

517
00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.780
I was only kidding. Did I scare you?

518
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.060
No. I'm okay.

519
00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.820
But

520
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.900
Zhao Fanzhou did borrow that book.

521
00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.220
You've got to be careful.

522
00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.180
Okay.

523
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:29.980
Alright, I'll be seeing you.

524
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:30.980
Okay. Goodbye.

525
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.420
Mm.

526
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.220
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

527
00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.820
Please redial later.

528
00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.340
It's been a tiring day.

529
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:55.620
My arms ache.

530
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:56.380
They do?

531
00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.340
Have an early rest. Don't stay up late.

532
00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.740
Look at Lu.

533
00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.820
I hear Chen Yu dumped her
when they just dated.

534
00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:10.220
So funny.

535
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.140
It's really embarrassing.

536
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.700
She's picking up shuttlecocks there.

537
00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:18.700
Did you come to play badminton, coach?

538
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.020
Or what?

539
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.700
To hear you speak ill of others?

540
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.940
How could you talk like that?

541
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:24.860
That's rude.

542
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.460
I was only talking like you did.

543
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:27.820
How could he say that?

544
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:28.780
Let's go.

545
00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:46.420
Why are you picking shuttlecocks here alone?

546
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:49.060
This is unacceptable.

547
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.100
Did they make you do this?

548
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.020
Tell me.

549
00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.620
Don't you know?

550
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.580
It's my turn to pick up shuttlecocks today.

551
00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:57.580
Ah?

552
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.300
Oh, I forgot to tell you something.

553
00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:17.900
Mm.

554
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.900
Zhao Fanzhou called me

555
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:24.020
and said he was out of town
to look after his mom.

556
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.300
Why did you talk about him with me?

557
00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.100
Zhou Xiao said she couldn't reach him.

558
00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.620
Would Zhou Xiao not

559
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.100
be able to reach Zhao Fanzhou?

560
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.100
I'm wondering, too.

561
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.020
Just remember to tell her.

562
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.300
Okay. Got it.

563
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.340
Is she

564
00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.140
looking for Fanzhou?

565
00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.260
Hello.

566
00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:07.340
Okay, Fanzhou.

567
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.740
Zhou Xiao.

568
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:12.300
Are you looking for Fanzhou?

569
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.020
Yeah.

570
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.140
He just called me

571
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:17.100
and asked me to tell you

572
00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.340
his mom was in hospital

573
00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.100
so he would be away for the next few days.

574
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:21.740
Her mom is in hospital?

575
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.620
Is she seriously ill?

576
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:24.900
Well,

577
00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.940
Fanzhou asked me not to tell.

578
00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:33.420
Hey.

579
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.260
See you, then.

580
00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:36.140
Mm.

581
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.740
Just now chairman called me

582
00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.340
and said we needed to prepare...

583
00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:47.980
You're back.

584
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.460
Where are Wei and Tao Ling?

585
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:53.620
I dunno.

586
00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.340
By the way,

587
00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:59.660
Zhao Fanzhou asked Xie Yixing to tell you

588
00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.140
he was out of town to look after his...

589
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:01.780
I know.

590
00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:03.180
What?

591
00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.980
But Xie Yixing said he...

592
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:06.620
Xie Yixing?

593
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.540
Anyway, I'm the last to know

594
00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.660
he's out of town to look after his mom.

595
00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:20.580
He called everyone except me.

596
00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.540
What's wrong?

597
00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.500
Why did he call everyone except you?

598
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.860
We broke up.

599
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.700
How come?

600
00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.780
Zhao Fanzhou is obviously hiding from me.

601
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.620
He didn't answer my calls

602
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:36.100
or call me back.

603
00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.900
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

604
00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.620
May it be that he's occupied in the hospital

605
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.220
and doesn't have time to contact you?

606
00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.340
Why did he have time to contact others, then?

607
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.620
He had time

608
00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.300
to call Xie Yixing and those

609
00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.100
of the Student Union.

610
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.940
And even Jia Yichun.

611
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:54.740
Xiao, don't be so sad.

612
00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:56.460
Come on, let me give you a hug.

613
00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.060
Quickly. Answer it.

614
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.980
Hello, there's a package for you.

615
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.420
Come downstairs and sign for it, please.

616
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.580
Who is it?

617
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:10.500
Is it Zhao Fanzhou?

618
00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:12.540
A delivery man.

619
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:13.940
I'll go and get it.

620
00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:15.820
Stay here. I'll get it for you.

621
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.900
No. No. No.

622
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.820
I'll get it myself.

623
00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.100
What?

624
00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:58.340
Are you not happy to see me?

625
00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:02.940
Who are you waiting for?

626
00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.300
Zhao Fanzhou?

627
00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.100
Did he hurt you?

628
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.980
How do you know?

629
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.220
(Yiting Book Cafe)

630
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.420
Are you eating ice cream

631
00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:28.340
or your tears?

632
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:30.740
Leave me alone.

633
00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.780
I wish I could do that.

634
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:43.820
Wipe your tears.

635
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:45.020
You're ugly.

636
00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:51.900
(Breakup symptom 1: Self-doubt)

637
00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.620
Am I really ugly?

638
00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.700
Do you think

639
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.820
it's because I'm ugly

640
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.300
that Zhao Fanzhou broke up with me

641
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.580
and didn't contact me?

642
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:09.660
That's possible.

643
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.660
Cai Yasi.

644
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.020
Don't think I'm too sad

645
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.180
to kill you now.

646
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.060
Actually I know.

647
00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.100
You don't have to comfort me.

648
00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.460
Men won't like my appearance.

649
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:23.740
And I don't have a charismatic personality.

650
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.940
Other girls want beautiful faces and hair.

651
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.580
Only I want to know how to kill someone

652
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.100
without being caught.

653
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.860
I wouldn't like myself if I were a boy.

654
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.340
But how could he do that?

655
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:43.420
However ugly I am,

656
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.100
he couldn't tell everyone

657
00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.340
except me.

658
00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:48.380
Am I a stranger?

659
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.180
I'm his ugly and annoying girlfriend.

660
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:57.740
Stop crying.

661
00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.140
If you don't,

662
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.100
people will think I did something to you.

663
00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.460
Aren't you too heartless?

664
00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.980
I was dumped.

665
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.780
I wish you were really dumped.

666
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:08.780
What?

667
00:35:09.580 --> 00:35:10.260
Nothing.

668
00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.180
Can you not think so much?

669
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.500
If you can't get it,

670
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.540
just call him.

671
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.340
No.

672
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.580
I have my dignity.

673
00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.620
Keep crying, then.

674
00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.500
No, I won't cry anymore.

675
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.060
The ice cream has become salty with tears.

676
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:34.980
Let's go.

677
00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:36.340
Where do you want to go?

678
00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.020
Hey.

679
00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.260
Wait for me.

680
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.940
Don't walk so fast.

681
00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.060
Where are you going?

682
00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.700
Let's have dinner together

683
00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:49.300
or do what you feel like doing.

684
00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.220
What's wrong?

685
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.820
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

686
00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:22.380
Please redial later.

687
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:33.940
Sorry! The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

688
00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:35.500
Please redial later.

689
00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:45.180
Why can't I get through to you?

690
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.580
Has Xie Yixing told you what I'm doing?

691
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.820
Don't be angry.

692
00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.860
I'll go back and explain
when things are done here.

693
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.740
Fanzhou.

694
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.860
Fanzhou!

695
00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:03.900
Fanzhou!

696
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.540
You're back.

697
00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:09.460
Mm.

698
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:11.620
Are you okay?

699
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:12.740
Yes.

700
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.620
(Breakup symptom 2: Pretending it's over)

701
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.700
Who am I?

702
00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.700
It's no big deal.
My next boyfriend will be better.

703
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.940
Xiao, cry if you want to.

704
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.380
We're all your shoulders.

705
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:26.540
Don't restrain yourself.

706
00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:29.540
Yes. You'll feel better after crying.

707
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.660
It's alright.

708
00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.180
We won't laugh at you.

709
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:36.060
You can't stop crying
even when watching a TV play.

710
00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:37.740
We've been used to it. Feel free to cry.

711
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:42.060
I've just cried. I can't cry now.

712
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.100
You cried without us outside.

713
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.300
That's not what a friend should do.

714
00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.460
It's because of Cai Yasi.

715
00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.140
He asked me something

716
00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.820
and I couldn't help it.

717
00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:51.740
It's okay.

718
00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:53.500
We bought a lot of delicious things.

719
00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.540
Let's eat and release all our emotions.

720
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.420
Look.

721
00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:59.220
Cai Yasi also bought her many things.

722
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.420
Well, we can eat them together,

723
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:05.260
though I ate some just now.

724
00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.380
Who on earth are your bosom friends?

725
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.420
You are.

726
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.740
Of course you guys.

727
00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.820
Looks like you're okay now.

728
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.580
Yes. I've got over it.

729
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:15.900
Okay.

730
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.020
That's a good thing.

731
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:18.180
I'll take a shower.

732
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:18.700
It's so hot.

733
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.340
Wait.

734
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.300
Let me do it first
or I'll have to wait for ages.

735
00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:23.020
I'll shower first. I'll shower first.

736
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.740
It's time I studied.

737
00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.700
Where are you?

738
00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.620
Why didn't you answer my calls?

739
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:03.460
Call me. I'm worried about you.

740
00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.700
I'll be angry if you don't call me now.

741
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.900
Mom, the temperature should be alright now.

742
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.300
Fanzhou,

743
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:34.620
don't look at your phone.

744
00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.180
Focus on looking after me, okay?

745
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.060
Okay.

746
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.980
Wanna drink more of it?

747
00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:41.420
Mm.

748
00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.980
The doctor said

749
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.660
you could leave here in two days.

750
00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.660
Dad will pick us up then.

751
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.540
What does he come here for?

752
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:57.300
I didn't die.

753
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.020
He must be disappointed.

754
00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:02.260
Mom.

755
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.420
Fanzhou,

756
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.300
do you know why...

757
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.020
why he hates me so much?

758
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:13.580
Mom,

759
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.020
calm down.

760
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.100
You thought too much.

761
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:21.340
Calm down.

762
00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.740
How's your mom?

763
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:30.660
Is it serious?

764
00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:39.700
Sorry!

765
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.260
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

766
00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:44.340
Please redial later.

767
00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.380
Sorry!

768
00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.900
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

769
00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.500
Please redial later.

770
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.860
My mom is not seriously hurt

771
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.540
and she'll be discharged
the day after tomorrow.

772
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.580
Your phone seems to be broken.

773
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.860
I can't get through to you.

774
00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.340
I'll tell you the details when I'm back.

775
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.860
Hello.

776
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.380
Are you Shen Mengjun's relative?

777
00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.220
Yes, I am.

778
00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:24.060
Here's the thing.

779
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.140
When your mom was taken here,

780
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.740
she wasn't badly injured

781
00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.180
but she suffered from emotional instability.

782
00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:31.660
So the doctor had to give her a sedative.

783
00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:33.220
Now our psychiatrists

784
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.900
want to assess her

785
00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.660
so I came to tell you about it.

786
00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.460
Okay.

787
00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.420
Besides,

788
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.780
the patient is still unstable now

789
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:42.700
and needs to rest.

790
00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.380
Don't let too many people visit her.

791
00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.380
I've got it. Thank you.

792
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.020
Mm.

793
00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:59.540
(Breakup symptom 3: Extreme anger)
He still made no reply.

794
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.100
Why?

795
00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.540
Why?

796
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:03.740
How can this man be

797
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.580
so vicious?

798
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.980
Zhou Xiao, it's still early.
Don't go mad now.

799
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.020
Quickly. Come here.

800
00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:46.460
Girls,

801
00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.540
it's time for revenge.

802
00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.740
What?

803
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.900
Are you okay, Zhou Xiao?

804
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.300
Wow, they've all been set out. Come on.

805
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:06.380
Grab everything you want.

806
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.540
Don't hesitate.

807
00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.060
Okay. Thanks.

808
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.540
I want this. This.

809
00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.140
And this one.

810
00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:13.780
And that one.

811
00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.420
I want every one of them.

812
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.420
Is she crazy?

813
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.660
They're still not enough, are they?

814
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.500
Would you like some more?

815
00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.980
No. My tray is full already.

816
00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:51.020
We can't finish all these things.

817
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:52.460
No, thank you.

818
00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.420
(Name: Zhao Fanzhou)

819
00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:04.220
Does anyone want a free lunch?

820
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.180
My treat.

821
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:13.820
(Next Episode)
There's not a single person I can't locate.

822
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:16.660
Then why do you disappear
and disconnect from her?

823
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.540
I think I'm the one who couldn't
get in touch with her.

824
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.900
Why do you bring me here?

825
00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.540
