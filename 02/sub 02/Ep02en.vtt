3
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.170
I found you.

4
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720
Yoon Ji Soo.

5
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.420
<i> I found you. Yoon Ji Soo. </i>

6
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.460
I should have found you earlier.

7
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.460
I'm really late.

8
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.450
Find me? What are you saying?

9
00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.670
We had ended it, that's all.

10
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.430
How could I not try to find you?

11
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.900
Back then, when you had to hide,

12
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.930
I both understood and resented you for it.

13
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.870
But breaking up like this, not being able to do anything

14
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.900
and feeling helpless,

15
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.760
it hurt all my life as if a fishbone was stuck in my throat.

16
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.990
Sorry,

17
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.170
but I don't really remember the old days.

18
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.870
And truthfully, I don't really remember much about you either, Sunbae.

19
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.200
Thank you for what you did about the school incident.

20
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.280
And I apologize about your son getting hurt.

21
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.680
His name is Yeong Min, you said?

22
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
He seemed like a nice and lovely kid.

23
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.580
I don't really know yet why the children fought like this.

24
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.200
So let's bury it. And there's nothing you should feel sorry

25
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.780
or thankful for.

26
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.200
Well, anyway. Thank you.

27
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.170
I'll be going.

I think that's mine.

66
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.980
I found you. Yoon Ji Soo.

67
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.700
You know my name?

68
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.500
It was written in big letters on the music score.

69
00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.480
Ah, you memorized it.

70
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.370
It's because of the handkerchief since it's an expensive one.

71
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.080
It doesn't look that expensive.

72
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.990
It's a present my mother gave me for getting into university.

73
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.140
Ah, I'm sorry. I was going to give it back, anyway.

74
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.760
It's fine, you keep it.

75
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.280
Why?

76
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.110
It has your snot and hair grease on it. It's dirty.

77
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.640
It didn't touch my hair. You called me just before I could tie it.

78
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.670
And it's a gift from your mother, so how can I take it?

79
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.340
I have five more since it was a set.

80
00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:01.470
So stop loitering around our department room and go study.

81
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.630
- But no one was studying. 
 - What?

82
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:09.390
The sunbaes are doing protests all the time, and the freshmen are drinking. No one is studying.

83
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.330
You only learned the bad things, I see.

84
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.470
We study a lot. We read books and go to seminars every day.

85
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.980
Then if I also study diligently, will you date me?

86
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.580
N-No.

87
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.230
The cassette tape.

88
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:41.620
It had fallen down on the lawn last time.

89
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.440
I didn't listen to it.

90
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.040
Give it to me.

91
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.250
But, if the chords are too difficult, why don't you change the key?

92
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.390
Forget it.

93
00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.400
But I memorized all of it.

94
00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.920
Still, forget it.

95
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.850
I don't want to.

96
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.710
The song was nice, and the you from inside the tape was better.

97
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.210
You seemed more human.

98
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.130
And contrary to when you're doing protests, you also seemed quite cute.

99
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:20.120
You ... From now on, don't act like you know me.

100
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.070
You claim you don't remember?

101
00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:42.870
When you carry around that handkerchief that's over 20 years old?

102
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.750
Do you really think I don't remember?

103
00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.180
I remember it all, even the song.

Are you two in the flirting stage ("some") or something?

Would a married couple use separate rooms?

And if this is adultery, you definitely wouldn't.

We are not like that, we are just friends.

118
00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:39.220
Don't make me laugh. How can a man and a woman be friends?

119
00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.930
Of course they can. Female friend.

120
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.950
But how do you know so well, Elder? You even know what "some" is.

121
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.900
I watch dramas every day before the 9 o'clock news.

122
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.750
And the stories are all about these things. People commit adultery and slap each other,

123
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:57.810
and sometimes, they even slap each other with kimchi.

124

Aigoo, goodness.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:35.270
Can I take a look?

127
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.350
Just a moment.

128
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.040
Point some light at it.

129

I got it.

133
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.950
Your family is very worried, aren't they?

134
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.580
They said it's fine and I can take my time coming home.

135
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.950
That's good.

136
00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:11.050
Seeing your child, your husband seems like a good person. Can I ask what he does?

137
00:17:11.570 --> 00:17:13.510
He's a lawyer.

138
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.190
Oh, I see.

139
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.940
Then he must have majored in law like I did. Is he from our school?

140
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.770
Sunbae,

141
00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.110
I'm not comfortable with this conversation.

142
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:39.030
I am grateful for yesterday and today,

143
00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.970
and if you need compensation, I will give it to you. And that's it.

I hope that we end this as fellow parents of students at the same school.

And it's awkward for me to hear about the past that I can't even remember well.

Right, you can feel that way.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:37.990
No, I was just wondering if it's hard to live (on a lawyer's salary).

161
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:41.050
<i>They should be paid decently, I guess.</i>

162
00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.940
If one is a human rights lawyer or a government employee,

163
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.750
they could be struggling economically, right?

164
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.300
<i>Hey, are you getting fired, perhaps? That old man is kicking you out?</i>

165
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:54.270
<i>This is why I kept advising you to have some money saved up on the side.</i>

166
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.620
Oh, you punk. Never mind.

167
00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:09.410
♫ <i>Worries that we’ll grow apart during winter</i> ♫

168
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:15.330
♫ <i>Heart-aching nights from the longing</i> ♫

169
00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:21.710
♫ <i>Our season at this moment</i> ♫

170
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.800
Secretary Kang.

171
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.780
Yes?

172
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.230
The person who dropped this handkerchief...

173
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.770
Oh, you had that, Vice President? I was looking for it so I could throw it away.

174
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.100
What kind of work did you think the owner of this handkerchief did?

175
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.390
I'm not sure. She had a bunch of 500 mL bottles of water. Maybe she sells things?

176
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.900
Anyway, you know those typical ajummas? Rough, with a hearty face.

177
00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.230
But she was actually quite beautiful. I imagine she was quite popular when she was young.

178
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.770
Find more out about that ajumma.

179
00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.170
Pardon?

180
00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.920
Oh, Vice President, come on. Is it because I said she was beautiful?

181
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.780
You want to do nothing when we almost hit an innocent person?

182
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.900
Is that a person's duty? Did I teach you to be like this?

183
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.770
No, no.

184
00:21:04.530 --> 00:21:06.480
But I have no information at all.

185
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.880
- I have some.
 - You do?

186
00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.380
She is a parent at Joon Seo's school.

187
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.730
What? Really?

188
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.620
<i> Nursing Ward </i>

189
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.740
<i> I've tried to talk to Yeong Min, </i>

190
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.140
<i> but he won't say why he did it. </i>

191
00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.230
Yeong Min isn't saying anything.

192
00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.470
He's such a gentle boy, like a cotton ball.

193
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.710
But he threw a chair at someone.

194
00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:55.240
And I'd forgotten about that completely.

195
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.880
From yesterday evening until now.

196
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.120
I'm a really bad mom, aren't I?

197
00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:11.900
It snowed then, of all times.

198
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:16.940
And so much, so maybe that was why.

199
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.330
Those damn seasons really take a toll on you.

200
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.990
It would be nice if we only had one.

201
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:31.600
But since there are four,

202
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.710
and each one of these four is pretty and makes your heart flutter,

203
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.520
the seasons come in holding that person's hand.

204
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:45.730
One day, it's the wind,

205
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.040
another day, it's flowers,

206
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.140
and another day, it's rain.

207
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.550
I close my eyes, trying to not see it, but it comes to my thoughts even more vividly.

208
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.610
I drink out of sorrow,

209
00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.430
and then he appears in my dreams without warning.

210
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.420
He would appear even when I drank every day,

211
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.450
so I couldn't live.

212
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.480
No.

213
00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.020
Actually,

214
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.750
that's why I could live.

215
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.790
I imagined our reunion over a thousand times,

216
00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.320
but among all of these, none of them were like yesterday.

217
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:57.820
Why, of all times, did we meet again at the moment

218
00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.130
when I was the most pathetic and miserable?

219
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.730
It's my wife

220
00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.830
and my daughter.

221
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.900
They are beautiful, aren't they?

222
00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.600
Still, I was happy to see Sunbae.

223
00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:00.180
So I understand  how much you must be hurting, Dad.

224
00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.850
<i>Vice President, Madam is here.</i>

225
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:40.130
Stop there.

226
00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:49.180
Are you doing charity?

227
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:52.210
Haven't you made enough donations and such, already?

228
00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.500
Tell me in a way I can understand.

229
00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.980
Who said you could let such a thing go?

230
00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.710
Who told you to show mercy?

231
00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:00.770
What, should I have put him in jail?

232
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.530
Of course. How dare they touch my son?

233
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.290
It doesn't merit this kind of reaction. And he's still a young kid.

234
00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.330
The fact that he's a kid is a bigger issue.

235
00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:12.090
That kid is bullying others at such a young age!

236
00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:14.750
Did you not think of what could have happened if

237
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.180
he had been severely hit by the chair?

238
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.730
Verify with Joon Seo first. Make sure he didn't do anything wrong.

239
00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.740
Even if he did, I don't care.

240
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:25.940
It annoys me to death that a thing like him is attending the same school and benefitting from free lunch there.

241
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.110
Settlement? Mercy?

242
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.270
There won't be any of that, ever!

243
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:34.060
You will be doing a disservice to Joon Seo.

244
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:37.670
There are things I've seen and heard (about what you did last time), so please do not do this again.

245
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.320
<i> Lee Yeong Min's mom, let's meet up. </i>

246
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.050
I don't like to beat around the bush, so I'll say it directly.

247
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.850
I wish you would quit your position as the parents' representative.

248
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.710
It will be awkward if we get involved, so you should tell the school that you don't want to do it anymore.

249
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.020
It's not like I was doing it because I wanted to, so I can do so.

250
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.970
But can I ask the reason?

251
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:28.320
I heard about Yeong Min, but it isn't entirely because of him.

252
00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.450
The problem is with you.

253
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.130
You should keep the lies to a minimum.

254
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:40.060
Being a divorcee is a matter of your private life, so I understand that you could hide it.

255
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:44.290
But don't you think working at a supermarket is a bit much?

256
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.400
You were doing a protest in front of the supermarket's headquarters.

257
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.400
Yeon Yi's mom said she saw you. Was she mistaken?

258
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.310
Do I have to tell all of you

259
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.000
about my private matters?

260
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.840
You shouldn't have deceived us, at the very least.

261
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:02.230
If you felt I was deceiving you, I am sorry.

262
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:06.900
I didn't want to say it if I didn't have to, because I was afraid it would cause prejudice against Yeong Min.

263
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.560
Honestly, wasn't it because you were ashamed?

264
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.320
You knew that you didn't match with us.

265
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:19.620
I think it's true that I didn't match with you.

266
00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:23.180
Being the parents' representative and the hotel brunches were burdensome to me.

267
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.380
Very well then, I will tell the school.

268
00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:29.150
Hold on. Why are you so bold? Aren't you going to apologize?

269
00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:33.210
You've already forgotten? I told you just 30 seconds ago.

270
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.360
<i>Lee Se Hoon</i>

271
00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.710
What is the problem?

272
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:03.160
What is it that you couldn't say over the phone?

273
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.380
Aren't you being rude? You didn't even knock.

274
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.370
Manners are for other human beings, you see.

275
00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.150
Is there anything going on with Yeong Min?

276
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:16.780
There is nothing.

277
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.020
Really?

278
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:19.960
Nothing's wrong.

279
00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.800
That is strange.

280
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.890
Then, why has Yeong Min's phone been turned off for two days now?

281
00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:30.140
You haven't tried contacting him?

282
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.840
He contacted me with his friend's phone to say that his phone is broken.

283
00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.630
I see.

284
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.600
From now on, let's have such conversations over the phone.

285
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.270
I can't see your eyes when we're calling.

286
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:49.720
Eyes do not lie.

287
00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:56.230
I won't be coming here anymore.

288
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:00.930
Figure out how to detect a lie through the voice.

289
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.850
<i>Floor 1, Room 6 
 Prisoner #2931</i>

290
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.220
If you agree to a settlement, an acquittal is possible.

291
00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:23.140
I won't settle.

292
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.820
<i>Summer 2004</i> 
If your intent is verified, you could receive a prison sentence.

293
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.880
Your actions do not merit that at all.

294
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.200
It wasn't an accident, and it wasn't a mistake.

295
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.820
He downplayed the accident and mocked the survivors.

296
00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.960
He was neither remorseful nor apologetic.

297
00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:46.970
So I acted with clear intentions.

298
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.940
I will let the whole world know

299
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.440
exactly what he did.

305

<i>Open your eyes! Open your eyes!</i>

308
00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.750
It's about the lady you asked me to look into yesterday.

309
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.290
Yes, did you find anything interesting?

310
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.950
She is a divorcee.

311
00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:55.110
Sh-She's divorced?

312
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.220
Yes, since three years ago.

313
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:59.220
That's not possible.

314
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.510
In her family register, it is just herself and her child.

315
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:03.740
So that means she is raising her child alone?

316
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.530
Yes, it appears so.

317
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.130
Okay, and her ex-husband?

318
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.820
Is he paying child support?

319
00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.190
Her ex-husband is lawyer in a law firm.

320
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:15.640
During the divorce proceedings, in her battle for full child custody,

321
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.590
she forfeited both child support and alimony.

322
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:21.390
Does she have a job?

323
00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.780
No, she doesn't quite have a job.

324
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:26.580
It seems she does some part-time work here and there.

325

<i>Please make sure to turn on your headlights</i>

326
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.960
Hello, Teacher.

327
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.120
<i>Did you call me earlier?</i>

328
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.660
Yes, Yeong Min's phone is off.

329
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:15.100
I was wondering if something happened.

330
00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.680
<i>Nothing happened. He was good in class, too.</i>

331
00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.080
Is that so?

332
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.120
<i>I'll tell Yeong Min to give you a call.</i>

333
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:26.300
Yes, please do.

334
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:30.460
And... I have one more thing to ask.

335
00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:33.020
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

336
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.480
If Yeong Min's dad calls,

337
00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.630
can you keep Yeong Min's situation a secret?

338
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.200
I don't want him to worry.

339
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.250
Yes, thank you.

342
00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:18.650
It seems I lost all sense of fear since I hurt my head.

343
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:22.310
Since that was your fault, please understand.

♫ When the day brightens into dawn ♫

♫ The red sun rises ♫

Also, how are we going to deal with the temporary workers that have been protesting for almost a month?

351
00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:16.690
I think you have to make a decision.

352
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:19.350
What do you think we should do, Director Park?

353
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.560
Well, we didn't do anything to breach the contract.

354
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:26.670
But those people are saying the contract itself is unjust.

355
00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:30.240
- So, I think we should handle it by law— 
 - You should read the room a bit.

356
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.310
Those people are mainly housewives in their 40's and 50's.

357
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:39.270
These days, if we just blow them off, they can start petitions and other bothersome things.

358
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.360
Then, what should we do?

359
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.610
Just leave them alone.

360
00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:47.070
The mood is cheerful and peaceful, they seem like ajummas enjoying a picnic.

361
00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.950
I doubt they would break down the company doors and storm in.

362
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.330
Right.

363
00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.620
Talk to the legal team and bring me a plan!

364
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.830
Stop asking me as if it were a quiz.

365
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:00.980
Okay.

366
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.510
We're going to buy time pretending to negotiate and then forcefully disband them.

367
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.870
Illegal labor protests, trespass of property, disruption of business, etc.

368
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.130
Collect anything that might back up the forceful disbandment.

369
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.100
Yes.

370
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.690
Why don't you marry, Mister?

371
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.940
Or have you already tried it before?

372
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:46.570
Are you saying a good looking guy like you didn't have anyone?

373
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.820
I'm sure he had someone.

374
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.860
You couldn't choose because there were too many, right?

375
00:36:51.860 --> 00:36:54.280
I had one, but

376
00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.700
she didn't realize it for 25 years because she only looks forward like a horse at a derby.

377
00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.580
It's not too bad.

378
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:09.320
At least she doesn't ask to break up.

379
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.250

 - Excuse me?

- You don't look finish— 
 - Hope you have good business!

382
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.250
- Let's go. 
- Fighting!

Why are they cheering for you?

384
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.950
For me to have good business.

385
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.220
Is it that noticeable that I drink a lot?

386
00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:53.260
It's kind of noticeable. You kind of smell like alcohol, too.

387
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.160

It's you, right?

391
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.360
It is you. The beauty queen who came to see Jae Hyeon.

392
00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.150
Did you come to see him again?

393
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:15.920
Yes, I have something to give him.

394
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.860
Give it to me. I can give it to him for you.

395
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.000
I don't want to.

396

What club is it?

399
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:40.010
A philosophy club called Philosophy Solidarity.

400
00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.340
The name is kind of...

401
00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.550
The name is kind of grandiose, but we just study philosophy.

402
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:46.320
I don't know much about philosophy.

403
00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.570
We don't really know either. That's why we're learning.

404
00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:55.410
It's a non-major-specific club, so you can join, too.

405
00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:58.350
Jae Hyeon is the main speaker, so he comes into the seminar every week.

406
00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:02.530
Jae Hyeon is usually in the club room more than the Law Department.

407
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.720
Is that so?

408
00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.370
We write notes here telling people where to come.

409
00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.600
Oh, it's Sunbae Jae Hyeon!

410
00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.480
That's Jae Hyeon's favorite pub.

411
00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.670
I can find out where he is if I look here.

412
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:24.730
Some people use code to hide where they're going.

413
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.360
But generally, everyone's welcome.

414
00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.460
It's an "Everyone who wants to drink, come out. Let's drink to our death" kind of feel.

415
00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:36.100
Oh, Jae Hyeon is also a regular at this bookstore.

It's hard to say.

430
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:29.170
Then what kind of books does he usually buy?

431
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:03.960
Oh, what a coincidence!

432
00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.590
Do you come here often, too, Sunbae?

433
00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:07.630
- Move. 
 - What?

<i>But although we did not separate, we cannot hold each other's hands.</i>

She sure is consistent.

462
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:04.200
Why won't she wear gloves, anyway?

463
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.580
Her clothes are so thin, too.

464

It's for me. Ow, ow, what?

Why would you guzzle down a whole bottle of liquor like that?

- Then what should I do?
 - About what?

This isn't the time for me to be doing this.

471
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.460
It wouldn't be enough to be completely alert, but I keep thinking about it.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.730
Did you go to buy some water and end up drowning? Why aren't you coming?

475
00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:29.220
Why aren't you coming? Come quickly, geez.

476
00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:38.370
Thank you.

477
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.590
Here.

478
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.660
Let me carry this for you to your door.

479
00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:49.960
No, please don't.

480
00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.800
It's quite heavy.

481
00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:55.980
Thank you.

482
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.430
Don't mention it.

483
00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.640
Have we met before, by any chance?

484
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:03.200
I have a very common appearance, so I hear that a lot.

485
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.660
No, it's not that common.

486
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:12.360
Is that so? But why do people say that? How strange.

487
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.600
Goodbye, then. Be well.

488
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.110
- You've worked hard.
 - It was nothing.

489
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:37.690
She went inside, so shall we go now?

490
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:40.810
- Yes, let's go.
 - Yes.

491
00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:44.500
But may I ask what your relationship with her is?

492
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.120
No, don't ask.

493
00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.020
Yes, sir.

494
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.990
- Hey, Joon Woo.
 - Yes?

495
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:53.940
Starting tomorrow, come here to work for the next few days.

496
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.940
I'm sorry?

497
00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.970
See where that woman goes and what she does.

498
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.490
Yes.

499
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:06.000
It's not stalking, it's not a crime. Think of it as good intentions.

500
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.080
Yes, I understand.

501
00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:15.500
She's a junior from my college. She was smart and a good person.

Yes.

No need to tell her about it.

523
00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:34.300
Yes, of course.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.120

Yeah.

527
00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:50.850
Yes, Vice President?

528
00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:52.400
Yes, are you looking well?

529
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.840
I am looking well, but Yoon Ji Soo right now...

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.430
What now?

531
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.410
She is in front of our company right now.

532
00:50:58.410 --> 00:50:59.770
What?

533
00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:03.060
<i>Dismissal is Murder! Withdraw the Dismissals!</i>

534

<i>Yeong Min, you are reading my messages, but you won't reply?</i>

535
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:11.910
<i>This is cheating, you know.</i>

536

<i>Murderous Corporation Hyeong Seong, Chairman Jang San...</i>

Shall I keep watching her?

538
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.590
Let's stop now.

539
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:28.770
I understand.

540
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:32.120
Good intentions, bulls**t. We are stalking her.

541
00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.010
Sorry for asking you to do this, Joon Woo.

542
00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.270
Oh, not at all.

543
00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:43.040
- Shall I cancel your engagement today?
 - What engagement?

544
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.050
The President of Seoul Bank.

545
00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.940
Well, I suppose I should work.

546
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:49.280
Yes.

547
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.900
It's pretty.

548
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:07.110

549
00:52:07.110 --> 00:52:08.840
Such B.S.

550
00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:10.800
But he cuts a fine figure, he could be an actor.

551
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.330
- He's young, but he's already a vice president.
 - I know.

552
00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:16.350
- Don't you know this?
 - What?

553
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.850
He is CEO Jang Seo Kyeong's husband. Jang Seo Kyeong, Jang Seo Kyeong.

554
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:22.100
Oh, that's right.

555
00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:24.670
The chairman fiercely opposed their marriage.

556
00:52:24.670 --> 00:52:29.870
But Jang Seo Kyeong threw a fit like she would die, so they finally got married.

557
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:32.600
He went to prison in the chairman's stead and was recently released, I think?

558
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:34.040
What? Where?

559
00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:37.780
- Let me see.
 - Hey, come on, hey!

564
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.630
I will never agree to a settlement.

565
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.480
Please call a hearing regarding school violence.

566
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:34.070
But his father said we must not.

567
00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:37.400
So you should have stopped him, Principal.

568
00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.370
Even if Joon Seo's grandfather came, not Joon Seo's father, you should have blocked it.

569
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:46.010
I apologize. I did tell him in earnest that we must not do that.

570
00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:47.730
But he said he was still a young student, so—

571
00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:50.200
I'm saying this just so you don't misunderstand

572
00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.680
but even if my child was not the victim, I would have asked you to follow procedure.

573
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:59.480
To just overlook these kinds of incidents is a bad look for the school.

574
00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.700
And this school should seem more special than other ordinary schools, shouldn't it?

575
00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:07.840
Wouldn't that be the reason that parents are sacrificing a lot to send their children here?

576
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:13.630
And it's the same reason that I donate such a large amount to this school.

<i>Mother, what shall we do?</i>

580
00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:50.120
Has something happened?

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:54.620
<i>It seems a hearing for Yeong Min will be opened regarding school violence.</i>

582
00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.620

<i>It seems she is not interested in any kind of compromise.</i>

587
00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.010
I understand.

588
00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:19.340
Then, could I receive the contact information for his father? Can you tell him I will call...

589
00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:23.490
<i>I'm sorry, I can't tell you his contact information either.</i>

590
00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:24.930
<i>I'm really sorry about this.</i>

591
00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:29.830
Then when will the hearing take place?

592
00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.840
This will be a big opportunity for Seoul Bank as well.

593
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.610
I understand. Go ahead and proceed.

594
00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:44.690
Thank you.

It's alright, please take it.

596
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.190
Then please excuse me.

597
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.950
Yes, what's the matter?

598
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:59.540
<i>Dad, are you with Mom?</i>

599
00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:01.000
No, why?

600
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.140
<i>I wanted to ask Mom what happened.</i>

601
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:07.620
What are you talking about?

602
00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:12.050
<i>They are opening a hearing regarding school violence because of Mom.</i>

603
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:17.820
President of Seoul Bank?

604
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.980
Got it.

605
00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:24.630
What scam is this boy pulling?

606
00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:32.080
May I meet with the CEO, by any chance?

607
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:34.910
- Do you have an appointment?
 - Actually, no.

608
00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:37.900
Then you cannot meet her. You have to make an appointment.

609
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.630
But is she upstairs, in any case?

610
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:42.550
I cannot tell you.

611
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.620
Then what about Vice President Han Jae Hyeon?

612
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:50.300
It is the same for him as well. You cannot meet them without an appointment.

613
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:52.610
Oh, Yeong Min.
 <i>(T/N: It's rural custom to call a mom by her first child's name)</i>

614
00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:55.820
What's going on?

615
00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.060
You cannot do this here.

616
00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:02.150
But this isn't about the protest. Please let me at least call them.

617
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:03.900
You cannot do this here, please come out right away.

618
00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:06.100
No, it's not that...

619
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.630
- No...
 - Out, right now.

620
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.670
What are you doing?

621
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:12.920
I definitely told you to not do this again.

622
00:57:12.920 --> 00:57:14.390
And why must I do that?

623
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:16.750
This isn't a big enough deal to ruin someone's life over.

624
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:22.000
Firing employees and suing them for disrupting business is easier for you than eating a meal.

625
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.150
Why would you care about anyone else's life?

626
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:27.360
He's just a child. He's only 14 years old.

627
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:33.700
You must have fired a truckload of heads of households who have children who are even younger.

628
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.600
I just want to follow official procedure.

629
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:40.620
I'm not trying to just punish the boy who touched my child.

630
00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:44.260
Although, I can't say that is 100% true.

631
00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:58.410
So, Yeong Min, please tell me why this happened.

632
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:02.160
It doesn't matter if they open a hearing regarding school violence.

633
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.950
Why doesn't it matter? You liked this school.

634
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:09.190
You said you liked the teachers and the lessons were fun.

635
00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:14.090
Yeong Min, I do not think that you were really in the wrong.

636
00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:18.170
I did that just because I was annoyed. Everything is annoying.

637
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:22.750
Just because? You can do that, just because?

638
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:28.520
I'll be in eighth grade soon. I'll be an eighth-grader.

639
00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:31.590
They say this is how "eighth-grader disease" (puberty) is.

640
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:34.320
But how can you do that, even if you are almost in eighth grade?

641
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.850
But tomorrow is the day that Dad comes. What do we do?

642
00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:14.200
<i>Mom</i>

643
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:23.680
<i>Mom...</i>

644
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.450
<i>Apartment Building #2</i>

645
00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:00.890
Where is Seo Kyeong?

646
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:04.490
Oh, she just left saying she will go to the school.

647
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.300
You have nothing to worry about.

648
01:00:39.300 --> 01:00:43.520
I will make sure that nothing gets leaked.

649
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.990
Of course you should. To be honest, being rumored as the victim isn't a good thing, either.

650
01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.600
Yeong Min's mother.

651
01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:19.730
I request that you please give this one more thought.

652
01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:24.430
- A child's future—
 - I am doing this for the sake of your child's future, ma'am.

653
01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:29.000
Isn't it the duty of adults to correct the child when he does something wrong?

654
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.330
Having committed a crime, refusing to accept punishment and just getting past it,

655
01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.300
that cannot be good for the child's education, can it?

656
01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:39.290
And what about the way it looks to the other students as well?

657
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.000
If, by chance,

658
01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:49.070
your intention to reopen the hearing is because someone touched your son—

659
01:01:49.070 --> 01:01:51.460
What did you say?

660
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:55.070
Please take your anger out on me instead.

661
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:59.200
The crime of having raised my child badly lies with me.

662
01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.080
So I will accept all your anger or insults, or whatever else.

663
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:12.310
Whatever else, you said?

664
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:16.750
Yes. Whatever else, all of it.

665
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.910
Then, give it a try, whatever it is.

666
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.840
Whatever it takes to quell my anger.

667
01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.050
Please.

668
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:11.830
Just once, please show me your mercy.

669
01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.150
Get up, please.

670
01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:30.980
What are you doing right now?

671
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.190
Get up, Yoon Ji Soo!
