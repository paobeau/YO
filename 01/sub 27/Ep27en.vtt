(Previously on Episode 26)

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.940
Perhaps we're really not
suitable for each other.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.900
Come to have lunch with me.
Just the two of us.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.420
OK.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.380
Fanzhou, why do you suddenly come back?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.740
In my son's mind,
you're more important than himself.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.460
(Episode 27: The Love Circle)

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.540
(Have you got up? I am downstairs.)

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.180
I'm feeling a little bit unwell
out of a sudden.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.340
No, I can't tell him this.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.180
How should I respond if he keeps asking me

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.460
what's wrong with me?

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.620
(Have you got up? I am downstairs.)

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.940
I'm going to work on my new novel,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.380
so I won't attend the class with you.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.860
Sorry about that.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.860
(I'm going to work on my new novel, so I won't attend
the class with you. Sorry about that.)

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860
(Nancheng Lefang Amusement Park)

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.220
Then come down to fetch your breakfast.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.340
Leave it with the dorm keeper.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.860
I will go fetch it later.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.540
You'd better attend the class now.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.460
Don't be late

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.060
Madam,

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.940
I will put the breakfast here.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.900
It is for Zhou Xiao from Room 415.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.140
Just leave it there.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.180
Thank you so much!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.420
Ling,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.660
cheer up!

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.060
Don't worry. I'm fine.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.220
Look,

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.020
he is waiting for you.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.180
Wei,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.860
let's go.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.420
Just leave her with her dear one
whom she dare not get close to.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.940
Why are you here?

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:23.740
Do you know what time it is?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.700
Why are you still having the breakfast

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.100
I brought you this morning?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.020
The food can't be wasted.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.820
You were afraid to meet me downstairs,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.620
so you didn't come down
to fetch the breakfast, right?

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.820
How do you know that?

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.900
Since we made up with each other,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.100
you have been avoiding me.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.380
No, I haven't.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.020
I ...

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:48.780
I'm just in a hurry for class.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.620
Let's go.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.980
Where are we heading?

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.700
I will attend the class with you.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.260
Why do you want to attend the class with me?

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.180
Since you wouldn't accompany me
to attend my class,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.940
I have to accompany you to attend your class.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.380
My class will be quite boring

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.460
for you.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.220
It won't.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.940
Just go.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.340
Shall we go to the amusement park

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.380
after class?

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.100
Why shall we go to the amusement park?

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.460
To make up for the fireworks
you missed last time.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.940
Why do you want to make it up to me?

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.220
What is the problem?

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.220
Let go of my hand.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.620
Just let go of my hand.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.220
Look, they are all laughing at me.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.820
Why are you so obedient?

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.660
So agreeable and coordinative?

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.580
I will ask for your opinions about everything

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.300
in the future.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.260
I only occupied one seat for you.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.860
Maybe I should go sit in the back row.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.780
I can't bear to see anyone show love
in front of me right now.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.260
You don't have to.

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:18.380
I will go there.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:18.980
You sit here.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.540
Xiao.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:27.980
You really needn't do this.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.300
Miao, please hand out these to everyone.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.260
This is a Tripartite Agreement.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.780
Please keep it well.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.740
Please return it to your counselor

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.340
after it is signed by your employment unit.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.580
Another one is

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.940
the questionnaire of employment intention.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.100
Through this, the school wants to investigate

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.340
every student's employment intention

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.020
in order to facilitate
the arrangement of job fairs.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.580
You need to fill in the forms here

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.980
and turn them in once you are finished.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.940
Wei,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.700
since you've secured the postgraduate
recommendation, will you fill it in?

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.820
I will fill it in to prepare for the future.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.300
Great!

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.980
Do you think it will be late for me
to start preparing

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.820
for the postgraduate entrance exam now?

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:20.580
Of course it won't be late.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.900
I suggest you study with me

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.180
every day in the coming days.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.860
OK.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.980
Wei.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:26.820
Wei,

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.620
since you have been recommended
to be a postgraduate,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.420
why do you need to keep studying?

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.660
Human beings need to keep studying, right?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.420
Yes.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.260
You are right.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.700
Do I need to complete the form?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.620
Just fill it in.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.860
Once you complete it,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.220
you may submit it to your department.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:10.380
We will get started with our class

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:12.180
after you all finish.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:15.700
For this class, we will learn

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.660
the narrative prose
in the Pre-Qin-Dynasty Period.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:21.380
In terms of narrative prose
in the Pre-Qin-Dynasty Period,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.180
first of all, I need to introduce

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.660
The Book of History
and The Spring and Autumn Annals.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.940
The Book of History is the earliest extant

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.620
collection of prose in China.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.820
Originally,

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.620
it was the historical documents
of the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties,

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:35.860
and it mainly records

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:36.340
the orders,

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.020
and speeches of the emperors.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:40.260
Later it became

00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.860
one of the Confucian classics.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:43.900
In the field of literature,

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.700
The Book of History

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.420
is the symbol

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.540
of the formation

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.340
of the ancient Chinese prose.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.540
And The Spring and Autumn Annals,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.940
is the first extant

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.100
brief dynastic history book in China

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.940
written in the annalistic style.

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.540
Listen carefully.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.820
It is believed that...

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:01.860
OK.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.780
... the author of The Spring
and Autumn Annals is Confucius,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.340
and its language

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.340
is concise and rigorous.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:08.780
And

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.460
simultaneously,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.060
the author's thoughts and intentions

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.180
are all contained in the words.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.580
The linguistic characteristic
of making suggestions

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.820
and expressing praise or criticism
with a single word

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.220
is called

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.780
the narrative method
of the Spring and Autumn Annals.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.100
(Preferred Location)

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.380
You two can go out for entertainment,

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.580
and we will go to the cafeteria.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.900
We will go to the cafeteria as well.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.380
I won't go to the canteen with you

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.460
because I will feel upset

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.860
whenever seeing couples now.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:55.860
You...

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.180
That's right.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.300
We're leaving.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.580
Then...

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.300
Let's go.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.740
Shall we go to the amusement park

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.380
this afternoon?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.220
Well, uh...

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.900
I will ask Lu if they would like
to go together

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.980
as they also missed the fireworks last time.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.940
But I want to go only with you.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:29.980
Professor.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:31.740
Let's go.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:32.500
Let's have the meal outside the campus.

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:32.940
Fanzhou.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.340
Why are you still in the school?

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.060
Professor.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:41.580
I...

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.100
Professor,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.940
you also know that we will go
to the amusement park?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:44.500
Let's go together.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.020
You will go to the amusement park?

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:48.500
Yes.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.580
Professor Hu,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.260
I'm sorry.

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.780
Why are you saying sorry suddenly?

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.180
Fanzhou asked for a leave from me today,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.380
saying that something has happened
to his family.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.820
Has anything happened to your family?

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.220
Nope.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:08.460
You have made great progress

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.220
and even learned to lie

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.060
for dating.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.540
It seems that

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.300
love can change everything.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.940
It seems that love

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.340
can change everything.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.580
This is the so-called change.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.780
We were supposed to go to the amusement park,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.620
but we are cleaning the lab now.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:32.540
Take a break.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.940
I will do the rest of the work for you.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:36.660
You should do all the work

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.660
because you got me involved into this.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.020
Fine, I won't get you implicated.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.260
Go take a break.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.780
You have been living a happy life
since your childhood.

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.220
I was not sure

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.740
whether I could give you
such happiness or not back then.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.380
Even if there's a possibility of 0.01%

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.180
that I'm unable to give you happiness,

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:12.620
I shouldn't get you implicated

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.660
and let you share my burden.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:19.700
♪It's a promise made

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.020

I think

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.100
we need to break up.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:29.940
Sorry?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.540
We need to break up.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.700
Are you hit?

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.380
Are you OK?

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:45.820
I am fine.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:49.580
Let me help you.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:50.460
No need.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.140
What's wrong with you?

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.780
Does it still hurt?

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.420
No.

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.620
You're lying.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.060
It is bleeding.
How can you say it doesn't hurt?

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.100
You bit me.

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.180
Why are you crying?

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:53.380
It is because of

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.060
you.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:10.700
Have you finished venting your feelings?

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.900
Can you tell me the reason now?

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.220
I'm afraid.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.460
I'm afraid you'll break up with me suddenly.

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.020
Why do you think so?

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.820
You suddenly invited me
to the amusement park,

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.580
saying that you will make it up to me.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:39.980
That is because you were

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:40.900
so upset

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.820
failing to watch the fireworks

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.060
when we were in the amusement park last time.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.140
Then,

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.340
why didn't you

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.140
write down

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:49.540
your intended city

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.860
on the questionnaire of

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:51.500
employment intentions?

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:52.900
Which city do you want to go?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:55.660
I leave it blank

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:56.940
because I will go

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.180
wherever you go.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.060
So why did you

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.700
tell Professor Hu that something had
happened to your family

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:03.660
when you asked a leave from him?

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.340
When I asked you,

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.780
you turned aside from the topic.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.300
I couldn't tell Professor Hu
I wanted to ask for a leave

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.580
because I would take my girlfriend
to the amusement park, could I?

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.340
Then,

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.140
Then...

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.100
Then what?

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:22.060
I'm still afraid you will

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:23.300
break up with me suddenly.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.380
So what should I do

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.100
to make you believe me?

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.740
I don't know.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.820
Let's go register for marriage, OK?

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:04.100
It is unnecessary

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.860
to make such a fuss.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.020
You've

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.220
finished with the medicine.

00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:16.500
I would go throw out the waste.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.700
You didn't answer my question.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:25.780
What question?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.260
How do you like getting married?

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:32.900
We are too young

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:35.100
to think about marriage.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.620
We are about to graduate soon

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.260
and we should make a plan for our future.

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.060
Really?

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.820
Could it be possible that

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.700
you have never thought about our future?

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:53.300
Yes, I have.

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.380
Then tell me about your plan.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:58.340
Why should I tell you first?

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.660
You should tell me first

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.460
as you mentioned it first.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.580
After graduation,

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.460
whichever city you go for work,

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.900
I will take the medical examiner test
of that city.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.740
What will you do if the city does not

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.620
recruit any medical examiners?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.660
If the city doesn't recruit
medical examiners,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:16.740
I will take the exam
of the neighboring cities.

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:17.940
It's not a big deal

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.940
to spend more time on the trip.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.100
When one year passes after our graduation,

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.020
and our work becomes stable

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.500
as well as our income becomes stable,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.020
we can consider

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.900
buying a small house for marriage.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.420
From the perspective of infectious diseases,

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:37.180
I'm not going to raise any pets.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:38.860
But considering you have such interests,

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:40.980
I agree that

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:41.980
you can raise a few cats.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.220
When three years pass after our graduation,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:46.060
we will buy a bigger house.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:47.980
By then,

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:49.580
we may consider

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.740
giving birth to some babies.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:51.540
How many should we have?

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:51.980
Just stop.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.020
What's wrong?

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:55.500
I believe you.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:56.780
You can stop talking now.

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.140
You talked

00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.500
too much suddenly.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.740
It made me scared.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.340
So what's your plan?

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.380
I...

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.020
I want to be

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.420
a famous novelist.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:13.700
I hope the books written by me

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.620
will sell well in both domestic
and overseas market.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.340
If this dream is unable to come true,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.500
I will find a cushy job

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.260
so that I can enjoy my life to the end.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:25.700
Is that all?

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:26.780
Yes.

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:29.980
So what about me?

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.460
What about you?

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.140
In your plan,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:36.580
where am I?

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.020
You will be written

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.300
in my novel.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.420
Don't look at me like this.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.380
As you know,

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.540
I'm not good at developing a plan.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.180
We'd better follow your plan.

want to murder me.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.560
I dislike both of you.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.240
Are you trying to murder me?

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.480
Absolutely not. Don't move.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.320
Don't move.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.080
Listen to me. Without my hands here,

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.040
you must have strangled me.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.040
So loosen your grip.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:02.680
Believe me.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.320
Humph!

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:03.760
I'm still afraid.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.680
Fine! Fine!

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.040
Wei, help me please.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.120
She's almost strangling me.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.320
I can do it well.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.280
Let go of me. Let go of me

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:19.560
Look,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.400
that's how I tied it.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.160
Let me do it. Let me do it.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.040
I can do it, I can do it.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.880
Please stop her.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.800
Don't come over.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.520
I can do it.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.200
I don't believe you.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:36.920
Hello.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.120
Where have you made it?

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.560
Could you please not urge me?

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.120
Take time with your makeup.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:45.200
I'm not urging you.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.440
Just make yourself more beautiful.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.360
Ask Zhou Xiao what she wants
to eat for breakfast.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.480
Fanzhou is asking what Zhou Xiao
wants to eat for breakfast.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.680
Zhou Xiao,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.880
your boyfriend Fanzhou is asking
what dumplings you want to eat.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.360
I like cabbage dumplings.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.440
I'd like chive dumplings.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.640
I'd like cabbage dumplings, too.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.000
Have you heard that?

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:03.280
Yes.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:04.600
What about you?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.360
What do you want to eat?

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.240
Corn dumplings.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.440
OK.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.000
I'm going to hang up. Muah.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.600
You've heard that?

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.120
One portion of corn dumplings,

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.680
two portions of cabbage dumplings,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.360
and one portion of chive dumplings.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.560
Wait, wait. Wait a moment.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.600
We've arrived. Stop here.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:20.480
Come on.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.480
Here you are.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.360
I'm leaving.

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.800
I'm gonna see my new partner Cai Yasi

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.400
to discuss the important matter of my life.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.320
Goodbye!

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:45.760
What's wrong?

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.800
Your make-up is too light.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.080
Sit down to refine your make-up.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.960
Right.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.960
Lu, how about you put on the stage make-up?

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.080
Right. That'll be good.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.760
Is my makeup light?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.640
Why shall I put on the stage makeup?

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.280
You will attend the graduation ceremony.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.920
Besides, you will come onto the stage
to receive the award

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.040
conferred on the outstanding graduates.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.920
You must put on the exquisite makeup.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.080
You two

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.440
will also receive the awards
for the outstanding graduates,

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.160
but you are wearing light makeup.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.080
Luo Wei's grandpa will come.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.720
Her grandpa doesn't want her to wear makeup.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.600
In my case,

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:18.000
makeup won't make me look better.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.240
Hurry to put on the makeup!

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:19.680
Hurry up!

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.200
Hurry up!

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.840
Then I will

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:22.840
apply more mascara?

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.920
That's good. Put on more eyeliner.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.920
Apply more eye shadow, too.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.200
Well,

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.800
it is getting late.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.920
I will go to the school gate
to wait for my grandpa.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:38.320
OK.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.960
Just go.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.400
After all, among all of us, Luo Wei's grandpa

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.480
is the only family who will attend
our graduation ceremony.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.240
Let's meet in the auditorium later.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:45.800
OK.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.280
Goodbye!

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.800
What are you doing?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.960
Of course I am tying it for you.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.600
Can you do it?

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:52.280
Yes, I really can.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:53.800
Well,

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.080
are you sure your parents won't come?

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.000
Yes, I am.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.000
My mom said that I didn't pass
the postgraduate entrance exam

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.320
and would go back home
to live with them and work,

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.560
so she doesn't want to see me.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.600
She feels vexed upon seeing me.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200
My parents are both abroad
and can't come back.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.960
How about your parents, Zhou Xiao?

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.520
I

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:13.000
haven't told them

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.040
there would be the graduation ceremony.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.720
Why?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.200
I have made up with Zhao Fanzhou.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.160
But they still don't know it.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:21.960
You two have been back in love for long.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.080
Why haven't you told them?

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.280
I want to save trouble.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.040
Moreover,

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.280
based on my dad's temperament,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.480
he will definitely scold me when he knows it.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.360
If you handle it this way,

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.520
they will smell a rat

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.480
and find it out sooner or later.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240
I can't care so much.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.520
I will hide it from them
for as long as possible.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.760
Why are you tying it
in the way of wrapping a gift?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.920
The more you look like a gift,
the better things will be.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.240
Redo it.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.520
No, I won't.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.520
Are you sure there will be no problem?

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.320
This will be the shiny moments of my life.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.880
Nothing can be allowed to go wrong.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.880
Don't worry.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.680
I can handle your business in two minutes.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:53.560
Are you sure?

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:54.520
Of course I am.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou, nice to see you!

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.200
-Yasi. -Yasi.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.240
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Zhou.

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.400
Hello! Hello!

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.600
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.440
have you caught sight of my parents
on your way here?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.320
Haven't your parents gone to celebrate
your grandpa's birthday?

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.520
Why haven't they told you?

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:10.840
I don't know.

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:13.920
Well,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.480
your parents might not
want to make you angry.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.880
I am waiting for them at the school gate.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.880
How can I not be angry?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:22.880
Well,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.160
that's why your parents
asked you to wait for us.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.320
They said that you could show us the way
at the same time.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.400
Yes. Right.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.120
Well,

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.840
how could your parents be so shaky?

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.000
You won't be the same, will you?

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.600
How can you say his parents are shaky?

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.720
My daughter Zhou Xiao is a real shaky person.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.920
She is so flakey

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:42.000
that she failed to remember
when the graduation ceremony would be held.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:42.400
Right?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.240
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.080
you are Zhou Xiao's parents, right?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.040
Yes.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:46.560
Yes.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:49.360
Zhou Xiao lives in the same dorm
with my girlfriend.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:50.760
Really?

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480
What a coincidence!

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.640
The bigger coincidence is that

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.960
Zhou Xiao's boyfriend Zhao Fanzhou
is my roommate.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.240
I beg your pardon?

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.400
Haven't they broken up with each other?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.320
Yes.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.640
But they have got back together,
haven't they?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.120
Stop talking!

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.040
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.600
I, I have left my laptop in the dorm.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.560
I must go back to fetch it.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.600
Yasi, stop!

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.800
Make it clear to me!

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.400
Tell me the truth!

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.040
Zhou! Zhou!

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.160
Where are you going?

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.760
What shall we eat?

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:23.440
I don't know.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.880
Don't always think about food.
Try to lose some weight.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.480
Sorry!

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.720
Chop-chop!

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.120
Did it get dirty?

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.040
Someone trod on my trencher cap.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320
How can you blame me for this?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:42.600
Fang Wei.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.160
The ceremony is about to commence.
Where are you going?

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:55.800
It has been a long time.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:57.800
Let's go.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.360
The ceremony is about to kick off.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.160
You go in first.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.080
I will have a chat with him.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:09.720
All right.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.000
Yes, it has been a long time.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.640
How have you been recently?

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:24.680
The same as usual.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.960
I heard that you passed the postgraduate
entrance exam of Haicheng University.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.760
Congratulations to you!

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:31.760
It is Haicheng University.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.520
Even Luo Wei dare not aim at it.

00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.280
Thank you!

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.120
I heard that

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.320
you didn't pass
the postgraduate entrance exam.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.080
It doesn't matter.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.200
You don't need to put on
such a sympathetic face.

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.200
It is quite normal for me

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.400
to fail in the postgraduate entrance exam.

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.600
I couldn't persist in my study.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:49.840
It would be odd if I passed the exam.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.000
Well,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.520
if you still want to take the exam next year,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.760
I can tutor you.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.200
No need.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.720
It is not my aspiration.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.760
I took the postgraduate entrance
exam back then

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.160
in order to hold my head high
in front of you.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.160
However,

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.280
I have thought it through.

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:08.480
I don't need to prove myself to you.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.080
Tao Ling,

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.520
I am sorry!

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:20.920
That's all right.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.720
I have already forgiven you.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.200
And you don't need to take it to heart.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.440
I have got over you.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:33.680
They are waiting for me.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.600
I will go join them.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.160
Happy graduation!

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:48.520
Happy graduation!

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.400
(Nanfang University
2020 Graduation & Degree Awarding Ceremony)

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.160
Grandpa, you look so young.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.080
Yes.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.640
Grandpa,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.880
let's hurry to take a selfie.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.040
I will apply the maximal retouching.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.840
I promise you will look like
a little fresh meat in the photo.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.760
What is a little fresh meat?

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.760
Grandpa,

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:12.680
a man as young and handsome as you
is called a little fresh meat.

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.960
Yes. Let's take a photo.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.280
Wei,

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.880
your classmate is so amusing.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.160
Come on! Give it to me.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:19.760
Come on!

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.840
Get closer!

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.520
I have sent the picture to your father.

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.640
Well,

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.280
Mrs. Zhao, why hasn't Mr. Zhao come?

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.720
I hid it from him on purpose.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.480
He is not qualified to come.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.480
Why are you so serious?

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.280
Be happy!

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:35.720
Good one.

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.880
You'd better hug her.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.680
Come on. Hug her. Stay closer.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.960
Get closer.

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.440
Good!

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.560
One more photo.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.560
I will take another photo.

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.600
Don't be angry.

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.240
Good! Get closer.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.040
Zhou Xiao!

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.720
Dad!

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.720
Mom!

00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.360
Why are you here?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.320
Come, follow me.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.520
Hurry to go out.
Your dad is really angry this time.

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.000
Get moving.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:17.320
Chop-chop.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.800
Excuse us.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:23.880
Fanzhou,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.880
they don't seem to like you.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:49.720
Dad,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:52.520
I...

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.400
Zhao Fanzhou...

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.600
I don't give my consent

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.440
to your love relationship with Zhao Fanzhou.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.840
Let her speak her mind first.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.440
Maybe

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.600
she has her own reasons.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.400
What reasons?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.720
She has been bed-ridden at home for the whole
winter holiday due to heartbreak.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880
Who has ever given me some reasons?

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.080
Don't say such things.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.640
It will make her so sad.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.640
Sad?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.480
My daughter is always full of vitality.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.400
But she has remained bed-ridden at home

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.680
for one month, crying in secret.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.600
That has made me so sad.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.960
I dare not scold her.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.800
I dare not ask her about the reasons.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.280
I felt as if a knife was piercing my heart.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:50.160
Do you know how sad I was?

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.920
Dad,

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.280
I am sorry!

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.360
I am sorry!

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.960
Say nothing more.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.680
I have only one requirement for you.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.200
I want you to break up with him.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:08.600
Dad.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.080
Don't act in such a manner.

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.720
Talk about it in a proper way.

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:25.640
Just listen to her explanation.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.960
Hello!

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.160
Mrs. Zhao.

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:32.400
OK.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:33.640
I got it.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:37.640
Dad.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.480
Mom.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.640
Zhao Fanzhou's mom

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.240
would like to have a talk with you.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:46.360
OK. OK.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.520
Dear

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.040
graduates of 2020,

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:53.440
hello!

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:58.960
You are on the point
of completing your studies

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.360
in Nanfang University

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.400
and will embark on

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.720
a new journey.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.600
I feel very honored to stand here.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.840
Today,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.080
on behalf of our university,

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.920
I give our best wishes

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.760
to all of you.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:15.240
I hope you'll have a bright future...

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.240
Are you ready?

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.480
... and make more achievements
in the coming days.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.560
Yes, I am.

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:23.000
During your past few years in NFU...

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:23.560
Are you sure?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.680
There is no chance of an error, you know?

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.400
Of course.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.040
... you've won honor and distinction
for the university.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.600
Where has Fanzhou gone?

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.680
I am very honored that you...

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.440
Where is Zhao Fanzhou?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.440
It is a very important moment of my life.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.360
He must be present.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:35.640
... the most outstanding graduates
in NFU history.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.000
I don't know.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.920
Especially there's a student among you
who has been elected by the national team

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.840
and will attend...

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.400
Stop looking for him.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400
... the World Junior Team Badminton
Championships.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:49.520
He is Xie Yixing from the Department
of Physical Education.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
He will go abroad

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.760
-and win honor for our country.
-You are being mentioned.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.320
You feel hot?

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:24.960
Yes.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:27.720
Since it's hot,

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.680
you'd better take a rest
before going on crying.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.720
How could you talk like
an unconcerned person?

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.000
Are you human?

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.200
You are venting your anger on me.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.720
I am venting my anger on you?

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.840
If I am, what's wrong with that?

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.240
Are you thinking that
this doesn't concern you?

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.520
Then I am telling you
that you caused all this.

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:47.840
It is you! You are the wrongdoer.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.800
For the next,

00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.680
I'd like to invite

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.640
the representative
of the outstanding graduates,

00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.720
Xie Yixing,

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.120
to come onto the stage to give us a speech.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.840
Don't get nervous. I believe you can do it.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.120
That's not the reason for me to be nervous.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.120
I will give you a surprise in a while.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.120
Go get it!

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.640
Respectable teachers,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:28.920
family and friends,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:29.960
guests

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200
and schoolmates,

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.480
good morning!

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.200
If you hadn't dumped me suddenly,

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.240
I wouldn't be so sad, right?

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:36.640
No.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.720
I didn't know that when I was sad,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.360
my dad was sad for me, too.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.080
Don't you think you have been very bad?

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:44.000
Yes, I have been bad.

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:46.200
You said I vented my anger on you?

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.920
Did I vent my anger on you?

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:48.840
Yes, you did.

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.120
No, you didn't.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.400
You should say sorry to my dad,
shouldn't you?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.400
Yes, I should.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.760
I'll beat you to death!

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.200
It is you! You are the wrongdoer.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.120
This is the end

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.160
of my speech!

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.400
Thank you all!

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.600
Here

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:22.880
I am earnestly requesting you

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.200
to give me another ten minutes

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.680
and to witness

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:28.400
the most important moment of my life.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.200
What is he intending to do?

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.720
Xie Yixing.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:55.680
Hello!

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.080
One, two, three.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.080
Hello!

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:03.720
The microphone stopped working.

00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.320
Just do it without it.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:24.800
Bro,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.040
kneel on one knee.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.560
Zhu Lu.

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.160
Lu,

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.200
rise to your feet.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.480
Rise to your feet.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.600
Zhu Lu,

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.400
I want to tell you that

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.000
I am happy to be in love with you.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:44.760
I,

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.960
I have opened a gym.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.400
Congratulations to you!

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.120
No! No! No!

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.680
I, I didn't mean that.

I want to give you a future.

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.560
So I want to ask you

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.320

Lu, can you?

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.200
What is wrong
with the graduates of this year?

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:21.920

They caused trouble at the entrance ceremony.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.680
And now they are causing trouble
at the graduation ceremony.

the situation to us in details.

Right. Please give him another chance.

OK. OK.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.800
Yes.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.520
I need more time

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.480

Right. Right.

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.560
I must treat you to this meal.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:02.600
You don't need to.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.840
Let Zhou treat us to the meal. He has money.

Mengjun,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:20.720
I have to admit that

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.680
what you did just now
was really a good strategy.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.680
My husband Zhenguo

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.240
has been convinced right away.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.520
What strategy?

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.840
It is a strategy frequently used by you

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.880
to deal with your father.

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:30.480
It is weaponizing tears.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:30.880
Right.

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:33.000
As a matter of fact,
while I was talking at that time,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.120
I was really very sad.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.520
Sorry to have let you see that.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.680
You don't need to say sorry.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.560
It is normal for a person to cry.

00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.160
Yes.

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.680
Crying can do us good.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:42.520
Hmm.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.160
Stop laughing.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:45.880
Listen to me.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.960
After you graduate,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.320
you should come back to stay with us
for a period of time

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.320
to please your dad.

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.320
He is still angry.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.600
Right. Right. Cotton up to him.

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.520
OK. No problem.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.600
Zhenguo.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:00.880
Come here.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.480
Come here. Come here.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:03.640
Come here.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:04.720
I want to talk with you about something.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.400
Mr. Zhou,

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.160
I have talked it over with Lijuan.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.360
Since you have come here,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.560
could you stay for a few more days?

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.840
We are planning to buy the matrimonial home
for our children.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:13.840
If you are here,

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.560
we can go see the houses
and exchange opinions.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.800
I know nothing about house.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.000
OK! OK! OK!

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:20.800
Good!

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.160
How is it?

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.560
Eh, well,

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.480
what you said is quite right.

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.200
It is very difficult for people

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:27.080
to buy ideal houses nowadays.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.200
The real estate developers are too shrewd.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.640
My husband knows how to buy a house.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.960
That's wonderful!

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.720
To be honest with you,

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.640
we have set aside

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.480
a sum of money for Zhou Xiao.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.120
Thus,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.240
we can pay for the house together with you.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.000
We shall buy a big one
so that they need not buy another later.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.120
OK. OK!

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.760
Shall we...

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.880
What matrimonial home? So funny!

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.280
Then,

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.760
shall we go to see the houses tomorrow?

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.920
OK. Good idea!

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.920
Let's go to see the houses tomorrow.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:52.440
Do you know what they are talking about?

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:54.600
No, I don't.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.680
You don't know?

00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:59.640
If you are so eager to know,
you can go ask them.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.640
Hurry up!

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:10.240
Don't walk so slowly.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.720
OK, Mr. Zhou!

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.160
Hey, it's me.

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.840
Stop calling me,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.640
or my phone will be out of juice again.

00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:00.240
The time for the Student Union
to pick you up was an hour ago.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.920
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.560
How about I treat you to a drink?

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.120
There is no need. Let's go.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.800
Wait a second.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.280
But I am hungry.

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.840
I haven't eaten anything since I left home.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.720
Could you please wait for me
to buy any food before we go?

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.200
Stop calling.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:22.800
Hurry to go.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.080
Lu is urging me a lot.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.120
Recently, she has been planning

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:27.480
the Post-Life Age Exhibition.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.080
If I was late,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.000
she would kill me

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.720
and have my body stuffed
to put it on display.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.200
What strange things

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.760
does Zhou Xiao have on her mind?

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:39.960
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:44.320
what are you thinking about?

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.120
Shake a leg!

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:46.760
We are almost late.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:48.840
Sometimes, her imagination is so wild

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:50.920
that I don't know
what comments I should make.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.880
Don't come near.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:53.920
Since you joined the Detective Club,

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.080
you have felt weird to me.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:56.760
Are you...

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.280
Am I what?

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.280
Are you plotting to overthrow me

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.120
and become the Detective Club's president?

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.400
I'm telling you,

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.080
that's not going to happen!

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120
The silly things she did...

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:08.960
Masterpieces of world literature?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.200
Stop watching it.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800
I didn't see the first part clearly.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.480
Wait a moment.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:13.960
Wait!

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.560
My hair gets tangled with the umbrella rib.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.880
The silly things she did often
made me feel hopeless.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.480
Let's go.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:31.360
But sometimes she is really funny.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.280
Let me go.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.920
She is so interesting.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.000
I can't help following her.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.000
When I came round,

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.760
she had dragged me

00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:04.360
out of my quiet

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.680
and cold world.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:06.280
Come on in.

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:07.560
Hmm.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:08.200
It's cold outside.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.080
It seems you can be happy
no matter what happens.

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.160
I began to feel things from her perspective.

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.520
I found that no matter
how serious the matter was,

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.960
she could handle it in a wonderful way.

00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:34.160
It starts now.

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.760
Does it look like fireworks?

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.520
Look at the glorious fireworks
I set off for you.

00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.440
Take it.

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.400
Point it at me.

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:47.640
Press it.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.160
Have a try.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.040
Press it again.

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.040
Alright.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.360
However,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.280
I am boring and dismal.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.760
(Bipolar Disorder: Genetic Risk 41.1)

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:20.360
I am not

00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:21.040
qualified

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:23.400
to have her.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.160
We need to break up.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.200
I thought I would return

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.000
to my quiet and cold world at worst.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.560
But I didn't expect that

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.800
without her,

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.520
I would be like an island.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.560
From all directions,

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.240
the biting sea wind poured in while moaning.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.080
It turned out that my world

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.080
could be emptier

00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.880
and colder.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.240
(Voice Memo
Sweet Voice Print)

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.640
You are holding my hand too tight.

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.040
Listen to me.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.360
When other students went home
after graduation,

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.480
their parents were unwilling
to let them leave again.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.520
However, I have been home
for less than half a month

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.320
before my dad urged me to leave

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.680
and to come back for job hunting.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:32.640
He said that

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.920
based on my capability, I would be starved
working as a full-time writer.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.200
Am I so bad at writing?

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.160
I am going to have my second book published.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.120
Sir,

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.360
hurry up a bit, please.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.640
The gym of a friend of ours
is about to open today.

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.840
We will miss the auspicious timing
if we don't hurry.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.480
OK.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:52.320
Luckily,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.680
she is willing

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.600
to bring me back to the noisy
human world again.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:48:59.520
It is a great honor

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.680
to have so many family members
and friends here today

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.440
to witness

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.080
the most important day of my life.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.560
Today is the first day
for Xinglu Gym to open business duly.

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.440
Starry, starry sky!

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:12.560
I will be with you all the way.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.640
I hope everybody

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:16.640
can enjoy workout.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.880
As the boss, I declare formally that

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.840
anyone obtains a membership card today

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.920
can get a discount of 30%.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:22.520
Isn't it wonderful?

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.920
Bravo!

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:25.800
Come on, cut the ribbon!

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:30.720
Come on!

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:31.920
Three!

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.000
