<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

3
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.380
Don't you think it's cowardly?

4
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.750
Why are you making Ji Soo stand on the ledge, while you're just watching her from behind?

5
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.420
Are you going to pick her up and run only after she falls?

6
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.500
Why aren't you thinking of how she's alone in such a scary place?

7
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.740
Ji Soo is suffering so much that I can't even stand to watch her from afar.

8
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.340
I...

9
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.500
There's nothing I can do.

10
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.180
If there was, I would do whatever that be.

11
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.860
But there's nothing I can do.

12
00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.060
Please stay next to Ji Soo. Don't make her stand there alone.

13
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.580
Whether it snows, rains, or blows heavy winds,

14
00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.810
if the two of you endure together

15
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.200
then I too...

16
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.640
I think I can live, too.

17
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.050
<i>Now I'm also going to do what will cause you the most pain.</i>

18
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.770
<i>Something that you can never do, even if you were to pour </i>

19
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.470
<i>all your power, money and time. </i>

20
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.190
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

21
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.520
Where did you say that woman went?

22
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.370
The hotel where the Vice President is.

23
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.890
What about Jae Hyeon? Where is Jae Hyeon?

24
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.030
You're crazy too.

25
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.310
Seo Kyeong.

26
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.070
What's wrong?

27
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.050
What's wrong?

28
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.860
Where did you hide her?

29
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.720
What are you talking about?

30
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.310
I'd rather wish you disappear.

31
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.270
I've really hit rock bottom.

32
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.740
You seemed to be aloof, but you've just caught me in tricks. You're no different from me.

33
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.620
That's the only way you'll get hurt.

34
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.670
Why are you doing nothing, after coming all the way here?

35
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:57.070
I told you why I came here.

36
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.890
I'm not someone that only receives.

37
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:03.320
I'll return it all to you multiplied by many. Will you be able to handle it?

38
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.300
If it's something I'll be the only one receiving, I don't care what it is.

39
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.490
It's something I brought upon myself. I need to take responsibility for it.

40
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.280
However, if you harm others around me, I won't hold back.

41
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.220
And if you don't hold back?

42
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:25.750
I'm going to fight with all my might. In the upright and fair ways.

43
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.110
Is being here right now upright?

44
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.040
I'm not going to do anything that you may be imagining right now.

45
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.820
That's my way.

46
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:54.410
This is my way. Breaking everything.

47
00:08:55.270 --> 00:09:00.370
If you break things like this and hurt others,

48
00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.000
do you feel comfortable and relieved?

49
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.010
I tried that, but I don't find that it does.

50
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.020
It actually makes me hurt more and feel distressed.

51
00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:31.290
Can you handle a woman that has such a strong sense of justice?

52
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.540
There are things that you've done.

53
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:10.740
<i>Se Hwi</i>

54
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.920
I have no strength right now.

55
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.380
Come and drive for me.

56
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.680
I wanted to hurt Jang Seo Kyeong

57
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.700
because too many people have been hurt by her.

58
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.640
You should've splashed her with water while you were at it. Or grabbed her hair.

59
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.940
The two of them suit each other. It's annoying.

60
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:10.800
That's why you were angered.

61
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.810
Why did you leave first? What if the two of them do something.

62
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.770
There's no way they would.

63
00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.270
Adults can't be wandering around like this. You only do that in your 20's.

64
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:42.790
You'll develop a deep-rooted sickness. Aren't you cold?

65
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:44.760
It's a bit cold.

66
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.080
Do you think you can walk all the way home like that time?

67
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.990
I don't think I can do that.

68
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.320
There's a rock in my heart.

69
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.350
I'm wondering if there's any method other than these shows I put on to aggravate her.

70
00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:21.150
When I heard that Seon Hee, who isn't involved in this at all, got dismissed,

71
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.980
something in my head just snapped

72
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.400
and I lost my rationality for a moment.

73
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.700
Please forget the me from today.

74
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.170
I don't know if that'll work out.

75
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.980
You were right.

<i>But I didn't do only that.</i>

88
00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:02.730
<i>I actually made your father to be prosecuted.</i>

89
00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.900
<i>The prosecutor who was investigating your father's complaint file against Hyeong Seong</i>

90
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.590
<i>was suddenly appointed to a post in the countryside, causing the primary prosecutor to be reassigned. </i>

91
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.990
<i>After that happened, your father was indicted. </i>

92
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:16.640
<i>I heard that happens when the primary prosecutor is insubordinate to a superior. </i>

93
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.750
I want to find someone.

94
00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.120
<i>Yes, who should I find?</i>

95
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.950
The person who first took on my father's case before being replaced.

96
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:36.760
Yeong Min, what are you doing?

97
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.430
Yes?

98
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.390
Mom.

99
00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.450
How dare you come here?

100
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:47.120
Stay here.

101
00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:54.550
Yeong Min, let's go. I know you don't want to see me,

102
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.980
but let's go home and talk about it.

103
00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:00.400
Mom, did you call me?

104
00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.540
I messaged you. Didn't you get it?

105
00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.720
What are you doing?

106
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.500
It seems like you intercepted my messages, but whether you file for a return of custody or not, I have it right now.

107
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:16.080
Your rights to visitation are once every two weeks, and cannot surpass two days and one night.

108
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.550
Yeong Min, gather your things and come out.

109
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.100
You're known across the whole nation as a woman with an affair,

110
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.900
and yet you shamelessly want to keep raising my baby?

111
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.130
I have both custody and parental rights.

112
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:38.110
Yeong Min has been here for over four days which is clearly illegal.

113
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.720
- This little— 
 - Mother.

114
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.930
If you even touch a hair on my body, I will file for assault as well.

115
00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:48.890
Please don't touch me in front of my son ever again.

116
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.010
Yeong Min, let's go.

117
00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.270
Until when do I have to put up with this?

118
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.610
Yeong Min.

119
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.640
Do you really not want to live with me?

120
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.580
If you really want that, I can let you go. But if you're doing it for me,

121
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.240
then I can't let you go.

122
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.220
I know the reason you didn't say anything about what was happening at the school was because of me, too.

123
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.910
Why do you have so many worries in that small head of yours?

124
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.530
If only I could, I want to find all of them and erase them for you.

125
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.700
I'll think about it. There's something I've told dad.

126
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.170
It's hard for me to make a decision right now.

127
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.800
Shall I push you? I'm good at pushing the swings.

128
00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:03.700
You used to make a whole loop around when I pushed you on the swings.

129
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.280
Why do you keep telling more fibs?

130
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.200
To make you smile.

131
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.390
They're just continuing to purchase more shares.

132
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:25.400
That's why we're at 36.8%, while Vice President Han is at 38.85%.

133
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.870
Once we proceed with the recapitalization by stock issuance to third party, our shares will increase to 56.8%.

134
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.540
What did you find out about the court?

135
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:35.800
Even if they file a lawsuit claiming the recapitalization was unjust,

136
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.130
if we just follow your orders there will be no issues according to the law.

137
00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:41.630
The prosecutor's office has already confirmed it.

138
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:46.740
It's unacceptable if the purpose of the recapitalization is to protect my management rights,

139
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.600
but if it's for improvement of the financial structure, it's all right.

140
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.200
Isn't that funny?

141
00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.160
You're the chairman indeed. How did you think of that?

142
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.000
Section Chief Lee, how long do you think the prosecutor's investigation will take?

143
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.830
Vice-President Han shouldered the borrowed-name shares, and  as family you are exempted from accountability over share dividends.

144
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.310
- I don't think you have much to worry about but..
 - But what?

145
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.570
I'm bothered by the fact that the prosecutor in charge is Kang Seung Woo. He's quite malicious.

146
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.330
I've been looking into him, here and there.

147
00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.250
But what did Seo Kyeong do that things have been so noisy?

148
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:26.140
She dismissed an employee in the distribution plant suddenly, and without a reason.

149
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.380
<i>Labor Relations Committee</i>

150
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.840
I could've just come alone.

151
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.400
How could I just watch when this happened because of me?

152
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.910
It's not just because of you. I knew something was coming for me sooner or later.

153
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.200
Why? Who else works as hard as you?

154
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.900
What would someone who worked as a cashier know about a distribution plant?

155
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:52.930
They needed to reinstate me, but they didn't like me no matter what.

156
00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.240
So they just gave me any weird position.

157
00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.260
They probably thought I would quit earlier than this. I bet you they didn't know I'm tougher than a whale's tendon.

158
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.500
They say relief orders are given easily for situations like this, so don't worry too much.

159
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.510
I shouldn't worry.

160
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.090
So I can eat and sleep well.

161
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.310
- Yes, Hye Jeong? 
 - <i>Where are you?</i>

162
00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.920
I'm on my way home.

163
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:34.270
<i>Stop by. Dong Jin got his incentive today, so he's treating us.</i>

164
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.560
<i>I know you're not in the mood to celebrate, but I'm not saying to eat and drink till we die today.</i>

165
00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.840
<i>I want to help brighten your mood because I thought you'd be feeling frustrated.</i>

166
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.610
Are you sure you don't just want to eat something?

167
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.500
<i>Is it obvious?</i>

168
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.360
I brought this thinking of you! I heard you go crazy over these.

169
00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.240
This punk... Are you challenging me again?

170
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.120
Do you want me to create a traumatic memory with chocolate cakes for you, too?

171
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.080
I don't like those either. I haven't had even one after that day.

172
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.420
Die! Die, chocolate cake!

173
00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.520
<i>July 1994</i>

174
00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.990
I feel like I'm going to die.

175
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.130
What weeds? There are bamboo shoots.

176
00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.660
If it's this bad, don't you think we should pick the barley out and grow the weeds?

177
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.840
You were slacking off the whole time.

178
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.050
Forget it.

179
00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:30.600
Hey, can you take off my boots for me?

180
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.160
- I don't want to. 
 - Come on!

181
00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.690
Goodness, my blood sugar is dropping.

182
00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.200
Let's eat.

183
00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.270
Can we eat this?

184
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:53.340
Why not? Didn't they buy it for us to eat?

185
00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:05.210
I was going to die because of low blood sugar, but now I feel alive.

186
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.590
Eat it, punk. Eat.

187
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.720
What are you guys doing?

188
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.310
What are you eating?

189
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.000
Chocolate Cake.

190
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.080
Why are you eating that?

191
00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.280
Because I want to.

192
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:26.740
Are you the only ones that want to eat?

193
00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:31.200
It's not just chocolate cake. Don't you know that the elders gave it to us to share?

194
00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.740
Then you can eat one too! Why are you making a fuss about what I eat?

195
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.060
How is this rural volunteering if you're just eating whatever you want? That's just an MT!

196
00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:45.170
♫ Biting their fingers  ♫

197
00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:50.730
♫ the brothers take an oath, ♫

198
00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:56.210
♫ crying out for the truth. ♫

199
00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.900
We'll stop our assessments here for today.

200
00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:07.760
Lastly, regarding what happened this afternoon.

201
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.520
What? Me?

202
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.790
Hey. Cut it out.

203
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:17.630
Who speaks informally during a meeting?

204
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:20.700
I'm telling you to cut it out...

205
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.250
please. (using formal speech) Is eating one piece of cake because I was hungry something to make this much of a fuss about?

206
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:30.010
If there are no rules or regulations, rural volunteer work will become a mess in just an instant.

207
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.880
Do you think we wrote that as decoration?

208
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.040
You snack whenever you want, sleep whenever you want,

209
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.370
and wash up whenever you want? Did we come here to play?

210
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.790
I'm sorry. This won't happen again.

211
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:49.540
I mean, it's not like we ate every day. It was just once... (changes to formal speech at the very end)

212
00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:53.760
I'm telling you I only ate one. Ma'am.

213
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.150
We found three empty packages.

214
00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:01.610
I mean... I was just so tired toda—

215
00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.850
Who here wasn't tired?

216
00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:08.610
Today's project was so difficult that even the elderly find it challenging.

217
00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:12.620
On top of that, the presidents only got three hours of sleep yesterday because they were in a meeting.

218
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.920
Mr. Lee Dong Jin. How many times did you straighten out your back when we were pulling the weeds?

219
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.850
Just a fair amount. Why?

220
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:22.040
Do you know how many times the elders next to you straightened their backs?

221
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.570
Wouldn't it be weirder if I knew the answer to that question?

222
00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.160
And you? Were you watching that instead of working?

223
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.180
They don't straighten out their backs even once.

224
00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.760
The students are only here for show. They're more of a nuisance.

225
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.560
They were just here to laugh, eat, and drink. If we're going to hear things like this,

226
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.320
it's best you pack up your belongings and head back immediately.

227
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.420
If you eat like that whenever you want,

228
00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.860
there will be people who can't eat. It'll make us cry.

229
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.530
So what? What do you want me to do about it?

230
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:53.660
The two of you will cook breakfast and dinner tomorrow.

231
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.450
You will also have one additional round of picking weeds.

232
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:58.350
- Hey. (informally) 
 - Hey?

233
00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.250
In this heat of summer, you expect me to—

234
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:14.250
Look, Mr. Han. Can I just throw it up?

235
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.840
Okay. If you throw it up exactly as it was found I'll acknowledge it, Mr. Lee Dong Jin.

236
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.630
- I'm going to leave. I'm leaving. 
  - You're leaving?

237
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:48.020
When are we going to finish all of these, huh?

238
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:50.120
Stop complaining.

239
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.210
Do you think this is complaining?

240
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:56.340
They shamed me so much for eating just one chocolate pie.

241
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.480
Ji Soo! What's wrong? Why is she like this?

242
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.660
She fainted. I'll be right back.

243
00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:16.990
Let me down! Let me down!

244
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.020
- Please let me down. 
 - I'm not tired. Just stay still.

245
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.430
No, let me down.

246
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:27.740
- Why are you being like this? 
 - That's what I should be saying to you.

247
00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.570
- You fainted. 
 - I didn't faint.

248
00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.910
Let's just say you did and go rest in the village hall.

249
00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.750
Why? We can't do that. How can I be the only one that rests?

250
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.220
You're not okay right now.

251
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.840
They all want to rest. How can I rest alone?

252
00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:50.360
We're not at an MT! Is resting when we want and sleeping when we want rural volunteering?

253
00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.570
I'm going back.

254
00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.420
Ji Soo. Ji Soo, you're sick.

255
00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.620
Hurry up and work.

256
00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.610
They say a novice shaman kills a man. 
 <i>(T/N: Recklessly taking action when one doesn't have the skills to solve an issue can cause trouble)</i>

257
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.790
After that, Ji Soo would come over every time anyone relaxed and say,

258
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.270
"How is this rural volunteering? How is this volunteering?" Her nagging was just—

259
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.940
That's what I'm saying! After she got back from that, she always talked about it.

260
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:20.480
I thought she had gone to the navy or something.

261
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.130
I thought it was kind of unfair. I didn't get to even properly eat it.

262
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.530
<i>That's right. Yeong Woo spit it out right after he took a bite.</i>

263
00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:34.490
<i>You dumb punk. I told you to eat it quick and discreetly.</i>

264
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.610
What's rural volunteering?

265
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.680
I think they're talking about volunteering in helping out rural communities with their farm work.

266
00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.770
Have you been to that?

267
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.120
No. That wasn't in my major.

268
00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:00.230
Is it like camping? Camping isn't much fun either.

269
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.750
Let's stop it now.

270
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.960
What are you talking about?

271
00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:12.410
Wire-tapping and taking secret footage. I want to stop it.

272
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.060
I'm sick of it.

273
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.420
Long time no see. It seems we're the same.

274
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:38.270
If you're not trying to be friends with me, just get to the point.

275
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:43.590
I want to check something. I heard you were in the middle of a divorce suit.

276
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.910
So?

277
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.080
Do you really want to get a divorce?

278
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.700
Why do I have to tell you that?

279
00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:56.970
Let's say it's out of respect for someone you cooperated with before.

280
00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:02.150
Do you still have lingering feelings for Han Jae Hyeon?

281
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.000
What about you?

282
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.940
Have you not given up Yoon Ji Soo? What about custody?

283
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.710
I'm no longer interested in things like custody or remarriage.

284
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:20.180
The only thing I want is for Han Jae Hyeon and Yoon Ji Soo,

285
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:23.670
for these two people, I wish misfortune.

286
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.140
Hyung.

287
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.490
Yeong Woo.

288
00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:41.400
Thanks for calling me.

289
00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.840
She seems like she's still having a hard time.

290
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.850
Thanks for telling me not to leave Ji Soo alone, too.

291
00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.920
If you're grateful, then come often. Business isn't that great these days.

292
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.460
Okay, okay. But I'm not strong with alcohol.

293
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.710
You have Ji Soo.  She's 100 for your 1.

294
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.980
But are you okay?

295
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:14.140
Of course, I am. Not okay.

296
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:20.930
But still. It's something I chose, so I have to take responsibility for it.

297
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.800
Well, I don't think it's all over yet.

298
00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:32.420
- Really? 
 - Who knows when you'll slip up?

299
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:36.640
Maybe Ji Soo's pea pod will fall off her eyes one day. ('pea pod' used in Korean as an expression for 'blind for love')

300
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:51.300
Why did you come to pick me up?

301
00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:54.070
Because it's raining, and I felt like my energy wasn't so great. <i>(T/N: Quoting a 1994 song from Lim Jong Hwan, "I just walked.") </i>

302
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.390
Such an old person.

303
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.400
Seeing how you know that song, you're such an old person as well.

304
00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.010
Talking about the old days made me miss you, so it's good.

305
00:31:05.010 --> 00:31:08.190
No wonder my ears were burning.

306
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:14.810
The patting sound of the rain is comforting.

307
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:20.490
Still, you shouldn't get wet. Stick close.

308
00:31:20.490 --> 00:31:23.510
Your shoulder is getting drenched too, come in closer.

309
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.370
It'll get drenched anyway since I'm a shoulder gangster <i>(a colloquialism for broad shoulders).</i>

310
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.170
You covering me with the umbrella feels really cozy.

311
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.890
Well, the ceiling is indeed high.

312
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:47.570
♫ <i>If we can reach that day, that time</i> ♫

313
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.620
It'll be tiresome for me if you catch a cold, that's why.

314
00:31:53.570 --> 00:32:01.040
♫ <i>Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed</i> ♫

315
00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.360
♫ <i>You are no longer a memory, but my every day</i> ♫

316
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.970
We received an order from the Labor Relations Committee yesterday to provide relief regarding the wrongful dismissal.

317
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.190
It's about Choi Seon Hee's dismissal case.

318
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:12.500
And so, what do they want us to do?

319
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.210
If we do not follow the order, a penalty will be imposed to compel execution of the relief.

320
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:18.820
Otherwise, we can also apply for a retrial.

321
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.630
But the reason for dismissal is too big a disadvantage to us.

322
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.150
We can just give them money.

323
00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.460
There might be opposition from the labor union or the stockholders.

324
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.070
I don't care.

325
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:33.640
The CEO says she has no intention whatsoever to reinstate  Choi Seon Hee.

326
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.000
That should raise some issues, though.

327
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.790
We received an order of relief from the Labor Relations Committee, but she said she would rather pay the penalty.

328
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.980
<i>Revealing the brutality of murderous corporation Hyeong Seong</i>

329
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.280
Elder.

330
00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:18.440
I was unaware you had started protesting again. I am ashamed to appear in front of you.

331
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:23.460
In my whole life, I have never done anything for my wife.

332
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.330
And I couldn't even keep my last promise to her.

333
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:31.230
Are you talking about the promise to relieve your late son's resentment?

334
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.700
I was pondering on what I should do for the time I have left to live.

335
00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.040
But this was the only thing I could do.

336
00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:49.370
After the lawsuit, Han Jae Hyeon didn't even give a word of apology, did he?

337
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:57.980
He had the time for an extramarital affair, but not for an apology, apparently.

338
00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.290
- An affair? 
 - Yes.

339
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:06.610
And still, it looks like he is coveting the wealth of his wife's family.

340
00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:10.440
There is a rumor that Hyeong Seong will soon become his company.

341
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.910
Even when your son's unfair passing is all that man's doing.

342
00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:19.570
While I was investigating the matter for the lawsuit, I found that there were several such instances.

343
00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:21.700
There is no end to his greed.

344
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:25.330
In order to accomplish his desire for money, he wouldn't distinguish water from fire (would push ahead regardless of circumstances).

345
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.350
I feel the heavens are showing much indifference.

346
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.380
He will be punished.

347
00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.760
Sorry?

348
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.940
- Yes, Unni? 
 - <i>Yeong Min's mom, what should we do? </i>

349
00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.730
<i>They say that Seon Hee collapsed.</i>

350
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.920
- Brain surgery? 
 - Yes.

351
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:10.200
Well, they said it's not a big operation

352
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.420
and that it went well.

353
00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:14.160
Then why all of a sudden...

354
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:19.160
It wasn't really all of a sudden. She also collapsed once before while working at the company.

355
00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.970
How could she be fit to work at the distribution center when she used to be a cashier?

356
00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:26.650
She was being slow and kept getting remarks about it.

357
00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:30.850
So she pushed herself and worked until late into the night, and that's how this happened.

358
00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:38.610
She has to get the medical certificate, apply for industrial accident, and also protest against her wrongful dismissal.

359
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.370
Maybe it's because of the tense atmosphere, but no one is willing to take action.

360
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:49.970
The labor union seems to be reluctant as well. These days, you really have nowhere to go after being fired.

361
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:51.500
What family does she have?

362
00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.800
Her elderly mother and a son in middle school. There isn't anyone who can earn money.

363
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.360
Seon Hee.

364
00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.920
Come on in.

365
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.260
Why are you sitting up? You should be lying down.

366
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:32.520
It's just that I was a bit scared

367
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.160
that I'd stay lying down forever.

368
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.390
How can you say such a thing?

369
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:48.390
I enjoyed drinking with you.

370
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:52.190
I'll make it even more enjoyable. So get better soon.

371
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.960
Will I be able to do that?

372
00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:58.960
When I'm like this?

373
00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.610
There is nothing wrong with you. You should get better very soon.

374
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:06.300
You also made a promise with me that you wouldn't lose easily.

375
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.130
I wish I could at least lose.

376
00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:18.610
Because I feel like I might not even have another chance to fight.

377
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:26.540
Issuing stocks only to your side in order to protect your management rights

378
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:29.930
is not allowed by the Korean court of law.

379
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:34.350
Then shouldn't we file a lawsuit as well?

380
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:38.650
There are some cases where capital increase by allotment of stockes to third parties is allowed.

381
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.200
Improvement of financial structure.

382
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.470
Chairman Jang will say he made such decision for the sake of improving the financial structure.

383
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.430
Then what do we have to do?

384
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:52.360
We should file a lawsuit for now, even if it doesn't lead to the ruling we want.

385
00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:53.900
And regardless of the result,

386
00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.000
we should spread the rumor of a competition for shares over the company's management rights.

387
00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.210
Why is that?

388
00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.010
Be it through the lawsuit or the rumor, the dispute over management rights must become a trending topic.

389
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.460
If the stock value goes up due to the rumor, the shares will have to keep increasing.

390
00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.590
But even at the current price, buying any more stocks is difficult.

391
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:12.890
So how do you expect to handle things if the rate gets even higher?

392
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.590
We won't need to buy a lot of them.

393
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:18.420
We just have to make it look as if we are constantly buying more shares.

394
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.320
If they proceed with the issuance of stocks to third parties, they will have over fifty percent of the shares.

395
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.900
What would be the use of competing over shares in that situation?

396
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.240
This game will be one where losing at the beginning

397
00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.030
means winning later on.

398
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.310
Please excuse me.

399
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.260
<i>Let's meet up briefly, Sunbae.</i>

400
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.470
Let us end our meeting here today.

401
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:55.670
Ah right, I heard that the wrongful dismissal of an employee here is causing quite a stir.

402
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.670
It looked like they were demanding reinstatement and compensation for industrial accident as well.

403
00:38:58.670 --> 00:39:02.640
If you grant them one, it becomes two later,

404
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.790
and then ten of them.

405
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.420
Ji Soo.

406
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:38.360
In Unni Seon Hee's case, it's a clearly unfair dismissal.

407
00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.900
The hospital also confirmed the cause was due to overwork.

408
00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.470
I know, but it's not easy, Ji Soo,

409
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.650
since human resources are under the CEO's authority.

410
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:57.280
There have been multiple suggestions to chance the CEO, but Chairman Jang won't do a thing about it.

411
00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:02.570
And the investors on our side are sensitive to things like recognition of industrial accidents and union strife.

412
00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.490
Why?

413
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:09.520
They're people who want to ultimately own the company,

414
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.500
so they don't want to side with the employees.

415
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.740
Without those people, I cannot win

416
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.570
in the fight against Chairman Jang that I've been preparing for years.

417
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:25.180
Other than punishing Chairman Jang,

418
00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.940
is ownership of the company what you want as well?

419
00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:36.040
Why? That wasn't yours to begin with.

420
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.860
It's both revenge and a reward.

421
00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.170
Is it difficult to understand?

422
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.560
So is it okay then, in order to reach your goal, to sacrifice a few powerless people?

423
00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.850
For the main character,

424
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:02.860
it can't be helped, but for the nameless soldiers in the frontline to fall?

425
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:13.690
Whether it be the general or officer, the main protagonist always relays commands while standing in the middle.

426
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:19.030
On the frontline, the nameless infantry take the bullets,

427
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:24.910
and even if they are lucky enough to survive from it, they fall at the enemy general's sword or gun without a sound.

428
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:32.410
But no one in there deserves to just be taken down by a gun or sword.

429
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:37.470
Before they fell like that, they were all the main protagonists in their own lives.

430
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.600
It wasn't Jang Seo Kyeon, Yeong Min's dad, or the children.

431
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.550
This was the biggest obstacle between us.

432
00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:58.790
I will still continue loving you, as always and forever,

433
00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:06.320
but I will do the things I believe are right,

434
00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:11.050
and I'm going to take the side of those with whom nobody else will side.

435
00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:19.150
Just like we were able to love again,

436
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:24.140
I hope you can return to those times again.

437
00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:07.740
<i>Maybe it's because of the tense atmosphere, but no one is willing to take action.</i>

438
00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:13.360
<i>I feel like I might not even have another chance to fight.</i>

439
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:20.090
<i>Without those people, I cannot win</i>

440

<i>in the fight against Chairman Jang that I've been preparing for years.</i>

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.700
<i>Petition</i>

442
00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.480
<i>Ms. Choi Seon Hee, a former colleague who used to work under a temporary position at the supermarket with us</i>

443
00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.870
<i>and was then an employee at Hyeong Seong Distribution's warehouse, without any justification from the company's owner...</i>

444
00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:55.210
It's really okay.

445
00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:57.390
I'm also really fine.

446
00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.410
The taste is so-so, but I have quick hands.

447
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.160
I already cooked breakfast for my son.

448
00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.130
I mean, still. Can I take all of these?

449
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:09.000
It's nothing compared to what Unni Seon Hee's done for me.

450
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.190
So please don't feel burdened by it at all.

451
00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.150
Son! You can be my son for the time being.

452

<i>Labor Legislation Office 
 Labor Attourney Kwan Tae Keun </i>

453
00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:02.520
Wait a minute.

454
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.140
What are you doing?

455
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.920
I thought you wouldn't come out even if I asked to meet.

456
00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.660
You said you wouldn't meet me regarding Choi Seon Hee.

457
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.160
It's a petition from everyone I used to work with.

458
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.530
You can keep it. It's a copy.

459
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.630
I'm going to court with the original copy.

460
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:31.420
So what are you telling me to do?

461
00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.730
I'm going to file a lawsuit for wrongful dismissal.

462
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:37.500
There was neither a good reason nor a 30-day notice.

463
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.330
If the wrongful dismissal is acknowledge by court, the payment of her wage for the duration of the dismissal will be enforceable.

464
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:47.500
The Labor Relations Commission can also press criminal charges for disobeying the order to provide relief measures.

465
00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:51.310
And also, I plan on going to the broadcast station.

466
00:45:51.310 --> 00:45:52.760
What did you say?

467
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.740
Thanks to you, I am widely known now, and I even have a story.

468
00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.050
The broadcast station will welcome me with open arms.

469
00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.620
Are you saying you, Jae Hyeon, and I can all just die together?

470
00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.450
I told you I would fight with everything I've got.

471
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:12.980
In the fair and upright ways.

472
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:17.770
I'll give you three days.

473
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.620
I'm sorry. I heard this from CEO Jang's driver,

474
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:42.120
but apparently Yoon Ji Soo went to her house this morning. 
 - What for?

475
00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:47.760
She said she'll start a lawsuit regarding Choi Seon Hee's situation and go to the broadcast station to expose her.

476
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.000
<i>The person you are trying to call...</i>

477
00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.240
I don't think she's home.

478
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.830
Would it be possible to find out which hospital Choi Seon Hee is staying at?

479
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:17.060
Yes, I'll look into it.

480
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.420
<i>Hyeong Seong </i>

481
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.720
Vice President. I found the prosecutor you were looking for last time.

482
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.590
Oh really? Where is he?

483
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.150
He's set up a law office in Incheon.

484
00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.900
All these materials the district attorney gave are true.

485
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.360
I understand.

486
00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.530
Let's see. Your father's case

487
00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:42.790
is one of the most painful memories I have of the time I worked in the prosecutor's office.

488
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:45.380
The materials that your father brought me

489
00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.870
were clear evidence of the wrongdoings of Hyeong Seong's management board.

490
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:51.950
So the start of the investigation went very smoothly,

491
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:56.650
but as the investigation continued, the number of phone calls I got,

492
00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:59.490
and the people asking for me, kept increasing.

493
00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:04.290
They were all from different places, but they all had the same request.

494
00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.480
Close the investigation in its early stages,

495
00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.580
and then erase the name of Hyeong Seong and Chairman Jang from this investigation.

496
00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.300
While I was a prosecutor,

497
00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:18.230
there was one thing I kept in my heart.

498
00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:24.020
"Even if justice cannot be protected, let's not compromise."

499
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:30.470
Well, that's why I'm living like this.

500
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:34.380
Anyway, I started doing internal investigations on the people

501
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.230
who were giving me orders and requesting that I do these things.

502
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.680
I was curious as to why these people

503
00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:43.590
were so protective of Chairman Jang.

504
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:45.770
But once I looked into things,

505
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:53.290
they were all tied together with Chairman Jang right in the middle. No matter how much I dug into it, there was no end to it.

506
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:58.650
These are the results of that internal investigation.

507
00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:03.980
As soon as I reported these findings to district attorney Yoon Hyeon Koo,

508
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:08.740
my time as a prosecutor came to an end.

509
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:22.580
It's a bit late, but you'll be able to uphold justice now as well.

510
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:40.010
<i>I will do the things I believe are right.</i>

511
00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:44.960
<i>and I'm going to take the side of those with whom nobody else will side.</i>

512
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.150
<i>Just like we were able to love again,</i>

513
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:53.410
<i>I hope you can return to those times.</i>

514
00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:07.460
Why, why, why is it here again? It makes me uneasy.

515
00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:11.520
But I don't see the chicken gizzard.

516
00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:13.080
Huh?

517
00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.760
What are you planning on telling me that you keep smiling like that? Is it something surprising?

518
00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.560
Okay. Let me take a Cheongsimhwan (Korean herbal pill to clear the mind).

519
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:26.370
I'm going to return.

520
00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:28.710
To where?

521
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:31.690
The place I was long ago.

522
00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.420
Eat up and then study, okay?

523
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:51.330
Aren't you tired? You've been cooking every day for them these days.

524
00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.670
Don't you think that when you were having difficult times at school, if someone helped you

525
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:59.160
or if someone had taken your side, it would've been less difficult and lonely?

526
00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.880
I'll be back.

527
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:11.180
<i>I have something to tell you. I hope you'll come to meet me.</i>

528
00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.110
<i>It's something important.</i>

529
00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:16.810
<i>Nine o'clock. At the snack cart where we met last time.</i>

530
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:22.740
Deliver this to Reporter Jeong Yoon and head home for the day.

531
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:23.980
Yes.

532
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.620
What should I tell him this is?

533
00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:30.150
He'll know if you say it's the second Pandora's Box.

534
00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.420
I will.

535
00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.870
Hello.

536
00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:41.790
Which flowers would you like?

537
00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:44.750
I was thinking roses.

538
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.060
<i>August 1994</i>

539
00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.320
You guys argue sometimes too?

540
00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.110
Why did you argue?

541
00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:02.150
It's been like this since we came back from the rural volunteering trip,

542
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:05.530
but he keeps treating me like a child, not letting me do anything difficult.

543
00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:08.950
He keeps looking after me, and it makes me feel bad toward others.

544
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:11.110
Goodness, I'm  so annoyed.

545
00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.300
I got a page!

546
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:22.860
<i>I'm in front of your house. I'll wait until you come out.</i>

547
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.980
You laughed after you cried.

548
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.920
What's all this?

549
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:39.700
They said that white and red roses together symbolize reconciliation.

550
00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.620
Who said that?

551
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.270
Dong Jin.

552
00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:50.710
It's too difficult to argue.

553
00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.560
For me too.

554
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:55.910
Let's not argue anymore.

555
00:54:55.910 --> 00:55:01.700
If we think we'll argue, let's raise our right hands.

556
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:06.170
If the other person raises their right hand, we should think "They must be upset at something."

557
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:09.340
"We could argue again, let's stop."

558
00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:12.130
Like this?

559
00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.390
If you have something else to tend to, you should go.

560
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:05.690
That's not it.

561
00:56:05.690 --> 00:56:08.910
I'm going to watch a drama.

562
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:11.090
It's bothersome if someone else is here.

563
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.740
I'm really okay.

564
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:17.090
Are you my husband or my child?

565
00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:21.050
Why are you here every day? It's really bothersome.

566
00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:24.970
You being like this is all because of me.

567
00:56:24.970 --> 00:56:28.330
Why is my sickness because of you?

568
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:30.800
Anyway, I'm really fine for today.

569
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.430
Really.

570
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.010

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:29.030
Oh no! Oh no!

Oh my goodness! Oh no!

577
