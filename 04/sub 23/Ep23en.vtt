<i> ♫ Close your eyes. I am so, so, so captivated by you like this ♫ </i>

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.180
<i> ♫ You fell into my colorful dream from last night ♫ </i>

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.380
<i>♫ I want to work hard to gain your attention ♫</i>

<i>♫ A dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

11

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.970
<i>♫ You are a blessing and a blight ♫</i>

<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.300
-Head constable Zheng.
-Yes?

35
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.830
I came to say goodbye.

36
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.830
What do you mean?

37
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.320
You aren't running Miaosheng Restaurant anymore?

38
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.760
Are you not pursuing Advisor Tan anymore?

39
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.410
You're renouncing the marriage contract?

40
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.870
It's not that I'm not pursuing anymore.

41
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.280
It's just that I see clearly now.

42
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.060
My marriage with Miss.

43
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.830
It was an arranged marriage.

44
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.910
The words of a matchmaker.

45
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.620
I still remember.

46
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.670
When I first saw her,

47
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.250
it was the morning of the fifth day of the first month.

48
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.090
She

49
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.420
secretly climbed the wall from the backyard into the Tan house.

50
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.280
Her father caught her red-handed!

51
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.340
With her smile,

52
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.540
the winter's first plum flowers blossomed.

53
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.760
The flower in my heart also bloomed.

54
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.200
Even now, I couldn't bear to pick it out.

55
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.670
-Brother Zhu.
-Yes?

56
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.840
I never thought

57
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.660
you would be someone who cherishes flowers.

58
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.340
So, no matter how much she rejects me

59
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.130
I'm always thinking

60
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.680
that if I can hold onto the flower in my heart,

61
00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.030
then she will be moved by actions.

62
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.960
But just like what you said, the only person I have moved

63
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.140
there's only me.

64
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.930
Before, I thought she came here to

65
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.180
avoid me.

66
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.980
Until today, I finally understood.

67
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.160
She actually liked staying here.


69
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.130
This is the marriage contract.

70
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.720
Please give this to Lord Tang.

71
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.600
From now on,

72
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.960
my marriage with Linyin

73
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.010
is finished.

74
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.600
Brother Zhu.

75
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.290
In the future,

76
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.050
we'll respectively marry other people and

77
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.390
will have nothing to do with each other.

78
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.230
When Lord Tang sees this

79
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.800
he will definitely

80
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.360
feel better again.

81
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.850
I'll give you a gift.

82
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.830
This is Miss Ruyi's contract.

83
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.800
You

84
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.340
never paid the 500 taels.

85
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.560
However,

86
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.510
I give you guys my blessings. Lovers will always have a happy ending.

87
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.450
You and Miss Ruyi must stay well.

88
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.380
Thank you.

89
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.680
But I'm afraid this contract...

90
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.760
There isn't any use.

91
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.170
Brother Zhu, you are a good person.

92
00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.600
I recognize you as my brother.

93
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.810
If you have any problems in the future,
you can always tell me.

94
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.370
Okay.

95
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.850
You

96
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.550
are going back to Jinan?

97
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.850
Yes.

98
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.460
I can't help with anything here.

99
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.580
I even caused trouble for fianc—

100
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.580
for her.

101
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.710
Brother Zhu.

102
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:11.400
Are you not going to say goodbye to Advisor Tan?

103
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.720
No.

104
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:24.400
Ever since Lord Tang got hurt,

105
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:28.250
she has been sad.

106
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.670
I am not going to stay here and trouble her anymore.

107
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.610
Brother Zhu.

108
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.340
You have liked her at some point.

109
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.200
If you sadly walk away like this,

110
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.610
the sincere effort you put in...

111
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.390
how is that good?

112
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.750
What you said is correct.

113
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.700
Brother Zheng.

114
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:15.530
Make sure to say hi when you come to Jinan.

115
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.160
We will

116
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.200
meet soon.

117
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.950
Miss.

118
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:00.920
Dacong?

119
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:02.600
Do you have time today?

120
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.850
I don't have time today. Can we talk another time?

121
00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.900
There's no another time. I am going back to Jinan today.

122
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:15.390
This sudden?

123
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.970
Can I treat you to a meal?

124
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.560
Let's go eat and chat.

125
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.060
Okay.

126
00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.200
Why did you bring me to this place to eat?

127
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.530
Because there's food you like to eat here.

128
00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:53.820
Miss, look. Does that kite look like the one
we played with when we were young?

129
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.650
It does.

130
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.990
Here's your pig liver.

131
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.780
Fiancee, our pig liver is ready.

132
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.890
Please enjoy.

133
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.590
I've tried to please you with expensive delicacies.

134
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:23.000
But you like to eat pig liver from these road-side stalls.

135
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.460
You thought it through?

136
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.130
I already gave Sir Tang the marriage contract.

137
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:43.300
When I get back to Jinan, I will explain it to our parents.

138
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.520
Miss, I actually tried.

139
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:57.200
If there's someone to blame, blame the heavens for letting us meet but not letting us love.

140
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.570
You're actually pretty good.

141
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:04.380
Although you're spoiled, you'll never hurt anyone.

142
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.500
Wait a minute! You should stop talking. I...I was finally able to...

143
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.040
I have already decided to leave but with your words you're pulling me back.

144
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.930
Also, I don't understand you.

145
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:21.410
Once you decide on someone, not even 8 horses can pull you back.

146
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.840
You're too good for that...let's not mention him!

147
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.960
Then eat more, I'll treat you.

148
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.600
Qingchen and I will play with the kite
with you when we go to Jinan.

149
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.400
Not another time, let's play with it today.

150
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.920
Now?

151
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:45.160
Yes.

152
00:11:54.700 --> 00:12:00.900
Does this one look good?
This one or this one? This one?

153
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.120
Okay, I'll take this one.

154
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.250
-Okay.
-Thank you.

155
00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.170
Run faster.

156
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.510
Miss, slow down.

157
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.710
This kite flew really high up.

158
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.260
It was all thanks to Miss who taught me when were young.

159
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.550
I was stupid then that I only learned how now.

160
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.190
Miss, look.

161
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.190
I'm not trying to be clingy.

162
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.140
This kite

163
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.410
is one of my memories.

164
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.920
Today.

165
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.570
Let the story of husband Zhu Dacong

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.950
and wife Tan Lingyin

167
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.000
blow away with the wind.

168
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.380
♫<i> Sitting there zoning out. I feel stuck. I just can't let go </i>♫

Linying.

173
00:13:54.300 --> 00:14:00.150
Is Sir going to marry you?

174
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.010
I am lucky to meet you.

175
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.520
I can see you everyday.

176
00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.490
But I am also unlucky

177
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.840
because I fell in love with you.

178
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:35.600
What's more unfortunate is that I was unable to have you.

179
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:45.600
Lingyin, Tongling is dangerous.

180
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.360
You must take care of yourself when I'm not here anymore.

181
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.670
Don't throw tantrums all the time.

182
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.870
You must stay well with Sir.

183
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.200
Can I call you Miss one last time?

184
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.560
Miss.

Assitant Zhou is back.

201
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:21.310
Where is the Lord and Xiao Liu? Who are these people?

202
00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:24.900
These are the new constables from the Chi State Office.

203
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.790
The Lord got hurt badly and Miss Jiang is scared there is a thef.

204
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.830
who will attack our county office. So they're here to protect us.

205
00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.960
Sir is in trouble?

206
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.490
He still isn't awake.

207
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:37.050
I'll go take a look.

208
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:47.050
Miss Jiang said the Lord needs rest, so he has to rest.

209
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.600
When he is better than she will tell us.

210
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.180
Don't be concerned about things you shouldn't be concerned about. Do the things you have to do.

211
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.840
These

212
00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:31.300
were all found in your room.

213
00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.780
What do you mean?

214
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:34.520
Where did you go yesterday?

215
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:35.500
You're suspecting me?

216
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.350
Where did you go!

217
00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.870
I went to see Zong Yinglin.

218
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:44.230
He is leaving Tongling.

219
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.070
Nothing more?

220
00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.660
Are you sure

221
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.700
it's not to kidnap Qingchen and kill Lord Tang?

222
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.650
Zheng Shaofeng!

223
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.390
He came to see me last night to take me.

224
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:05.280
He already quit! He didn't do any of these things.

225
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:13.040
Why are you looking at me like that?

226
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:22.180
The evidence is conclusive. I have to believe it.

227
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.390
Ruyi, I gave you a chance before.

228
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.830
I waited for you this long, but Tang Tianyuan.

229
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.320
Tang Tianyuan is my brother!

230
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:41.120
How can you do that to him?

231
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.690
If I said it wasn't me, would you believe me?

232
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.030
Explain these things clearly to me!

233
00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.940
If you believe all these were done by me,

234
00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.060
then you can tie me up.

235
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:10.240
Guards!

236
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.290
Take her away!

237
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.830
Please stop.

238
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.310
I have something to say to Sir.

239
00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:50.440
You can just tell me what you need to say.

240
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.240
You can't stop me.

241
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.380
I've already asked the emperor. Before Sir is completely healed,

242
00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.930
as his fiance,

243
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.330
I have the right to take care of everything at the County Office.

244
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:07.600
Head constable Zheng, are you here to report about the situation?

245
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.800
You can just tell me.

246
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.960
Miss Jiang, Lord Tang is severely injured.

247
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.160
The Advisor is someone he loves, how can you not

248
00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.860
let them see each other.

249
00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.870
You came here late. You don't understand how dangerous it was today.

250
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:29.950
Before, Sir Tang betrayed Advisor Tan in court.

251
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:31.730
Who knew she would in turn hate him.

252
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:35.060
Seeking refuge with the bandit Duan Feng.

253
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:38.620
They are the real ones plotting to hurt Sir Tang.

254
00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.120
Why would I let her see him?

255
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.030
Nonsense!

256
00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:46.240
There's no way Advisor Tan would kill Sir. They-

257
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:54.040
Anyway, Advisor wouldn't do that.

258
00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.510
Miss Jiang.

259
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.160
Don't suspect anyone if you don't have evidence.

260
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.060
Evidence? There will always be evidence.

261
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.430
Come.

262
00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:33.030
-Sit down.
-Okay.

263
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.110
I told you not to come.

264
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.000
But I'm afraid he'll die.

265
00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:44.250
A bad person can live 1000 years. He won't die that easily.

266
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:49.250
Hurry up and tell me, from Qingchen getting kidnapped to Lord Tang getting injured,

267
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:51.990
what happened in between?

268
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.570
<i> Phoenix Village </i>

269
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:56.210
Boss, there's a letter.

270
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.790
Just bring the letter, why carry the pigeon. Give it.

271
00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:03.880
Brother, what does it say?

272
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.190
Something has happened in the County Office.

273
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:08.480
What?

274
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:12.220
Zheng Shaofeng said to stay in the mountains and lie low for now.

275
00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.920
We'll wait for his news.

276
00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:19.580
I knew it was him. I will go capture him right now!

277
00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.790
Stop messing around.

278
00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.070
She has taken over the county office under the emperor's orders. If you capture her, aren't you revolting?

279
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:30.170
Then what should we do? That crazy women caused me to-

280
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.870
Caused you to what?

281
00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:36.940
Causing our little Feilong

282
00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:41.080
to get hurt. She's evil!

283
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.420
She came here prepared. And she's under the protection of Zong Yinglin.

284
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:48.070
It's not surprising that we were tricked.

285
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.660
The important thing is Sir.

286
00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.320
He already knew everything and was scared Jiang Muchun would do something to him.

287
00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.430
Xiang Gua is looking after him.

288
00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:03.330
There shouldn't be a big problem. With this matter,

289
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.700
you can't do anything to Jiang Muchun.

290
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.500
If she gets angry and accuses you for trespassing,

291
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.500
no one can protect you.

292
00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.320
It's this serious?

293
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:18.650
You were even talking about me before...

294
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:21.550
You are not an advisor anymore.

295
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.270
Trespassing the county office is considered revolting.

296
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.660
Royals and nobles are all the same.

297
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.710
You are right, we can't let her catch us do anything wrong.

298
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.960
Duan Feng said Lao Tie went to him directly.

299
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.900
It seems like Jiang Muchun bribed Lao Tie.

300
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:46.800
This woman,

301
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.520
planned this long ago and was just waiting for us fall for it.

302
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.930
This woman is evil.

303
00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.720
I want to kill her right now.

304
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.920
That's not right, Head constable Zheng.

305
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.290
What's not right?

306
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.860
There's also Zhou Zhengdao.

307
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.580
We haven't seen him recently.

308
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.900
What is going on?

309
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.690
Where are you going?

310
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.890
Didn't you want to hear a story? I'm going to get wine.

311
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:37.690
Xiang Gua. Xue Li.

312
00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.300
Sir, you're awake.

313
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.920
Where's advisor?

314
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.890
Sir seems to love Advisor deeply.

315
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:02.510
You look for advisor once you're awake.

316
00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.910
But you misjudged her.

317
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:10.310
She teamed up with the bandits to kill you.

318
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:12.610
Does Sir not remember?

319
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.530
Where is Zheng Shaofeng?

320
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:27.440
You're very sick. Don't worry about the duties here.

321
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.380
I've already asked the emperor permission

322
00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:32.980
for me to take care of the affairs here for the time being.

323
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.580
You can rest assure.

324
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.900
In this small Tongling,

325
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.490
what affairs do you need to tend to?

326
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.060
In the end,

327
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.800
isn't this all about Sang Jie's gold case?

328
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.420
What Muchun wants.

329
00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:00.910
She knows it best.

330
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:10.250
Zhou Zhengdao is Zhou Ruyi.

331
00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:14.480
Zhou Ruyi is Zhou Zhengdao.

332
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.180
Tan Lingyin, you are really stupid.

333
00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.860
Are your eyes purely for looks?

334
00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:24.250
You couldn't even tell that apart.

335
00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.890
Older sister.

336
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.320
What were you thinking about?

337
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:31.580
It's nothing.

338
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.440
Why didn't you look at the letter Xiang Gua sent?

339
00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:37.680
What did it say?

340
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.190
The Lord is awake and he is fine.

341
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.560
That's what they all say. Who knows if its the truth.

342
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.840
Right.

343
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.960
There's still my lovely Xiang Gua!

344
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.370
- How much is this carrot? 
 - One coin per catty.

345
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:12.550
Xiang Gua.

346
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.260
Advisor! There are lots of eyes here. You should be careful to avoid suspicion.

347
00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.500
It's okay.

348
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.700
I have a favor to ask you.

349
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.320
A favor? I hate you a lot, why should I help you?

350
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.330
I know you hate me.

351
00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.660
But you should believe that I wouldn't harm the Lord.

352
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.710
Sir.

353
00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.830
There's a reason your master kept you.

354
00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:33.900
I'm coming.

355
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:45.070
-Xiang Gua.
-Lower your voice.

356
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:46.780
This is for you.

357
00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.960
Don't go.

358
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.630
Drink some tea.

359
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.410
Okay.

360
00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.230
Let's go.

361
00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:06.710
There's only two characters.

362
00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:11.370
Oh, right.

363
00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:14.370
Didn't you say Sir's wound didn't go deep into his heart?

364
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:16.940
Why isn't he getting better?

365
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.900
This, I really don't know.

366
00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:25.310
The doctor comes everyday, he drinks it everyday.

367
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.830
Who makes the medicine?

368
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.800
Medicine?

369
00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.300
Miss Jiang makes it herself.

370
00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.600
I'm going to go first.

371
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:53.470
The plan has failed.

372
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.850
That Lao Tie! He was incompetent and caused trouble.

373
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.780
We've lost our clue. What should we do now?

374
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.300
How about Zong Yinglin?

375
00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.310
We are still following him.

376
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.800
It looks like he's running away. He traveling west.

377
00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.850
It's fine if he runs away.

378
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.000
But if he's going to the capital to meet the emperor...

379
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.930
What you are saying-

380
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.090
Yes.

381
00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.490
Wait.

382
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.130
I'll go.

383
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.170
<i> I won't leave. </i>

384
00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:50.680
<i> I owe you for raising me. I can let you go. </i>

385
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.310
<i> But I need to repent for the sins we both have made.</i>

386
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:58.860
<i> You can hide right now, </i>

387
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.820
<i> but how long can you hide for? </i>

388
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.490
<i> You're just putting on a calm facade for the person in charge of you. </i>

389
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.430
<i> You are a smart person. </i>

390
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:10.190
<i> You should know that repentance is salvation. </i>

391
00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:15.410
-Turn around. 
-Yes.

392
00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:17.880
Sir.

393
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.400
Sir.

394
00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.330
Miss Jiang.

395
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:03.930
Are you not allowing me to go back

396
00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.300
and wait for death?

397
00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.370
It's a good thing to go to your hometown.

398
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:11.400
But the direction you are going

399
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.180
is not the direction to your home.

400
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:20.570
Then let me ask.

401
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.360
What good is it to you if I died?

402
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.410
There's no bad thing either.

403
00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.790
But I am an easy person to talk to.

404
00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:32.320
If you agree to giving me the key,

405
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.670
I will let Zhou Ruyi go.

406
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.660
Don't touch her.

407
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:39.560
What do you say?

408
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:45.290
She parted ways with me! I don't recognize her as my daughter anymore!

409
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.990
Do you recognize this?

410
00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.310
It doesn't matter.

411
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:14.870
Your adopted son will definitely avenge you.

412
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.670
What's going on?

413
00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:59.860
We're investigating a case. Step aside!

414
00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:04.200
This is within Tongling's county limits. I'm the head constable of Tongling's County Office. Move!

415
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.840
The knife was quick. It looks like it was an immediate death.

416
00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:25.440
Cong Shun, take the corpse back to the County Office.

417
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.180
Yes.

418
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.960
Head constable Zheng.

419
00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.440
What's wrong?

420
00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.660
Where is your Ruyi jade pendant?

421
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.360
It was on my waist yesterday...

422
00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:46.060
I doesn't matter right now. Clean up this area.

423
00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.170
Hurry! Double check things! Don't leave stuff here.

424
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:40.900
