You should think about it sufficiently and—

No, no. It-It-It's because I'm so taken aback.

No, no. I'm sorry I'm hesitating.

It's not because I can't trust you.

31
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.810
It's because I was thinking about the unhappiness that might come.

- Hyojoo. 
 - Yes?

55
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.310
You know this article about how to deal with fake crying.

56
00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.010
Do all babies fake cry?

57
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.520
Huh?

58
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.200
It's how babies who can't speak express themselves.

59
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.180
Whenever they wish to gain something they want

60
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:49.870
or to grab their parents' attention... I wrote that they fake cry.

61
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.890
Yeah, but they cry for real sometimes.

62
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.470
Add in how to tell the difference.

63
00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:01.710
Besides that, you wrote it well.

64
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.460

Really? Let me see! What?!

68
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.760
This little pretty thing feels surprisingly heavy.

69
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.330
Are you going to be able to write any articles with that heavy thing on your finger?

70

Just please know that we gave Chief Han guidance.

I place a lot of importance on formalities and manners,

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.900

Since I came all the way here, should I say hello to her father?

Hari would freak out. She won't even see him, so would she want you to see him?

I understand.

<i>Yeah.</i>

115
00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.850
As a young child, she must have missed him.

116
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.960
I'm sure she has a lot of pent-up feelings.

117
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.860
That's why her dream is to have an ordinary family and become a mom.

118
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.970
What kind of a kid dreams of a life like that?

I'm asking because I'm sincerely worried.

Listen to me without misunderstanding.

124
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:46.880
Do you even have the possibility of having a child?

125
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:58.150
People for whom babies are like miracles, they hang their hope in even 1%. It will be possible.

126
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:04.550
I sincerely hope it's not false hope.

What did you do with Doha?

146
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:36.940
Doha's mom is looking over her right now.

Of course.

156
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.350
After elementary school, you never saw Hari's face. Right?

157
00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.390
Right.

158
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:37.950
At her elementary school's graduation, she waited for you for a very long time.

159
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.610
Thinking you were buying a flower bouquet.

160
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.830
Flower bouquet?

161
00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:49.230
Did I not go to her graduation?

162
00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.920
Hari was the volunteering president in middle school.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:05.260
Even though she always complained that it was annoying, they let her be a class officer,

164
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:08.060
so she happily cleaned the school by herself.

165
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.660
When a friend named Kihoon broke his arm,

166
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:15.650
she even carried his bag every day, so she got a prize for good conduct.

167
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:18.160
She did?

168
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:26.800
Sir, Hari... grew up kindly and prettily.

169
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.770
What's the relation between you and Hari?

170
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.030
No relation.

171
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.460
Just... a sibling-like friendship.

172
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.330
<i>Like a friend, like siblings...</i>

173
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:58.910
<i>While dating other people, watching each other being in love...</i>

174
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:16.910
<i>Where did you drink so much that you're sitting out on the street? It's cold.</i>

175
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.440
<i>Jaeyoung, I got stood up again.</i>

176
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.210
<i>You went to another blind date that quickly?</i>

177
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.890
<i>Why do I keep getting stood up?</i>

178
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:35.400
<i>I don't think there's a man in this world who likes me.</i>

179
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.200
<i>I like you.</i>

180
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.560
<i>Annoying. Is that supposed to comfort me?</i>

181
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:47.020
<i>Exactly why am I so-so?</i>

182
00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:54.290
<i>You're not so-so... but you're not a man.</i>

183
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:59.820
<i>If you and I date and we separate, it's like losing a family member.</i>

184
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.850
<i>I don't want to lose another family member.</i>

185
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:19.240
That's strange. There's no way you wouldn't have feelings when a man and a woman spend so much time together.

186
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.710
That can't happen.

187
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.990
If you confess and get rejected,

188
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:31.150
what man in the world would stay being friends with a woman he loved?

189
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.000
It's like someone else's house.

190
00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:54.480
Shall I stay beside you until you sleep?

191
00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.570
I'm not going to do anything.

192
00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.790
I'm not such a bad guy that would bother a girlfriend who's tired and down.

193
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:11.600
You can be a little bit bad.

194
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:17.260
Do you want to eat something?

195
00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:22.930
Real... ly? Then... how bad?

196
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.060
You look exactly like your mom when she was younger.

197
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.220
Are you good at cooking?

198
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.270
I cook ramen well.

199
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.030
You only cook ramen well, I see.

200
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.480
Well, I'm good at cooking.

201
00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.940
I can't clean either.

202
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.080
We can just buy a good cleaning machine.

203
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.920
Here! It looks good, right?

204
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.800
It looks good.

205
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.990
I'll give you some.

206
00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.310
- Here.
 - A little.

207
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.240
A little?

208
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:06.540
In the morning, I went and saw your mom.

209
00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.860
You went to the hospital?

210
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.620
Yeah.

211
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.220
I didn't see your father.

212
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:24.040
Well... saying hello to your father would be a bit...

213
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:32.630
I'm not embarrassed about living without a father, but I don't want to show him to you.

214
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:42.400
I am also not embarrassed of my father,

215
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.290
but I didn't want to live like him.

216
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:55.180
He was a great head of the family who worked his entire life to take care of his family,

217
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.160
but he didn't have a life of his own.

218
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:06.430
<i>After he passed away when I was throwing out his clothes and organizing his things,</i>

219
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.790
<i> I was left with two bundles of trash.</i>

220
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:15.850
<i>And... one box of what he left behind.</i>

221
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:25.380
<i>What remained of a 70-year-long life of a brusque man who only worked his entire life as the head of a family</i>

222
00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:31.500
<i>were just two bags of trash and a box of belongings.</i>

223
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:44.790
<i> It must have been because of us, but why did he live like that?</i>

224
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:51.010
He didn't have to do that. It must have been frustrating.

225
00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:02.050
Mom didn't talk about my dad because she didn't want me to have negative thoughts about him.

226
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:05.890
But I heard her talking to my aunt.

227
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:10.890
<i>About the day my mom went to find my father.</i>

228
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.920
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

229
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:20.240
<i>Give me money for living expenses.</i>

230
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.580
<i>What money do I have?</i>

231
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.080
<i>Are you going to starve our child? You need to at least give money for her school fees!</i>

232
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.630
<i>Okay.</i>

233
00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.030
<i>Wait.</i>

234
00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.710
<i>More than the day he left,</i>

235
00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.230
<i>I remember the day Mom was filled with sadness.</i>

236
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.330
<i>My goodness.  It won't stick.</i>

237
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.190
<i>Huh?  Red Dan has stopped. (Game of "Go.")</i>

238
00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.740
<i>Ah, why is the weather so hot?</i>

239
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:01.710
<i>Brother Haeseop's wife?</i>

240
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.180
<i>You should go inside and wait.</i>

241
00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.530
<i>I'll make you some cold coffee.</i>

242
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:11.250
<i>Seriously?</i>

243
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:25.080
<i>Oh, the smoke! Stop smoking so much! We're going to choke.</i>

244
00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.550
<i>Your wife is waiting outside. Stop and go outside.</i>

245
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.240
<i>Yeah. What are you doing? Dole it out!</i>

246
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.080
<i>You won again?</i>

247
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:53.930
<i>Here. I only have this.</i>

248
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.160
<i>Accept it. I really don't have more.</i>

249
00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.580
<i>I said to give me school fees.</i>

250
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.290
<i>If I had more, I'd give it to you. I also feel like dying!</i>

251
00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.750
<i>Whenever you see me, it's all just about money.</i>

252
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:19.610
<i>I felt suffocated, so I left the house but you even follow me here!</i>

253
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.240
<i>Here. Grab this and go.</i>

254
00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.060
<i>She waited all day and received 78,000 won.</i>

255
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.300
<i>She said she felt so pitiful.</i>

256
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:10.190
<i>She wanted to throw the money in his face saying she didn't come to beg,</i>

257
00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:14.110
<i>but with that money,</i>

258
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.100
<i>she wouldn't have to worry about rice for three months,</i>

259
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.880
<i>so she kept it.</i>

260
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.980
<i>Whenever she thought about that day, it made her shudder,</i>

261
00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.980
<i>so with that thought in mind, she decided to clench her teeth and work hard to live.</i>

262
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.230
That's why I can't forgive my father.

263
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:46.750
I really didn't want to talk about this.

264
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.680
The ramen noodles will get bloated.

265
00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:06.760
Your mother worries about you a lot.

266
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:12.530
That you got hurt because of your dad.

267
00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.690
From now on, because of your father,

268
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:23.200
don't dream of an ordinary life.

269
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.600
But while thinking about me, think of being happy together.

270
00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.800
If you can't forgive your father,

271
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.060
you don't have to.

272
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.860
But... meet him once.

273
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.990
If you meet him, your resentful feelings

274
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.570
might be nothing at all.

275
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.840
Can we talk about something else?

276
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:57.870
Something that lifts my mood up.

277
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.600
Shall we?

278
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:05.790
Come here.

279
00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.620
Because you're so pretty right now,

280
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:12.840
I think I should do something wicked.

281
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.570
Oh, so hot, so hot!

282
00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:20.030
Here, here.

283
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.050
Go into the bathroom and wash. I'll go see if there's anything you can wear instead.

284
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.470
- Ouch! 
 - Oh no!

285
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.320
You don't need to change your underwear, do you?

286
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:57.530
You don't need to change your underwear, do you?

287
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.510
Mom, we just ate ramen. 
<i> (T/N: slang for sex)</i>

288
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:14.820
I know it too! "Want to eat ramen?"

289
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.870
Mom, it's not that meaning!

290
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:24.100
You were standing there like that?

291
00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.600
Yisang left.

292
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.100
Okay.

293
00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:57.210
We didn't do anything.

294
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.380
If you weren't going to do anything, why bring him home?

295
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:07.310
Well, if you say it like that, I won't be able to bring him home anymore.

296
00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.290
Yisang asked me to marry him.

297
00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.280
That's good.

298
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.500
Is that it?

299
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.570
Mom, I'm marrying.

300
00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.560
You talked about marriage multiple times back then. It felt like you were married even if you weren't.

301
00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.860
Shall I dance?

302
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:31.190
What is this?

303
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.520
You're not able to properly be happy during times when you should because you're taking care of dad.

304
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.620
It's because of this that I don't want you to meet him.

305
00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.760
See! He appeared and is only making you suffer again.

306
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.770
Why are you making me pitiful?

307
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.490
Daughters probably all think their moms are pitiful,

308
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:53.180
but I don't want my daughter to see me as a woman who was abandoned by her husband and lived pitifully.

309
00:29:55.540 --> 00:30:00.670
If you live your life while holding onto my pain, how can I live while burdening you?

310
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:07.420
The past is nothing to me now, so why are you using it to resent your father and have a hard time?

311
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:11.050
Are you really seeing dad because you're indifferent?

312
00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:13.830
After living with so much sadness?

313
00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.800
Is it really because you're okay?

314
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.990
I'm doing this because I don't want to see him again.

315
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.550
Your father is being discharged tomorrow.

316
00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.070
You and I won't ever have to see him again.

317
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.220
Don't get upset for no reason.

318
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.370
You should let it go already.

319
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:51.360
Eutteum, did you hurt your hand?

320
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.070
I'm okay.

321
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.040
Hold on, wait.

322
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:03.190
Did you teleport?

323
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.620
Quickly, give me your hand.

324
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.590
So it's like this.

325
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.280
Mistaking kindness...

326
00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:25.460
I guess if someone is nice to you, you could misunderstand.

327
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.530
I will have to be careful.

328
00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:36.940
R-Right. There are people who misunderstand kindness.

329
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.060
I also...

330
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:45.980
Anyway, just be kind to me who knows you well. Okay?

331
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:50.150
Since you know I don't like you that way,

332
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.260
you must not misunderstand then.

333
00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.810
I know. I won't misunderstand again,

334
00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.050
so only be nice to me.

335
00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:03.470
Okay.

336
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:10.690
Word hard!

337
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:28.460
Chief Editor, I met my deadline. Can I go home?

338
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.380
Yeah, go ahead.

339
00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:36.250
Manager Kim wants someone to go to the new baby store that's opening this weekend.

340
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.070
To help get an advertisement contract.

341
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:40.820
Eutteum is going. Who wants to go?

342
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.390
I'll go.

343
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:46.600
You will? That's a first.

344
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.360
I'm the only one who can go.

345
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.920
Good job, everyone!

346
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.620
Goodbye.

347
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.560
Bye.

348
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.170
That-That transparent girl.

349
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.230
Aren't you going home?

350
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.630
Leave first.

351
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.560
Then I'll be going.

352
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.380
Oh...

353
00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.790
It's bone broth. Make sure to eat it well.

354
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.410
Why did you do this?

355
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:26.650
Don't be sick until you die.

356
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.040
Don't waste your money and start saving so you can go to a care home.

357
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.680
Don't ask for help from Hari.

358
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.660
Don't burden her,

359
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.460
so be healthy and live well

360
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:39.220
and die quietly.

361
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.060
That's why I took care of you.

362
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.300
How can you talk that way?

363
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:47.000
Because I didn't want my child to worry,

364
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.440
that it might interfere with her work.

365
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.480
If the surgery didn't go well, I could die without seeing her face,

366
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:56.190
and I was shaking with fear but I didn't contact her.

367
00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.990
Don't be a burden to your child and die alone.

368
00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:01.470
To your child who you've never done anything for,

369
00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:03.410
do that at least.

370
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.910
You don't even know why you live so pitifully.

371
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.680
Why do you live like that?

372
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.120
Jang Taeseop, let's never see each other again.

373
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:00.440
Thank you for coming to see me.

374
00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.630
Don't come ever again.

375
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.400
Don't bother Mom. I came to tell you that.

376
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:14.870
I might die during surgery, so I came to see you for the last time.

377
00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.450
I only borrowed the money for a little while because I didn't have enough for surgery.

378
00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:24.690
I was going to pay it back when I got insurance money.

379
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:30.640
I won't bother you, so don't worry.

380
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:44.010
Were you... okay with not having us around?

381
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.430
I was lonely.

382
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.020
Goodbye.

383
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.890
Okay. Bye.

I heard you were upset because of this.

386
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:48.590
Why? You don't like it?

387
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.070

Hello, I'm Reporter Choi Yoojoo from "the baby." Hello.

394
00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.740
Yes.

395
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:00.150
Thanks for the proposal.

396
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:06.530
But I don't understand how you would use our product to make a song and dance with.

397
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.110
The main item,

398
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:11.600
in order to make these organic stretchy pants a trend,

399
00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.820
we will make a popular video clip.

400
00:38:17.090 --> 00:38:22.370
Look. ♪ Tug, tug, pull, pull, it stretches so well! ♪

401
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:27.060
Reporter, a magazine ad is possible, too. Right?

402
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:31.320
Rated as the national stretchy pants! Pants that moms and babies alike love!

403
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.870
We will stimulate moms' desire to buy with a professional ad!

404
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:37.900
My favorite!

405
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.320
I understand.

406
00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:50.920
Because of you, they signed the advertisement contract. Thank you.

407
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.280
You're thankful, right?

408
00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.810
If you're thankful, let's go to the beach.

409
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:56.700
The beach?

410
00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.390
If you're thankful, you go to the beach. Don't you know that?

411
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.240
Let's go.

412
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.090
If I'm thankful...

413
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.930
It's nice that we came, right?

414
00:39:07.930 --> 00:39:13.400
You're right. I can see why it's the beach when you're thankful.

415
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.130
But are you going to keep working at the company?

416
00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.240
Shall I say... vision?

417
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:37.630
Don't you have any grand ambitions or aspirations?

418
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.060
My dream was to become a saxophonist,

419
00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:46.290
but that's for the 1% that have the talent and passion.

420
00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:51.280
And an average person like me has to do it as a hobby because I like it.

421
00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:57.090
It was hard for me to get hired, so my dream was to become a company employee,

422
00:39:57.090 --> 00:40:01.430
and I found out what the advertisement business is all about once I got in.

423
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:04.330
But it ended up suiting my personality.

424
00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:07.700
I'm sure you'll be good.

425
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:12.030
You're untainted and yet smart.

426
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:16.720
I am? I've never heard anyone say that about me.

427
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:22.440
No, you're very sparkly.

428
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.370
Thank you.

429
00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:30.780
Then... what do you think about me?

430
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.550
About you?

431
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:40.690
You have a bouncy charm. 
 <i>(T/N: Bouncy as in bubbly.)</i>

432
00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.370
Am I a trampoline or what? Bouncy...

433
00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:50.570
Then... shall we bounce on the beach?

434
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.050
Where are you going?

435
00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.460
Be careful. You'll get wet.

436
00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:01.730
It's okay.

437
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:12.850
- Watch out! 
 - Oh, these are new Balenciagas!

438
00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:15.660
I'll buy you some the next time.

439
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.890
Liar.

440
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.030
Careful!

441
00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:48.890
What do we do with these? There's tons of sand inside.

442
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:55.280
I'll buy you some nicer ones later.

443
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:59.790
Reporter Choi,

444
00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.930
do you perhaps like me?

445
00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:29.470
From now on... instead of a person liking me,

446
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:34.890
I want to date someone I like and experience real love.

447
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:46.560
It'll be better not to apologize, right?

448
00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:55.060
Yes. Don't do it.

449
00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.600
<i>The lump has become a tiny bit bigger.</i>

450
00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:48.750
<i>We have a few months until the follow-up exam, but are you going to push back the surgery?</i>

451
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.380
The progress isn't good.

452
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:06.160
It's not like there's no sperm, so it's not impossible for pregnancy.

453
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.150
But since the person you're marrying is also infertile,

454
00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:16.190
we need at least the minimum figure for in vitro.

455
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:20.910
The treatment this time wasn't effective.

456
00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:25.990
Why don't we try another treatment next time?

459
00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.620

460
00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.160

What it's like to become a father,

463
00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:14.000
It was vague to me...

464
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:22.860
But while dreaming about it with Hari, I guess I had an expectation without realizing it.

465
00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:34.010
I... may not become a father.

466
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.700
What does that mean?

467
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:44.130
It's hard? You can't?

468
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:52.470
This must be how Hari felt.

Hello? Hello?

481
00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.210
Hari!

482
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.570
Hello?

483
00:48:36.570 --> 00:48:40.200
Hey, Jang Hari. Are you okay?

484
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.140
<i>Open the door.</i>

485
00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.020
<i>Open it. </i>

486
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:44.790
Jang Hari!

487
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:47.300
<i>What's the matter?</i>

488
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.170
What's wrong? What's going on?

489
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:51.970
Aunt, something must have happened to Hari.

490
00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:54.380
<i>Jang Hari! Hey!</i>

491
00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:56.860
Open up!

492
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.560
Hari. Hey, Jang Hari.

493
00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.350
What's wrong?

494
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.930
What's wrong? Hari! Oh my. What's wrong?

495
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.330
What's going on?

496
00:49:12.330 --> 00:49:13.520
Auntie, we need to get her to the emergency room.

497
00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.620
Okay, let's hurry.

498
00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.460
- Stand up. 
 - Can you stand up?

499
00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:18.110
Let's get to the hospital! What do we do?!

500
00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:19.450
What do we do?

501
00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:23.160
<i> [Yisang] </i>

502
00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:51.580
Hari's okay, right?

503
00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:54.560
She's sleeping after an exam and pain reliever.

504
00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.810
I think it's endometriosis. You can go and see her.

505
00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.250
I'll be going, Aunt.

506
00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:06.260
Okay. Thank you, Jaeyoung.

507
00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:09.290
- Sure, go inside. 
 - Okay.

508
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.790
Han Yisang.

509
00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:24.390
If it was me, Hari wouldn't be having such a hard time.

510
00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.790
Please don't make me keep having thoughts like that.

511
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:35.170
Please.

512
00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.730
Sleep more. You need to finish the IV before you can leave.

513
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.810
Stay lying down.

514
00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:12.020
You came?

515
00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:16.300
My back hurts now. It's not like I have a terminal disease.

516
00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.430
It embarrasses me if you keep worrying like this. It's not a big illness.

517
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:23.420
Jang Hari.

518
00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.730
You're not hurting right now, right?

519
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.370
No.

520
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.030
The lump from the endometriosis got a little bigger than the last time.

521
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:38.630
I don't think it's good to leave you as is. What about going through the surgery?

522
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:43.990
If I do the surgery, it becomes harder to have a baby. Right?

523
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.060
We'll have to see how it progresses, but there's a good chance it'll reduce ovarian function.

524
00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:50.920
As I told you last time,

525
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:56.060
even without endometriosis, your fertility level is already low.

526
00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:01.340
So after a treatment of about a year after surgery, it could become harder than it is now.

527
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.720
It's not like she won't be able to have a baby, right?

528
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:13.300
It would be good to get an infertility procedure done, but it's not impossible.

529
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.070
I... made you have expectations.

530
00:52:58.970 --> 00:53:04.210
If you're pushing back the surgery because of me, don't do that.

531
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:09.630
You remember what I said, right?

532
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:16.990
If my results aren't good, to only think of yourself?

533
00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:22.620
What's wrong?

534
00:53:35.090 --> 00:53:37.510
My results aren't good.

535
00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:48.030
Three months... even if I get treated for another three months,

536
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:53.900
I can't be certain of the results.

537
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:03.620
If you're holding the pain in,

538
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:13.860
waiting for me, don't do that.

539
00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:21.000
I only did it because it'll become harder for me.

540
00:54:22.590 --> 00:54:25.510
It's not because of you.

541
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:35.060
She said it's still possible even after the surgery.

542
00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:39.690
Even if we have to find the solution again later,

543
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:44.290
receive the surgery for now.

544
00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.060
Are you okay?

545
00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:54.190
You're also having a hard time.

546
00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:01.230
I'm okay.

547
00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.520
What is it?

548
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.300
Because of Hari not feeling well?

549
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:24.490
You want to delay the wedding?

550
00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:27.390
No. I'm not thinking that.

551
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:37.470
Because of me, Hari will try and push back the surgery even if she's hurting.

552
00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:47.030
So... if you could please convince her.

553
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:49.550
It's because of you?

554
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.880
Yes.

555
00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.760
I...

556
00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:04.660
It's hard for me to have a baby right now.

557
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:16.260
I am also... infertile.

558
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:24.240
The doctor said that I could get better by receiving treatment,

559
00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:31.950
but recently, the exam results weren't good.

560
00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:12.450
Here. Eat even if you don't have an appetite.

561
00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:14.850
Eat it and gain energy.

562
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.960
Get the surgery.

563
00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:28.550
I felt bad for you who grew up without a father.

564
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.150
But when you started speaking nonsense about having a baby alone,

565
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:36.200
I wondered how you were going to be able to bear looking at your poor child later on.

566
00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.120
I couldn't even stop you.

567
00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:43.340
Since you found a nice person, I don't worry about that now.

568
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.530
But you have to give up what you can't do and live your life doing what you can.

569
00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:59.040
Mom... telling me to get surgery sounds like I'm being told to give up having a baby.

570
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:04.060
I have thought about the fact that I could live without a baby,

571
00:59:05.450 --> 00:59:09.860
but how can I give up so quickly because it can't happen?

572
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:16.340
If I can't... I can never live as a mom.

573
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:26.330
I was... so busy trying to just survive,

574
00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:29.720
I didn't even know when I was tired.

575
00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:35.940
Back then, I resented having a life where nothing went right.

576
00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:39.370
But when I looked back, I wasn't unfortunate.

577
00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:43.360
I had just lived diligently day by day.

578
00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:50.100
Things may seem so dire right now, but you won't become unfortunate because of this.

579
00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.850
I believe that you won't live that way.

580
01:00:05.550 --> 01:00:07.320
Let's eat.

581
01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.030
Go ahead.

582
01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:39.580
<i>[You're right.]</i>

583
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.930
Are you okay?

584
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:14.390
Way better than I thought.

585
01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:16.480
In front of me—

586
01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.120
Let's go. I'll be late.

587
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:26.050
Let's go eat something delicious for dinner. We haven't gone to a lot of places.

588
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:40.030
Senior, you came?

589
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:50.120
- Are you okay? 
 - Yeah.

590
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:54.790
You should rest up more.

591
01:02:54.790 --> 01:02:56.920
I came out because I'm fine.

592
01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.730
There's a lot to do, right? What do I need to do first?

593
01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:03.100
Don't concentrate on work just because you feel uneasy.

594
01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.420
It's not like you can focus on work.

595
01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:13.880
How about sorting out the recommended reading list then?

596
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.000
<i>Way better than I thought.</i>

597
01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:35.700
<i> I selected the shots. I'll leave them downstairs, so pick them up later.</i>

598
01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.860
<i>I took the shots, so, of course, they came out well!</i>

599
01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:42.710
Bro, I'll take it over.

600
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.820
