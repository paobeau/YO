00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300
(Previously on Episode 20)
I don't approve of it.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Yasi has just reached

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.940
the standard of being my son-in-law.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.260
Obeying rules and behaving properly

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.740
are very important.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.820
Master.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.500
Miss, please get a hold of yourself.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:53.980
Why did you suddenly do that?

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:16.060
(Episode 21: Sometimes, love is two people
looking at their own maps)

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.980
Are you Shen Mengjun's family?

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.620
Yes. I'm her husband.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.980
I'll come straight to the point.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.700
Shen Mengjun's condition

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.620
doesn't bode well.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.260
Judging from the group consultation

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.780
and inspection reports,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
we think she suffers from

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.780
bipolar disorder.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.060
Manic depression.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.460
Right. It's previously known
as manic depression.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.700
This is a mental disorder

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.900
characterized by periods of depression

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.500
and abnormally elevated moods.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.940
Is she

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.220
abnormally irritable sometimes

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.820
and very depressed

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.180
at other times?

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.980
Yes.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.860
It's true

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500
that she has mood swings.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.180
She's sensitive

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.580
and fragile,

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.740
but

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.780
we didn't take it seriously.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.340
Mr. Gu,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300
what are the possible treatment plans
for my mom?

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.860
Generally,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.780
there are medication, psychotherapy

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.500
and environmental interventions.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.980
But the treatment of manic depression

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.340
is time-consuming.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.820
As her family,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.900
you have to be mentally prepared.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:28.460
Come in please.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.300
Fanzhou.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.540
Uncle Zhao.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.340
Yichun?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.620
Why are you here?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.380
I have nothing to do in summer vacation,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.660
so I got an internship here.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.100
Professor,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.460
psychotherapy has been provided
for the No. 19 patient.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.900
Here is the clinical record.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.180
Fanzhou, what's wrong?

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.900
Go have a look at mom.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.860
Are you okay?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.940
Is there anything

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.260
I can do to help you?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.580
No.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.380
You can leave me alone.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.540
I have some questions

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.620
to discuss with the professor.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.740
I'm leaving.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.620
At present, Beijing Xieping Hospital

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.420
is the most authoritative as for treatment
of manic depression.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.860
If conditions permit,

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.620
I suggest you take her to Beijing.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.260
Fanzhou,

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.620
I have something to say to you.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.700
The day after tomorrow, I'm afraid

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.620
I can't

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.620
go to Beijing with you.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.460
Are you not going?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.700
Here is the thing.

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.860
My client

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.260
who was driven away by your mom

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.900
called me again.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.700
He said he'd sign the contract with me,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.020
but he wants to sign it

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.380
the day after tomorrow.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.460
You...

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.940
You understand me, right?

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.660
I've been following up the project
for over two years.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.620
This is the critical moment.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:00.260
Look...

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.860
I know.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.620
I'll take my mom there.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.540
Oh.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.140
Take this.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.860
Be thrifty at home
and spend liberally while travelling.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.540
Take it.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.540
It'll be of use in case of emergency.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.100
You think money is the solution
to every problem.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.820
Hello? Mr. Wang.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.540
No problem.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.420
You're welcome.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.100
(Zhou Xiao)

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.980
Hello?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.100
Why didn't you reply on WeChat?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.820
How is it going with your family?

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.980
I was a little busy at hospital,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.340
so I missed it.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:43.820
At hospital?

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:45.580
What happened to your mom?

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.580
Nothing special.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.300
She's just emotionally unstable.

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.780
That's a relief.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.300
Don't worry.

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:55.300
Why are you staying up?

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.860
To call you.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.940
You didn't call me, so I have to call you.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.980
I've got everything handled here.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:05.420
Go to sleep.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:06.860
Sir,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.940
I have something to report to you.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.780
Approved.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.220
I was notified tonight

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.580
that writing summer camp
will start in advance,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.340
so I'll go to Beijing by high-speed rail
the day after tomorrow.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.900
You're going to Beijing
the day after tomorrow?

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.220
Right.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:21.860
What's wrong?

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.180
No. Nothing.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.340
Take good care of yourself.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.180
Call me when you miss me.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.260
Then I'll never hang up.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:39.060
I never knew you could be so cheesy.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.940
I'll report to the police
if you keep doing that.

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.780
Please get a good lawyer for me.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.340
The lawyer told me

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.660
you'd receive a life sentence.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.940
Okay. Got it.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.420
Okay.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.780
I'll take some back to you later.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.060
Okay. No problem.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.140
I gotta go.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.340
Alright. Good night.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.540
Good night.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.740
Mom, you're awake.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.900
I've got you breakfast.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.940
Eat something.

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.700
Why am I in hospital?

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.340
I remember yesterday your dad...

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.220
Hmm.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.020
Yesterday,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.740
I took you here with him.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.660
Can I be discharged?

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.380
Mom,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:44.180
the doctor said you're emotionally unstable.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.220
We'd better go to Beijing for some checkup.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:48.980
I'm fine.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.460
I'm fine. I won't go there.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.180
Where is your dad?

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:57.940
He's left.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:01.220
What?

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.380
I'm going to Beijing for checkup,
but he has left.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.340
He left me alone again.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.900
Mom, he...

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.820
He's gone to Beijing

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.540
to book a hospital bed.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.220
Really?

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.980
It proves

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:24.740
he still cares about me,

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.300
right?

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.140
Yes.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.140
He still cares about me.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.540
He cares about me.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:38.740
He cares about me.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.420
Take good care of yourself in Beijing.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.540
And give us a call

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.180
when you arrive.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:49.860
Don't just call Zhao.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.420
Got it.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.700
Don't say that.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.660
Who is it? Fanzhou?

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:03.940
Hello?

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.700
I'm setting out for Beijing.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.460
Have you packed up?

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:08.900
Yep, I have.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:10.260
How is it going with you?

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.540
Is your mom getting better?

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.100
We're at...

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.620
Let me talk to him.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.420
I'm carrying my luggage.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.300
I'll call you later.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.780
Come on.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.220
I want to talk to him.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.460
I don't think it's necessary.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:31.500
He's my son-in-law.

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.260
It's been a long time since I last saw him.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.460
I want to know if all is well with him.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.980
Stop. Son-in-law?

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.540
Did you ask me about it?

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.020
Yasi is my son-in-law.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.100
Then you need to have another daughter

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.060
and marry her to Yasi.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.020
Mom and dad, hurry up,

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.220
or I'll miss the train.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.220
Hurry, or she'll miss the train.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.380
Don't make trouble.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.050
Fanzhou.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.200
Was it your girlfriend

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.020
who doesn't eat carrot?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.580
She hung up on you?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.390
Fanzhou,

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:13.100
I've gone through it.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.260
You have to listen to me.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.060
Catch her if you like her,

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.820
or she may

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.100
slip away from you anytime.

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.260
So, listen to me. I'll tell you what to do.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:22.060
You should make every attempt

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.380
to let her stay by your side.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.740
As long as you make it,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.100
nothing will go wrong with your relationship.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:27.580
Mom.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:28.740
Mom.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.420
Drink some water.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.740
Fanzhou,

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.180
when we arrive in Beijing,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.020
will your dad come pick us up?

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:59.100
He doesn't have a car in Beijing.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700
How can he do that?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.820
Yeah. You're right.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.620
It's inconvenient.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.260
We can go to the hospital by taxi.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:07.740
Hmm.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.780
Passengers to Beijing, attention please.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:12.420
Let's go.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:13.900
Okay.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.660
Right.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.100
We can't miss the flight,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.820
or your dad will be anxious.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.260
Let's go.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.020
Go.

checked in for this flight

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:24.180

You forgot to take the medical report.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:52.500
Okay.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.500
Mom.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.780
Take a seat. I'll get the medical report.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:19.860
Sorry!

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.860
The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

Sorry.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.660
Where is your dad?

The number you have dialed
cannot be connected for the moment.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.060
Mom, let's finish the checkup first.

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.060
I'll tell you about it later.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.100
Answer me. Where is your dad?

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.380
You told me he was waiting for us in Beijing.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.060
He left again, right?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.420
Calm down.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:48.340
I'll explain to you after the checkup.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.940
I see.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:57.860
I see.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:01.260
You were lying to me, right?

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:04.500
Your dad didn't come to Beijing at all.

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:07.420
Right?

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:09.220
Mom.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.490
-Mom, calm down. -He didn't come.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.380
You ganged up with him and lied to me.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.500
Both of you lied to me.

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.260
You two liars.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.860
You two liars.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.420
Calm down.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.020
I'm going home.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:17.460
Mom.

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.260
I'm going home.

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:19.220
I'm going home.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:19.780
Mom.

It's okay.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.580
Let me clean it up. Are you injured?

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.300

Which department?

Thank you.

I have something to say to you.

It's basically confirmed

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:31.220
your mother is suffering from

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.540
hereditary manic depression.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:33.660
I suggest you have a checkup

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.820
in our hospital.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:35.980
Next.

Excuse me.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:38.540
It's your turn.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:40.780
Sorry.

Never mind.

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.180
I want to register.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.140
For what?

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.100

Zhao Fanzhou.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.060
Why are you here?

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.420
Why are you here?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:19.700
Why have you got all this medicine?

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.220
I had a mild stomachache.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.060
I'm fine.

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:24.700
You wouldn't have come here if it were true.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.300
I said I'm fine. Trust me.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:27.980
Why on earth are you in hospital?

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.460
My mom is hospitalized.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.300
You said you were at hospital.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.300
You meant a hospital in Beijing?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:38.020
Hmm.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.460
Why didn't you tell me

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.500
when I said I'd be here for a summer camp?

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.860
I was afraid you'd be worried.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:47.340
I want to visit your mom.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:49.020
She's having a rest.

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.500
Are you hiding something from me?

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:56.820
No.

It's you that have an incurable disease,
right?

No.

Why do you think I have an incurable disease?

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.460
You just got one lunchbox.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.500
It means you are in hospital alone.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.500
Your mom is not.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.820
I had lunch.

It's for my mom.

What?

I've been too busy.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.660
I mistook my ID card as my mom's.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.580
Why didn't you tell me

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.820
you were in Beijing?

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:36.780
Because my mom is being treated
in the Department of Psychiatry.

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:39.980
Are you afraid?

00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:42.100
Your mom suffers...

Manic depression.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.940
You didn't tell me

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:59.940
because you didn't want me to be scared?

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:02.940
Hmm.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.900

Don't look down upon me.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.780
When I was a kid,
I dared to stir up a hornets' nest.

Then why are you crying?

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:25.940
I am not.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.500
I'm not.

she needs to have a rest-cure.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.180

I won't make any noise.

I'm worried

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.420
you'll be scared if she has a sudden episode.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:02.860
I'm a coward,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.460
but I forget bad things easily.

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:08.860
It's a deal.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.060
You're not allowed to say no.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:12.100
You should've told me earlier.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.380
Then I'd be able to see your mom
for a few more days.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.300
But you didn't tell me

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.300
until the last day of my summer camp.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.580
Anyway, I have to see your mom.

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.380
I'll change my flight.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:22.380
The change fee is on you. Double.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.100
No.

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.700
Triple.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:26.780
Okay.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.140
I must leave.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.220
Go back.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.260
Bye.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.060
Bye.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.420
So,

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:50.380
Zhao Fanzhou didn't tell you
when he went to Beijing?

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:51.820
Right.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:53.500
Because his mom was sick

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:54.220
and he didn't want me to worry about him.

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:55.860
He's considerate.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:58.900
So you met him at the hospital?

00:22:59.180 --> 00:22:59.460
Yes.

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.460
What a small world.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.620
Is it an idol drama?

00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.500
When will you go home?

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.900
I had planned to go back tomorrow,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:09.180
but I changed my flight
to the day after tomorrow,

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.180
now that I want to see his mom.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.940
But I'm very nervous

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.820
at the thought of going to see her.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.500
What to do?

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.900
Don't be nervous. Let me tell you.

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.860
Kneel down and call her mom when you see her.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.540
Then she won't say no to your relationship.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.500
Maybe

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.660
you should buy some gift.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.460
Don't change the subject.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.340
What we're discussing about

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.180
is Zhao Fanzhou went to Beijing

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.500
without communicating with Zhou Xiao.

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.020
But

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.340
he did that for Zhou Xiao's sake.

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.980
You've never been in a relationship.
You know nothing.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.620
Hey. Lu,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.220
I don't allow you to deprive Luo Wei
of her right to speak

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:43.140
just because she's single.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.260
We just did. So what?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.860
Happy?

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:49.580
I gotta go.

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:03.020
What on earth has happened
between Zhou Xiao and Fanzhou?

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:04.340
Why are you so angry?

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.020
You guys don't understand.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.900
Zhao Fanzhou
didn't want Zhou Xiao to get worried,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:09.300
so, without saying anything,

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:11.620
he took his mom to Beijing for treatment.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:12.620
Fanzhou?

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.180
Well done. He's manly.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.500
Bullshit.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.660
He considers himself always in the right
and wouldn't share his feelings.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.700
I can't bear it.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:19.700
So,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.740
have you met such a guy?

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:22.500
No.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.100
Really?

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:25.380
Judging from your look,

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.260
I think you have your own story.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.420
I said no.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.060
Your ex?

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.860
You don't know my ex?

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.580
Yes, I do.

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.740
But I don't think

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:42.580
Chen Yu should be considered as your ex.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.460
I want to correct

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:46.980
your definition of an ex.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.940
He's never been serious

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:49.820
about your relationship.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.580
So, in the strict sense,

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.140
I am your first love.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.260
What are you murmuring about?

00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:56.820
I think

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.500
it's necessary to correct you.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:24:59.980
About what?

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:01.860
That you don't have an ex.

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.420
I don't?

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:04.180
You don't.

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.700
Then do you wanna be my ex?

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.340
I got it wrong.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:09.300
Let's go.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.060
Are you crazy, Xie Yixing?

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:17.980
I'll kill you.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:35.100
(Keep the door closed)

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:36.900
Look.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.060
I heard this medicine works well.

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.260
Mom, we can't take medicine at will.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:47.940
We need to listen to doctors.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:25:59.620
Mom,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:00.900
Zhou Xiao is here.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:02.300
Hi, Mrs. Zhao.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.580
Mom,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.900
she's my girlfriend,

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:11.620
Zhou Xiao.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.100
Zhou Xiao.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.380
Hi, Mrs. Zhao.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.020
Hi.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:16.940
Come on.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:17.940
Take a seat.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.820
Is this your hamper?

00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:36.980
It's left outside.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.740
Sorry. It's mine.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:41.460
Thank you.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.500
Mrs. Zhao, this is for you.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.380
Thank you.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.260
Are you Shen Mengjun's family?

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.380
Yes, I am.

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.260
Dr. Zhang wants to see you in his office.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:53.180
Okay.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:56.220
It's okay. Go ahead.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.820
I'll stay here with your mom.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:04.860
Sit.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.300
Okay.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:11.940
You...

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.980
You really never eat carrot?

00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:16.900
No, I don't.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.940
But how did you know that?

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.460
Fanzhou told me.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.300
Shen Mengjun, time to take medicine.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.100
Zhang, look.

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.220
This is my son's girlfriend.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:34.340
Hi.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.780
But it's time for you to take medicine.

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:38.300
Alas.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.340
It's so dirty.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:41.540
It's full of dust.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.260
Zhou Xiao, look. Am I right? It's dusty.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.020
It must've been used for several days.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.500
It was changed yesterday.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.420
Take the medicine.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.460
Look. Even your daughter-in-law
is here to look after you.

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:07.940
You should be cooperative
and take medicine in time.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.660
It's bitter.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.860
Fanzhou is not here. I don't have to take it.

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:25.980
Don't tell him.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.580
Okay.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.300
Throw it away.

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.700
I'll hide it for you.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:39.140
Is it hidden?

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:39.780
Yeah.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.820
Dr. Zhang,

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.900
is my mom's condition improving?

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:47.620
Yeah.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:50.380
Her symptoms are typical.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:51.820
At present,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:53.180
medication

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.060
works well for her.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.340
Don't worry.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.220
Then why do you want to see me?

00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.260
I told you to take genetic testing last time.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.020
Did you do it?

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.220
I've been too busy to do that.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:07.140
I didn't mean to be a busybody.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.740
It's just that you're a man
of striking appearance...

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:09.660
I see.

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:11.020
Thank you.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.100
As for genetic testing,

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.540
you have to take it seriously.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:14.900
The chance of inheritance
from parent to offspring

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.220
is 15% to 20%.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.740
You know well what it means.

00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.020
Yes.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.820
And genetic testing takes a long time.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.660
It takes two or three months
to get the results.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.380
You'd better schedule your time
appropriately.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:29.060
Okay.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:30.540
Thank you.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.620
You don't break down apple peels.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.260
When I was little, my dad told me

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.660
my wishes would come true

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.220
if I could peel an apple
without breaking down its peels.

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:54.580
You even believed that?

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.460
There is no harm in doing that.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:03.980
Alright.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.100
Mrs. Zhao, here you are.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.260
The apple is for yourself?

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.060
You just said you didn't want to eat it,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.340
so I give you the chance

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.020
to make a wish.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.020
Do I have to make a wish on apple peels?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.460
I feel like it's stupid.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:28.700
Look.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.100
You have nothing to lose

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.620
if it doesn't come true.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.260
It's worth trying,

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.100
right?

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:34.420
Make a wish. Hurry.

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.460
Make a wish.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:37.980
Okay.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:46.940
I wish

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.740
Fanzhou's dad

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.980
wouldn't divorce me.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.420
Divorce.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.780
Shen Mengjun,

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:58.340
you're so bad-tempered.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.180
I can't bear living with you anymore.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:01.220
I want a divorce!

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:02.180
Divorce?

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.980
You think you're rich enough, right?

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.020
You wanna abandon me
now that you're rich, right?

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.900
What about our son if we get divorced?

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.540
I'll take care of him.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.980
I'll divorce you

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:11.940
even if I have to leave with nothing!

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:13.820
Every minute I spend with you

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.220
is a torture!

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.020
Divorce.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:26.780
Divorce.

00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:27.940
Mrs. Zhao.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.860
Are you okay, Mrs. Zhao?

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.500
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:36.380
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.660
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:39.220
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:39.980
Mom.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.020
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:41.580
Calm down.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.020
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:43.500
Zhou Xiao,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:44.260
get a doctor here.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.220
Why are you staring at me? Why?

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:46.940
Calm down, mom.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:47.940
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.500
Mom, I'm here.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.580
Why are you staring at me?

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:49.980
Mom.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.140
Take a sip. It's a little hot.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.940
It's hot today. I don't want hot drinks.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:11.940
It'll help you get over the shock.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.180
You need it more.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:16.860
You're more scared.

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.660
I'm worried about you.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:26.620
I know.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:45.380
I'm sorry.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.220
Never mind.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.620
Is your mom asleep?

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:24.940
She took medicine.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:25.980
She's asleep now.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.020
Why are you here?

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:29.180
I was about to go see you off.

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:31.060
I'm here so that you can see me off.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.340
How about going in and taking a seat?

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.220
Don't bother.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.220
Your mom is asleep.
We'd better not bother her.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.300
Is she emotionally stable today?

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:47.220
Yeah. She's quite good.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:48.380
Don't worry.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:51.980
Let's go.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.180
I'll go to the airport with you.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.380
Don't bother.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.780
Stay and take care of your mom.

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:56.780
She'll be fine.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:57.580
Let's go.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:00.900
Okay.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.380
The time is just right.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.500
Why do you look upset?

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.700
No.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.660
I need to send a message.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.100
Hello? Dad.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:36.020
I'm at the security checkpoint.

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.100
I'll be home at 6 p.m.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.580
Let's say goodbye here.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:50.900
What's up?

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.460
Evening rush hour will start soon.

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:53.380
It'll be hard for you to hail a taxi.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:55.860
You rescheduled your flight anyway.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:57.940
Why didn't you stay here for a few more days?

00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:58.940
Huh?

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.020
Nothing.

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.780
You hate to part with me.

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:04.420
Right?

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:05.940
No.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.180
Really?

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:08.980
Then I'm leaving.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:40.540
I'm leaving.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.900
I'll miss you

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:43.620
so so so so much.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:02.740
Alright.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:24.900
We're home.

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:28.740
We're finally home.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.780
We're home.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.700
I need to lie down on the sofa for a while.

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.780
Let me lie down for a while.

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.380
-Are you that tired? -So tired!

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:40.300
You just went to Beijing
for a writing program.

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.180
Can that be more tired than I work
from nine to five correcting homework?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.380
I'm exhausted.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:48.580
I also went to see Zhao Fanzhou's mom.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:49.020
His...

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:50.220
Sorry? Who?

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.660
No.

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:54.380
Xiao.

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:55.540
What's wrong?

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.620
What happened?

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.780
Actually, Zhao Fanzhou's mom is hospitalized,

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:03.660
so I went to see her.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.620
You met his parent?

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.140
You did that without my consent?

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.220
What are you doing?

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:14.620
What happened to his mom?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:16.500
Well.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.540
She caught a cold and had a fever.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.540
She's getting better.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.220
That'd be great.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.620
Did you get along with each other?

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.740
Did she like you?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.900
Did you behave yourself

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:29.420
in the presence of her?

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.940
How can she not like my daughter?

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.620
Besides,
I haven't agreed to their relationship.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:33.500
I agree.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:35.660
Hey. Do I have the final say

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.620
in this household?

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.100
No.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:38.180
Chen Lijuan!

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.180
Zhou Zhenguo!

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.900
The "common cold" of mental illness

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.300
is also a cold, right?

00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:52.580
(Beijing Xieping Hospital Registration Form
Department of Genetics)

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:55.540
Next.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.340
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:14.180
The new semester is about to start.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.260
When will you come back?

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:17.820
My dad is here at the hospital.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.780
He'll take care of my mom.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:21.540
He asked me to go back for registration.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:22.940
Now that your dad is there,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.220
things could be easier for you.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:25.380
Hmm.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.300
But I'm wondering

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:30.700
if he can take care of my mom

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:31.660
by himself.

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.020
What did the doctor say?

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:36.380
He said

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:40.180
my mom's condition is stable

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:41.380
and we can give it a try.

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.460
What do you think?

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.260
I'm still a little worried.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:48.060
It doesn't matter.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.020
I'll support you no matter what you do.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.820
I'm your fangirl.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:54.620
Fangirl,

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.820
have you packed up for returning to school?

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.140
Um. How about you?

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.940
Have you packed up?

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.340
I'll go pick you up.

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:05.860
It'll be too late.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:06.580
Don't do that.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:08.940
I'll be fine.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.260
No.

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.180
I want to do that.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.540
No way.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.420
Go pack up when you're done.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.620
I don't want to.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.420
Good girl.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:24.780
Go pack up.

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.060
Oh.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.500
Bye.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.140
Bye.

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:46.900
Dad.

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.820
She just fell asleep.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:03.420
Did you talk to her?

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.420
Fanzhou,

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.500
I rushed here

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.780
as soon as I signed the contract.

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:15.980
In the past few days,

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.740
you must've been tired.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.540
You're a good boy.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:24.380
Since you were little,

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.220
you've never let me down.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:28.660
I'm used to that.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:34.460
Fanzhou,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.660
do you think

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.020
that I'm not a good husband?

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:49.300
Oh.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.260
Do you have a girlfriend?

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.380
Yes.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.460
Then

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.980
does she know about your mom's illness?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:01.260
Yes,

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:03.180
but she doesn't mind.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.900
She's a good girl.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:07.420
Cherish her.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:09.300
Hmm.

00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:13.780
But she doesn't know it's hereditary.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.540
I took genetic testing.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.180
What's the result?

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:22.260
I haven't got it.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:25.780
But if anything is wrong,

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.620
I'll break up with her.

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.140
Why?

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.020
Because

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.060
she wouldn't abandon me

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.340
even if she knows I have the disease.

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.460
I'll stay with you
no matter what disease you have.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:46.540
Really.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.740
Isn't that great?

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.140
But I don't want to see her

00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:55.180
become someone like you someday.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.380
You want to run away but you don't dare to.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.780
You want to run away but you can't.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.500
Your love is running out.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.260
Hate is all that's left.

00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:19.260
I don't want her to be like that

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.180
because of me.

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:26.020
I can't do that to her.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:37.980
I'll take the Mihoo facial masks
which are super moisturizing.

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.140
Stop taking that.

00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.220
This.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.140
Put this in.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.580
This is a reward of your dad.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.700
I don't need it.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:47.580
It's available in school.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:49.500
Hands off.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:50.900
It's available in school,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:52.100
but you need to pay for it.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.940
Too much stuff, mom.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.780
No enough room.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.460
There is room here.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.420
Have you packed up?

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:56.980
Dad.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.380
Yes, we have.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:59.180
Go get special local products with my mom.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.380
I need them.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:01.340
I'll take them to school.

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.380
Special local products?

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:04.940
Get some good ones.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.340
She wants to take them to school.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:07.900
For your friends, right?

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:08.460
Right.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:08.940
Okay.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.420
Yasi.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:18.660
Zhou Xiao,

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.740
Yasi got you a watermelon. Come out.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.660
Put it in the fridge.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:22.900
Let him do it.

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:44.460
What are you doing?

00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:47.820
Your fan is broken.

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:49.020
Your dad asked me to get it fixed.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.380
Can you do that?

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:53.900
I major in computer science.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.220
I'm not an electrician.

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:56.540
Then why did you take it apart?

00:43:58.320 --> 00:43:59.080
It's broken anyway.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:43:59.860
Look.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:01.200
I took it apart.

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:02.100
Then I'll reassemble it.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.140
If it works again,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.300
it'll be considered as another wonder.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.980
Enjoy it.

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.290
I'm going to cut this watermelon.
Do you want some?

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.000
No.

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:16.500
There is a pile of watermelons at my home.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.460
I don't know
where my mom got them by wholesale.

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.060
A masterpiece.

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:28.740
A miracle.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.380
Insane.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:32.490
You know nothing.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.100
Do you know how much you ate?

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:41.900
Don't you feel ashamed?

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.220
You said clearly

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:43.980
you didn't want any.

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:45.300
Well.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.700
I just like changing my mind.

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:49.510
It's gross.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:58.860
You've got a pockmark.

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:01.460
You too.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:05.420
You're seriously sick.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.860
There is one on the back of your head.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.100
Let's see which are more powerful,

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:21.580
watermelon seeds or watermelon peels.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:28.940
Dad. Mom.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.300
Mr. Zhao. Mrs. Zhao.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:35.960
Mrs. Zhao.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.340
Now you see

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:44.420
why I want Fanzhou to be my son-in-law.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.330
I may agree to that.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.060
Mom,

00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:58.580
I'm leaving.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.580
Listen to dad.

00:46:02.530 --> 00:46:03.730
Be cooperative with medical workers.

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.610
I'll come pick you up

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.420
when the registration is done.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.190
Dad, Zhao Fanzhou really came
and picked me up.

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:24.740
I'm telling the truth.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.220
He even rolled out the red carpet.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:27.220
Don't worry.

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:28.360
That's it. Bye.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:31.820
What's up?

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:33.820
Why did you lie to your dad?

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.520
He's prejudiced against Zhao Fanzhou.

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:37.980
I want to earn him some brownie points.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.300
Where is Zhao Fanzhou?

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:40.220
In Beijing.

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.340
A new semester is about to start.
It's an important moment,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.980
but he hasn't been back.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.700
It seems the long distance

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:49.940
may kill your relationship.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.620
Cracks have appeared, right?

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.540
Sorry to let you down.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.900
I'll go meet him at the airport
after cleaning up.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:59.180
Those who're in a relationship

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:00.260
keep picking each other up.

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.060
It's a waste of traffic resource.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.580
Green your commute. Got it?

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:05.780
You should be forbidden

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.540
to pick each other up.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.140
In this case, a lot of resource will be...

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:09.620
Hey.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.150
I haven't finished.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:12.980
What's the big deal
of being in a relationship?

00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:16.060
You still have to be polite.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.390
Zhao Fanzhou!

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:35.700
Watch out!

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:45.700
(Next Episode)

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.980
I just put a spell on you.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.060
To stop you getting mad at me.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:50.620
A fairy is spreading flowers!

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:55.420
I think we need to break up.
