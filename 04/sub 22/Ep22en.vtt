Older sister Lingyin is here.

33
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.350
-Older sister Lingyin.
-Older sister Lingyin.

34
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.860
- Older sister Lingyin. Where are the reinforcements?

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000
Did Sir not send anyone over to help us?

36
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.340
I am no longer an advisor.

37
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.500
He won't help us.

38
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.230
Older sister Lingyin, why are you so stupid?

39
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.200
Why must you do what the letter tells you to?

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.740
Then does he not believe us?

41
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.290
It's not that.

42
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.650
It's me who doesn't know how.

43
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.270
Older sister Lingyin, don't be sad.

44
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.230
I took out all the cash we have from the bookshop.

45
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.860
There are only

46
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.880
200 taels of silver

47
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.760
We are short of 1800 taels

48
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.300
Wait, who's that?

49
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.470
Here is the "1800 taels"

50
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.930
What's wrong with you guys?

51
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.230
You two, you two.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.160
I-I am just passing by.

53
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.800
I am really just passing by. I don't want to come in.

If things go well,

57
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.170
I will go back with you immediately and get married to you.

58
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.890
No.

59
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.850

60
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.610
Tell me! Who bullied my Miss?

61
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.060
Qingchen was kidnapped.

62
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.500
Her brother got kidnapped?

63
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.730
Her brother got kidnapped?

64
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.990
This big of problem and you didn't tell me earlier?

65
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.160
How did you two watch him?

66
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.740
Where is he?

67
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.100
They're asking us for ransom money.

68
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.790
But we only have 200 taels.

69
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.130
200 taels!

70
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.660
Is it not enough?

71
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.170
Need 1800 taels in addition

72
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:36.930
Need 1800 taels...

73
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.030
Miss.

74
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.240
Remember.

75
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.090
As long as I am here,

76
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.900
I will protect you and your brother.

77
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.620
You two make her happy.

78
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.930
The money will arrive shortly.

79
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.340
Let's go make some money.

80

<i>[Tongling County Office] </i>

81
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.900
There's no way Advisor is a spy. How could she keep it a secret from us for that long?

82
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.220
Our ritual officer is taking money from people.

83
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.220
Do you know this?

84
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.030
Each student scholar need to pay 8 qian.

85
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.740
The person who cannot afford cannot take the course.

86
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.270
Go quickly and teach him a lesson.

87
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.060
No need to injure any tendons or bones.

88
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.020
But we cannot lack bruises.

89
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.790
I am having a serious conversation with you. What are you doing?

90
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.680
In my precinct,

91
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.760
student scholars don't even have a school to go to. Doesn't this count as a serious matter?

92
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.570
Yes, yes, yes. It does count as a serious matter.

93
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.770
I'll go and whip that old money-hungry bastard in a bit.

94
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.510
What's important right now is Advisor Tan.

95
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.410
Do you really believe what she said?

96
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.200
She really tried hard not to blink.

97
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.840
She pinched herself so hard that it was red.

98
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.980
Doesn't it just prove that shes lying?

99
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.240
I don't know what this idiot is thinking.

100
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.150
I have my own reasons.

101
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.560
The ritual officer lives next to Gutao bookstore.

102
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:13.360
You can take care of these two.

103
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.500
Then what about you?

104
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.040
You hate to part with her right?

105
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.550
For you, I'm going to help persuade her to stay.


107
00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.670
Why are you still not killing me?

108
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.630
Don't worry.

109
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.790
Wait for your older sister.

110
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.060
So that both of you guys can die together.

111
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.980
The money is already given to them.

112
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.600
Why aren't they here yet?

113
00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.640
There's not even a boat here. How are we supposed to give it to them?

114
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.070
He's here.

115
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.270
You left me to ask him for help?

116
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.250
Can't you show some promise?

117
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.690
What! Why can't she look for me?

118
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.190
I already found the person who's suppose to collect the money.

119
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.400
-How did you know my younger brother got kidnapped?
-Yeah.

120
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.720
Hey, don't stay silent.

121
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.880
What if they escape?

122
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.770
You have the money,

123
00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.490
but what about the younger brother?

124
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.420
-Tang Feilong, explain it to us clearly.
-Sir.

125
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.250
-Are you going to talk or not?
-Talk!

126
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.930
-I will talk.
-Then talk!

127
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.750
I am innocent.

128
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.110
A woman said...Said for me to stand there and wait.

129
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.640
She said if I stay till afternoon, she'll give me 100 silver taels.

130
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:56.270
I really don't know anything else.

131
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.730
You are innocent? Not even a ghost would believe that!

132
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.850
- He is drawing out time. 
 - He is definitely drawing out time. Hit him.

133
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.170
Advisor, don't worry! Sir went to look for him.

134
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:15.240
- Where did Sir Tang go to look for him? 
 - He ordered us to search the entire county.

135
00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.740
Even if we have to dig three feet underground, we will still find him.

136
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.970
He also said you should stay at the County Office.

137
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:24.600
This person's aim isn't pure. It may be a plan to lure us out.

138
00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.320
Their motive is you.

139
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.770
Young Lord Tan! Young Lord Tan!

140
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:37.040
Where are you, Young Lord Tan!

141
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.640
Sir. We looked everywhere.

142
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:41.470
We couldn't find the Advisor's brother.

143
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.380
Are we planning on going up Mount Tianmu to find them?

144
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.940
Are you not familiar with the topography of Mount Tianmu?

145
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.000
Even if we search the entire mountain, we might not be able to find him.

146
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.580
Young Lord Tan! Young Lord Tan!

147
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.100
I already notified Duan Feng. They're searching Mount Tianmu too.

148
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.470
Once they find anything they will tell us.

149
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.280
Young Lord Tan! Can you hear us?

150
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.250
There is a child there.

151
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.020
Slowly.

152
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.120
Are you guys here to catch ghosts?

153
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.150
Catch ghosts? What kind of ghost?

154
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.290
Everyone say there are lots of ghosts on Mount Tianmu.

155
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.820
At night, it will come down to eat humans.

156
00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:23.370
Last night there were a lot of sounds. In the house, it was banging on the walls.

157
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.240
What house?

158
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.290
That one!

159
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.830
In that house, an old man has died there. So no one ever dares to live there.

160
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.790
Everyone says that old man is back.

161
00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.360
That's why there's such a commotion.

162
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:43.030
-Do you want me to go with you? 
- I will go myself. I owe her an explanation.

163
00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.310
What kind of look is that? So full of dislike.

164
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.540
In any case I'm here to save you.

165
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:04.620
You don't need to save me.

166
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.160
Do you want to die? You have to ask your sister first.

167
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.140
I told you not to touch me.

168
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.970
She's not my biological sister.

169
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.200
- My biological sister—
 - Was the empress at that time.

170
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.720
How do you know?

171
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.150
People from the royal palace are on their way to save you.

172
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.990
If I give them a dead body, that is really rude.

173
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.450
I will only bring them endless danger if I live.

174
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.640
I don't want to bother them anymore.

175
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.120
Jiang Rendong.

176
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.740
Do you know that name?

177
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.570
The son of Jiang Shilang, Jiang Rendong.

178
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.980
He fell and died whilst playing polo.

179
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.450
His father was deeply affected by this. He became like a walking corpse.

180
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.610
Even though he appears to have duties in the court, this old man...

181
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.410
He was no longer anyone important.

182
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.620
The son who had high hopes placed on him

183
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.400
not only was he unable to inherit his legacy,

184
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.600
but plotted to seize the throne instead.

185
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.460
Have they been chasing and trying to kill you ever since you were young?

186
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.160
That's right.

187
00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.810
Then this time...

188
00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.010
It is your fiance.

189
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:14.180
Where is she?

190
00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.850
I'm not too sure either.

191
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.940
They made me unconscious.

192
00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:20.500
Then just disappeared.

193
00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.300
Can you recall what else she said?

194
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.760
She also said to wait for my sister.

195
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.860
That we will die together.

196
00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.470
They definitely will have some other trick up their sleeve, we have to leave now.

197
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.600
Be careful!

198
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:52.120
- Darn! What is this? 
 - I have an idea.

199
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:02.890
Brother-In-Law, are you here to save me or put me in more danger?

200
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.090
It's typical to see a hero rescuing a damsel. But a hero saving a brother-in-law.

201
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.760
Are you touched?

202
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.670
Don't come over here!

203
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:15.160
Hurry up and come down! It's dangerous there.

204
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.320
-Yes! 
- Lord Tang will save your brother, you have to believe him.

205
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.180
My brother is my life, so I need to go save him!

206
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.670
Yes. Yes. Yes! Just come down.

207
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.790
Just come down and tell us.

208
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.780
Don't worry, I won't do anything stupid.

209
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.190
Okay.

210
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:35.810
You were right! A bastard will be punished sooner or later.

211
00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:39.410
Who knows, they might be queuing up at the gates of hell to register their names!

212
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:41.050
What do you mean?

213
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.110
It was all to save your brother. He was trapped in a moment of emergency.

214
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.460
He almost lost his life.

215
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.410
Then why are you here?

216
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:51.110
I came back as reinforcement.

217
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:59.020
- Wife! 
 - Be careful, Advisor!

218
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:07.120
The candle is about to break the string. What should we do?

219
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.950
Qingchen, look above us.

220
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:16.330
Move.

221
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.740
Move?

222
00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.460
Hurry.

223
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.630
Hold on tight!

224
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.830
Hurry!

225
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.790
You still have time to drink tea? Their life is hanging by a thin line.

226
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.440
Don't panic. I have my own plans.

227
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.750
Not panic? What plans do you have?

228
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.820
Why are you pretending to be Tang Tianyuan? Do you have his brains?

229
00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:58.500
It seems like your impression of Master Tang has changed recently.

230
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.910
Have you thought everything through?

231
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.540
Are you going to save them? If not, I will go myself.

232
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.840
Stop!

233
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.460
Master Tang has a plan. He thought of a back-up plan ages ago.

234
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.260
There's no danger in Advisor Tan going.

235
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.800
Also, this is such a good chance for them to make up.

236
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.550
Don't mess things up.

237
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.940
I-

238
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.920
Come on!

239
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.590
How are you guys?

240
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:39.310
Are you guys okay?

241
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:43.430
Are you okay? Qing Chen, does it hurt?

242
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.500
I'm okay, Sister.

243
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.890
Why are you here? Where is Zheng Shaofeng?

244
00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.750
Don't listen to him. Are you okay?

245
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.790
You're not mad anymore?

246
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.390
What are you talking about?

247
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.170
In the public court I was put in a disadvantageous position.

248
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.710
So everything I said was a lie.

249
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.510
I thought you were pretty authentic.

250
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.510
You are right.

251
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.760
I did doubt your ability.

252
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.030
So you just left like that?

253
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.800
What do you mean just leaving like that?

254
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.100
As a magistrate can't you speak properly?

255
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:22.830
Pot calling the kettle black. I've been led astray by you.

256
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.940
Actually I thought about it later on.

257
00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.200
But you know me, it's so easy for me to be rash.

258
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.040
Zong Yinglin took advantage of this weakness.

259
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.100
I won't lie to you anymore.

260
00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.370
You are a liar. You even lied and

261
00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.770
said you are Tang Feilong.

262
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.100
I really won't this time.

263
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.250
I promise you, if I lie then I will-

264
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.770
-Sister. 
- Qing Chen.

265
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.860
Are you okay?

266
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.180
I am fine. Sister,

267
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.240
are you here to save me or him?

268
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.550
Of course, it's you. Silly brother.

269
00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.840
I will protect you well from now on.

270
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.500
If Master Tang wasn't here today then you would be dead.

271
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.320
Sister, I'm sorry for worrying you.

272
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:25.430
As long as you are fine.

273
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.260
Duan Feng?

274
00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.390
Brother are you okay?

275
00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:32.350
All thanks to Lord Tang.

276
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.860
I searched the whole mountain, and I don't even get a word of thanks?

277
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.570
Aren't we good friends? Treating me as if I was a stranger.

278
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:40.980
But thank you.

279
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.750
Look at him. Always so reasonable.

280
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.840
The brother is found.

281
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.340
There's not much left for you to do here, right?

282
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.300
Look at your cold and ruthless manner.

283
00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.050
Okay. I will leave.

284
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.860
I will contact Old Tie myself.

285
00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:02.940
Wait!

286
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.580
You went to look for Old Tie?

287
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:06.520
Of course.

288
00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.280
And then?

289
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.420
Let's not tell her.

290
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.610
Tell me!

291
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.760
Later at the <i>Shen</i> hour we're meeting in front of the mountain village.

292
00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.890
I will go with you.

293
00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:21.150
I also want to go.

294
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.880
Listen to me, go back to the County Office.

295
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.980
Your brother has something to tell you.

296
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:26.340
Let's talk about it later.

297
00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.640
Once we get back to the County Office I will ask Zheng Shaofeng to bring troops to pick me up.

298
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.500
Then stay safe.

299
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.180
It's okay. I will come back safely.

300
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.950
Don't worry, without him there's still me.

301
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.760
Stop saying nonsense.

302
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:51.220
Don't worry.

303
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:56.140
I will be safe.

304
00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.190
-We are leaving. 
- Duan Feng, take care of Lord Tang for me.

305
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:01.970
Let's go.

306
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:25.370
Are you crazy?

307
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.240
Who told you to kidnap Tang Qing Chen?

308
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:30.710
That will reveal us!

309
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.400
Isn't there a saying that men are fickle?

310
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.290
But why did he still come for her?

311
00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:43.140
Those two have long been embarrassing together.

312
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:52.210
Why can't he ever see my existence?

313
00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:58.440
Tang Tianyuan this person is too cruel.

314
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.310
Maybe I should have listened to you earlier and kill him based on our plan.

315
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:06.760
Should have pushed him off Tianmu Mountain so he dies without a grave!

316
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:14.210
I've already intercepted his letter to the Emperor asking for his help.

317
00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.080
My father has also stopped all the news regarding Tongling from getting out.

318
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.150
But you...

319
00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.860
When will you

320
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.300
give us the hidden things?

321
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:35.360
N..No No. Miss Jiang.

322
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.230
You also know him,

323
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.730
I have an agreement with Lord Jiang.

324
00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.880
Look for the gold and hand over the key.

325
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.760
In an agreement, as gentlemen we cannot go back on our word.

326
00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.910
We can't go against it.

327
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:54.870
Qing Chen. Did you see who kidnapped you?

328
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.330
Why aren't you talking?

329
00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.500
Didn't Lord Tang say you have something to tell me?

330
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:07.170
Sister. I found my family.

331
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:15.520
They are from the Capital. They sent me a letter.

332
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.340
They asked me to go back and reunite with them.

333
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.660
Why so suddenly?

334
00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.830
Is it your biological parents?

335
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.980
Are they tricking you?

336
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:31.960
Lord Tang found them, so it should be real.

337
00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.380
Didn't he say he wouldn't lie to me? Why didn't he tell me this?

338
00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.310
Sister, if you aren't happy then I won't go.

339
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:42.950
Anyway, I've not seen them in so many years. Haven't I already been living well?

340
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.390
Let's not talk about that.

341
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.800
Why did they abandon you?

342
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.330
Since they already abandoned,

343
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.540
why are they now looking for you.

344
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.620
Constable Zheng. What are you doing in the assistant's room?

345
00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.290
Not much, I was just concerned about his daily needs.

346
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.410
I want to see if there is anything we need to replace.

347
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.080
The Assistant? He is a big man.

348
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:41.880
What do you need to care about?

349
00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.310
If we want to care, we should care more about-

350
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.550
We are leaving!

351
00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:00.570
So... your biological sister is?

352
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:02.290
The queen.

353
00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.590
Then what about me?

354
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:09.670
You are my sister.

355
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.510
Qing Chen.

356
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:26.930
Since you already found your biological sister, why didn't you tell me?

357
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.890
Are you scared of me preventing you from going back to your real family?

358
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.890
Once I leave what will happen to you?

359
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:38.740
Your cooking is awful, you can't clean clothes properly, you can't count your accounts clearly.

360
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.950
Stop talking!

361
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.820
You make it sound like I'm completely useless!

362
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:53.130
Your elder sister has been looking for you for 10 years,

363
00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:56.460
according to reason, you should pay your respects to her.

364
00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:01.220
But..But what about you?

365
00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.880
What about me?

366
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.870
Now that you have your empress older sister, you'll forget about Miaomiao Sheng?

367
00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:07.320
Of course not!

368
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.270
Then isn't that fine?

369
00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.900
I can't believe,

370
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.580
I have a relative who is related to royalty.

371
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.390
When you go back, take good care of yourself.

372
00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.100
When you have time come and visit me and mom.

373
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.420
Also our bookstore.

374
00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:44.100
Oh yeah.

375
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.620
Didn't you say

376
00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.950
it was because when you were younger you heard the wild ambitions of Jiang Shilang.

377
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.600
So they wanted to kill you?

378
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:58.320
Then who kidnapped you this time?

379
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.710
It was Jiang Shilang's daughter, Jiang Muchun.

380
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.420
What?

381
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.390
Oh no!

382
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.170
I will tell you later!

383
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.490
I helped you so many times, how are you going to thank me?

384
00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.120
As a professional bandit,

385
00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.460
for you to be able to meet me and help me with tasks, it is your honour.

386
00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.690
If you don't speak properly, I will switch allegiance to Lao Tie.

387
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.240
Anyway the words of bandits can never be trusted.

388
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.840
After this incident I'll definitely put in a good word for you.

389
00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.960
All your previous crimes can be forgotten.

390
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.540
Just like that?

391
00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:41.530
Sir! Sir!

392
00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.240
It's too late, this is a trap! Hurry and go back to the County Office!

393
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.060
Xiao Feilong, be careful!

394
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.560
Sir!

395
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.990
-Hurry up and leave! 
-Let's go.

396
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.130
Duan Feng, help me!

397
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.260
Be careful!

398
00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.340
We will leave first, you guys stay safe.

399
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.210
Hug me tightly.

400
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.770
Go!

401
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.050
<i>[Tongling County Office] </i>

402
00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.010
Sir! Sir!

403
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.460
Sir!

404
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.930
<i>Come someone! Bring bandages and medicine!</i>

405
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.180
Sir! Sir!

406
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.980
- I will go get the doctor. 
-Hurry up!

407
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.380
Tan Lingyin, you severely injured Sir Tang.

408
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:27.340
From now on you are not allowed to come here!

409
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.340
What do you mean?

410
00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:36.980
Are all of you deaf? Dawang, Xiao Liu, do you still see yourselves as people of the magistrate?

411
00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:40.070
Jiang Muchun, is this the right time to say these things?

412
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.740
Take her out!

413
00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.900
But...But.

414
00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:46.820
I am the Lord's fiance.

415
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:49.610
Are you going to listen to her or me?

416
00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.030
Cong Shun.

417
00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:00.610
How about you?

418
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.200
No need. I will leave myself.

419
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.300
-Take good care of him. 
-Please.

420
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:08.710
Hurry!

421
00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.000
-This way.
-Hurry!

422
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.300
Sir!

423
00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.800
Why are you holding a sword?

424
00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:41.870
To protect myself.

425
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:46.000
I'm the only one here so it's unnecessary.

426
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
We're brothers yet you sent someone to ambush and kill me on the way here.

427
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.200
What a good brother.

428
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.100
What are you talking about?

429
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.000
I am so disappointed in you.

430
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.400
I'll be honest with you. If the county magistrate couldn't get the money,

431
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.400
You shouldn't even think about it either.

432
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.400
So?

433
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:10.300
Are you here to show off?

434
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.400
I am the only one who knows where the gold is.

435
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.200
I've also contacted the one in charge of the county.

436
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.100
They will kill all of you guys.

437
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.600
When you guys are all dead,

438
00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.000
the gold is all mine!

439
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.800
We're talking. Why are you trying to kill me?

440
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.400
If you die, it's because you had conflict with Tang Feilong.

441
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.600
If you don't die,

442
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.800
it's also because you and Tang Feilong had conflict over splitting the gold.

443
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.600
You suddenly had a desire to kill and decided to hurt him on the way to the mountain.

444
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.000
<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

445
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.800
Xue Li, is Lord Tang inside?

446
00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.600
He is.

447
00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.100
What's wrong?

448
00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:24.000
Xue Li.

449
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.800
You can go in first.

450
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.800
What's wrong?

451
00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.500
Sir has good fortune. He's okay.

452
00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.400
Then why are you both like that?

453
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.220
How did the Lord get hurt? Was it because of Advisor Tan?

454
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.800
Swords don't have eyes. We don't really know...

455
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.600
It's like this already! If it is her, just say so. I won't eat her.

456
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.000
Even though Sir Tang said ruthless words in court that day,

457
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.400
Advisor Tan would never hurt him over that.

458
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.200
Of course not!

459
00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.800
But... what do you mean by that?

460
00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:15.700
Miss Jiang said Advisor Tan turned her love into hate,

461
00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.000
choose Duan Feng, and hurt Sir Tang.

462
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.200
She's not allowed to come to the county office.

463
00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.600
Miss Jiang said you can go in to see the Lord.

464
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.000
Forget it. Tell him to wait.

465
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.600
Keep him alive. When I come back, we're going to drink for three days and three nights!

466
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:53.200
Advisor. Be careful!

467
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.400
If you get hurt, then I will have a hard time explaining to the Lord.

468
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.700
I don't need you to explain it to him. I can tell him myself.

469
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.700
The Lord is still unconscious right now.

470
00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.000
You're not a medical professional so you can't save him.

471
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.800
You can't say anything intimate to him right now. Please leave.

472
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.900
How did I do to bother you?

473
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.300
You already kidnapped my brother and almost killed Lord Tang.

474
00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.700
Even if you hate me, do you really need to commit murder?

475
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.500
Stop saying nonsense!

476
00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.000
No.

477
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.200
The Lord told me you aren't the Advisor anymore.

478
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:41.200
If you want to talk about how love turns into hate,

479
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.800
aren't you more fitting than me?

480
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.800
Didn't you plan on up to the mountain with that bandit?

481
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:50.700
I know what you are trying to do.

482
00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.000
You want me to bring Duan Feng down here as a witness.

483
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.600
So that you can kill him easily.

484
00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.700
Then do it! You can try it out and see if it actually like that.

485
00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.000
Don't get too happy too soon!

486
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.500
Once Sir Tang wakes up, he'll lock you up!

487
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.300
Let's wait until he actually wakes up.

488
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.800
This bailiff sure worries me. Why didn't he stop you?

489
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.700
Xi Hulu, go ask who was on duty in jail today.

490
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.690
You don't need you to tell me to leave. I'll leave by myself!

491
00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.900
Where is the Advisor?

492
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.620
I don't know. She came back hurriedly

493
00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:49.800
and said stuff we didn't understand.

494
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.300
Then she left in a hurry.

495
00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:56.200
Did she say how she knew there was a trap?

496
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.400
Also, did she mention anyone?

497
00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.300
No.

498
00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.600
She was just anxiously pacing around the house.

499
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.700
She said something like "If I don't get revenge, I'll write my name upside-down."

500
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.000
Then do you know where she went?

501
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.600
I'm not too sure.

502
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.300
Sister Linying also said she had to see

503
00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:17.100
how much skill this devious woman has.

504
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.000
She doesn't leave a trace!

505
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.500
A devious woman...

506
00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.100
Then can it be her?

507
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.400
Whatever for now. I'll going to look around in Mount Tianmu.

508
00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:35.360
Notify me immediately if she comes back.

509
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.700
Don't let her leave the county office. Okay?

510
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.100

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:02.000

513
00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.360
Head Constable Zheng?

514
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.800
Young Master Zhu.

515
00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.700
Where is Lord Tang?

516
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.500
He's here. But you can't see him.

517
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500
What do you mean?

518
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:22.100
He's been attacked. He's about to die.

519
00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.800
Your chance is here again.

520
00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:30.890
Whatever. I won't make jokes anymore. Sir Tang is fine.

521
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.800
Oh. Head Constable Zheng. I...

522
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.200
I'm here to resign.
