Sunbae,

6
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.380
we should really end things between us now.

7
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.020
Even though so much time has passed,

8
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.060
the fact that we still regret and long for each other

9
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.340
I think it's because we never properly broke up.

10
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.900
So, a real breakup.

11

Let's have a perfect goodbye.

12
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.550
I can't do that, Ji Soo.

I want to protect you.

14
00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.400
It's not because I feel guilty,

15
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.190
and it's not because of regret or some sort of hope.

16
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.840
And it's not that I wished to have protected you.

17
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.730
I want to protect you.

18
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.040
And because of this one thing...

19
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.500
Like you did in the past.

20
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.020

We've only just taken one step. We can't end things now.

I know why you made the choice that you made.

23
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.800
You made that choice because of me, so I'm going to make it right.

24
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.390
You were holding me hostage without me even realizing it.

25
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.110
You should have been more careful if you were going to do greater things.

26
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.010
You know what kind of world we live in.

27

You're going to need to stop what you're doing.

A long time ago, Jae Hyeon

36
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.260
said he had lost something.

37
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.640
He had really sad eyes.

38
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.710
That something is you, Yoon Ji Soo, right?

39
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.960
It must be true if you're not denying it.

40
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.300
I'm curious.

41
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.620
Why did you guys break up when you loved each other so much?

42
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.220
You guys are taking turns making fools out of us.

43
00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.980
It's as if you guys planned this, saying you'll give yourselves up for each other.

44
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.570
If you loved each other so terribly, why did you break up?

I've told you my intentions, so I'll excuse myself now.

46
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.440
I left him.

47
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.150
Can I ask why you did that?

48
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.420
My life crumbled to pieces in an instant.

49
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.360
My anger and despair was so intense and on edge

50
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.270
that I felt like I would hurt him, too.

51
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.840
I'm not too sure, but if it was that hard, couldn't you share your suffering with him?

52
00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:03.020
If I shared my suffering, instead of the suffering becoming less,

53
00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.590
we would have both become monsters.

I started cooking for myself since middle school

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.740
because my Mom and Dad were both at work.

You had to be mature at an early age.

Kids who are alone tend to mature quicker.

98
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.320
It makes me feel kind of bad, but

She told me to throw them away.

163

I'll throw them out myself.

Do you think I can find a cassette tape player for these?

166
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.050
I'm sure a quick internet search will work. The 90's trends are quite popular these days.

167
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:39.360
Can you find one for me?

Yes, I'll do that.

It's... not a place, but a website.

172

A website where you can watch music shows from the 90's and relive nostalgic times.

173
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.830
Hey, you're dissing me, aren't you?

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:00.160
No, not at all. How could I?

175

He's just a really cool guy.

192
00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:38.260
They gave one to everyone at school. I want to grow it at home.

193
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.770
What about we grow it somewhere bigger?

194
00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.780
If it's stuck in the pot, it can't extend its roots.

Sounds good.

It would've been nice if you could live in a bigger house, right?

197
00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.620
Like the house you went to see with Dad.

198
00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.800
Are we really going to live with Dad?

199
00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:15.940
Yeong Min, can you forgive me just this once?

200
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.820
I did something bad.

201
00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:24.190
I told you we would go live with Dad without even asking for your opinion,

202
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.830
and then I went back on my words, saying I couldn't.

203
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.500
So we're not living with him?

204
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.130
- I'll forgive you. 
 - Is that really okay?

205
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.150
I think not living together is a bit better anyway.

206
00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.660
Why?

207
00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:45.510
It's something you don't like. That's why you split up.

208
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:50.960
That's why you said to live together, and then decided you couldn't.

209
00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:56.870
I know you're in middle school now, but aren't you still being too reasonable about this?

210
00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:01.760
Actually, it's an emotional response. I felt scared and uncomfortable, too.

Of course!

219

My brother, who is so terribly unlucky.

221
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:40.050
Mathilda's last line was so sad.

222
00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.520
What was that again?

223
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.530
She replants their plant in the park, and says

224
00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.660
"We will be okay here, Leon."

225

- That's listening, not speaking. 
 - Forget it.

228
00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:01.340
On that note, shall we draw inspiration from our brother Leon

229
00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.640
and drink not milk, but makgeolli which is similar? 
 ( Korean rice wine )

230

You said you would leave after watching the movie.

231

Am I a plane? Why do you keep telling me to take off?

232
00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.770
You think that's funny? What a horrible joke.

233

There's something that I want.

234
00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.650
Hey, let's go drink makgeolli! What is there to buy?

235
00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.150
What is it?

236
00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.600
Leon.

237
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:35.000
You can't become Mathilda just because you're holding a plant.

238
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.100
Someone as pretty as her might show up only once in 100 years.

239
00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.830
Ji Soo is way prettier.

Of course I would. Totally.

This is a bit of a special place.

244
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:12.890
What's special about it?

245
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.220
God is here, Mary is here,

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.470
and a lot of priests and believers as well.

247
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:24.790

My love life is like yours because I take after you.

273
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:15.500
Mom, who never smiled in front of you,

274
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:20.940
smiled once at that amusement park.

275

Just like Mom, the ice-cold Jae Hyeon

told that woman he can leave everything and go to her.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.640
That woman?

279
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:48.790
He must have smiled for her.

What about Seo Kyeong?

She said she doesn't want breakfast because she drank a lot yesterday.

284
00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.740
Can we talk?

285
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:23.650
I've said everything I wanted to say.

286
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.470
I can't act like everything's okay when I did something wrong.

287
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:32.550
The video won't get released,

288
00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:35.750
so you won't have to be responsible for that woman.

289
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.100
Nothing changes.

290
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.810
Leave now. I feel nauseous.

291
00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:52.730
You were assigned to the distribution center?

292
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.200
Yeah.

293
00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:56.810
Isn't it tiring?

294
00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:02.310
It is tiring. I went from being a cashier to heavy lifting at the distribution center.

295
00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.110
Is this like a retaliation assignment?

296
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.800
Probably.

297
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:11.130
At least, I like that I was able to apply to the labor union because I became a full-time employee.

298
00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:12.530
That's a relief.

299
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:16.660
How about you? Are you doing well?

300
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:19.440
I'm doing really well.

301
00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.420
Still busy?

302
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:25.020
It's harder for people like us if we're not busy.

303
00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.860
That's true.

304
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.210
Would it be alright for me to ask you a favor?

305
00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:38.510
I'm part of the cultural department of our labor union and we're holding a cultural festival,

306
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.250
but we don't have anyone to play the keyboard.

307
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:45.540
So I thought of you.

308
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.220
Is it okay even if I'm not a member of the union?

309
00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:50.150
Yes, it's fine. We often recruit from outside.

310
00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.990
-I'll do it. 
 -But it won't pay much.

311
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:55.300
You don't need to pay me.

312
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.070
That's not okay!

313
00:34:57.070 --> 00:35:00.020
I've always wanted to donate my skills.

314
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.380
Did you want me to buy you some more food?

315
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.610
Prosecution investigation officers are in the lobby with a warrant for a second search and seizure.

316
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.050
They also have a summons for you, Vice President.

317
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:22.220
It seemed really intense. Is something going wrong?

318
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.860
If they want me to go, I'll go. Diligently and sincerely.

319
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:28.360
I'm more nervous because you're so calm. What will you do if they put you in jail again?

320
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:32.130
Stop overreacting and make the appropriate preparations.

321
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:35.670
The real game starts now.

322
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.910
<i>Hyung Sung Group Labor Union Cultural Festival</i>

323
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.550
What is this sound?

324
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:55.630
They're holding a labor union cultural festival right outside.

325
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:58.260
They're really trying to get on the chairman's nerves...

326
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:16.010
♫<i>Let's live like a rock</i>♫

328

329
00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.990

330
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:41.460
♫<i>What sways in the wind are reeds with thin roots </i>♫

331
00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.590
What are they going on about now?

332
00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.230
Can't you call the police to take them all away?

333
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.120
They got approval from the ward office.

334
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.140
- But Yoon Ji Soo is there, Chairman. 
 - Who?

335
00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:56.320
The Vice President's woman you told me to look into.

336
00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.900
Oh, why is that woman there?

337
00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.710
I'll look into it.

338
00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:00.860
Which one? Where?

339
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.740
The one playing the keyboard.

340
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.700
She doesn't look ordinary even from far away.

341
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:18.090
♫<i>Call me when you need someone

<i>Thirtieth Floor</i>

346
00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.840
Vice President, I need to go to the twentieth floor, not the thirtieth...

347
00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.990
Oh, I'm going to the thirtieth floor. With you, Department Manager.

348
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.660
I noticed you taking pictures of the labor union festival.

349
00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:11.400
Yes. The chairman wanted to see them.

350
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:15.450
Can I see them, too? I need to know which employees are taking part in the labor union.

351
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.050
I'll send it to you by email.

352
00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.430
I would have to see it now.

353
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.900
Department Manager?

354
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.680
<i>Delete</i>

355
00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:52.220
<i>Deleting</i>

356
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.140
Ji Soo.

357
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.500
You don't have to avoid me. I came for work related reasons today.

358
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:17.860
As a member of the board, I want to ask you not to take part in events like today.

359
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:25.400
I'm not an employee, but even if I was, you can't tell me that as a member of the board.

360
00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:28.250
Why are you there when you aren't even an employee?

361
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:32.950
I did it as a favor for my previous coworkers and I enjoyed it.

362
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.240
I always felt bad because I felt like I ran away by myself like a coward.

363
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:41.320
Like I wanted a better world for free.

364
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.970
This isn't much, but at least I'm paying something.

365
00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:52.310
On top of that, it's the thing I can do best.

366
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.700
Instead of being a keyboard warrior that blabbers online with their fingers,

367
00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.470
I'm going to be a real keyboard warrior, fighting with piano keys.

368
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:02.860
You said you're busy making a living, how are you going to be a warrior on top of that?

369
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.850
I'm only able to do this much because I'm busy making a living.

370
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.140
And I'm ashamed of it, too.

371
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.150
So you're still there?

372
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.030
Because there are still people there.

373
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.030
So it wasn't that people weren't there...

374
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.890
I just turned a blind eye.

375
00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.390
How is school, Joon Seo? Is it fun?

376
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:46.940
Well, it's just, whatever.

377
00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.490
It's no fun?

378
00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:50.440
It's just a bit annoying.

379
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:52.570
Why? Is something wrong?

380
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:57.110
The facilities are the best, and the teachers have been hired among the best, too. What's the problem?

381
00:40:57.110 --> 00:41:01.690
Grandpa, didn't you know? Some jerk threw a chair at me.

382
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:11.920
How could you hide something so grave from me?

383
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.470
I'm sorry, Chairman.

384
00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.660
It's not even like he hit someone. He got hit.

385
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:20.000
At the time, I tried to make things widely public and punish them properly,

386
00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.360
but Joon Seo's parents came and said they would be generous and let things go quietly.

387
00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.660
Seo Kyeong said that?

388
00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.280
His mother wasn't willing to compromise,

389
00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.860
but his father said this could absolutely not go to the school violence committee.

390
00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:50.420
<i> Murderer Company

391
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.830
<i>Love Letter</i>

392
00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.010
Hello?

393
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:28.880
<i>Hello, I'm Hyeon Woo's mom. </i>

394
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.450
<i>Are you coming to parent's observation day at school tomorrow?</i>

395
00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:38.280
I do want to go, but I'm a bit uncomfortable about something.

396
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.320
I think Joon Seo's dad met with her because he's so soft-hearted.

397
00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.040
He had no other choice to be kind to her, since she was begging him, and she was his junior in college.

398
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.540
Oh my goodness. How could something like that...?

399
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:54.610
It's embarrassing, but I am telling you because I was frustrated.

400
00:42:54.610 --> 00:42:57.730
I'm glad you told me.

401
00:42:57.730 --> 00:43:02.100
I'm not much myself, but I am looking over the other moms.

402
00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.380
This is truly a worst-case scenario.

403
00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:08.310
My face is flushed.

404
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:14.120
Anyway, I don't think I'll be able to go. I don't feel comfortable to see Yeong Min's mom.

405
00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:16.280
How can you say such thing?

406
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:21.060
Why do you have to avoid her? She's the one that did wrong.

407
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.830
I'll take care of it.

408
00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:27.180
I can't ever forgive these type of things.

409
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:31.550
If rumors gets out, the school's image will falter, too.

410
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.620
You're getting another prosecutorial investigation?

411
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.800
What if you end up eating rice with beans in prison again?

412
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.770
Are you some kind of brand ambassador for rice with beans?

413
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:47.170
This is something I'd anticipated ever since I envisioned my plans. That I could go to prison again.

414
00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:50.630
At the time, I wasn't afraid of going to prison at all.

415
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.200
It's only difficult going the first time.

416
00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.970
Right now, I'm afraid.

417
00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.630
What is it this time?

418
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.810
I'm scared Ji Soo will disappear.

419
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:04.050
That again, she'll have to suffer through something alone while I'm gone.

420
00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:09.390
Is it possible... to face something like that twice in life?

421
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.680
Why are you guys so pitiful?

422
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:18.030
When you guys were together, it made me wonder how you two could even exist,

423
00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.730
because you two were so precious.

424

<i>Open Class Day for Parents Observation</i>

425
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.330
You're here?

426
00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:48.500
I'm glad you came.

427
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.080
- Yeong Min's mother. 
 - Yes?

428
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.260
Do you have some time?

429
00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.880
- Why? 
 - We have some things to discuss.

430
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.560
The other moms are all there already.

431
00:45:19.070 --> 00:45:21.330
Welcome, Yeong Min's mom.

432
00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:37.460
We already ate, but you should order something.

433
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.590
I'm okay.

434
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:42.530
Alright then. We don't have much time anyway, so let's just get it over with.

435
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:47.290
It's not like I don't understand your situation, but there are still things you should and should not do.

436
00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:48.640
I hate beating around the bush.

437
00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.860
Okay, I'll get straight to the point.

438
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.770
How could you make a move on another parent from school?

439
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.020
- She made a move on someone? 
 - She really hit on a parent?

440
00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.240
I heard you used that to stop the school's violence committee.

441
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.940
Sure you may have been desperate, but resolving things like that?

442
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:08.890
It's only a matter of time before the school's image is ruined once rumors start to float around.

443
00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:14.020
If you want to call yourself a mom, you should at least have some dignity.

444
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:17.620
How can you look Yeong Min in the eyes after doing something like that?

445
00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:21.180
He might already know. Kids are quite good at picking up on things.

446
00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:25.800
I heard it's a lie that your husband is a famous lawyer in Gangnam.

447
00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:29.180
You even protested after getting fired from some supermarket.

448
00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.710
How could you trick us all like that, and not offer an ounce of apology?

449
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:37.450
If you have something to say, say it, instead of just sitting there like a mute who ate honey.  
 <i>(T/N: idiom, someone unable to express their thoughts)</i>

450
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.060
I guess you didn't find out about the "red mark" on my family register. 
(T/N: criminal record)

451
00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:47.160
A criminal record for assault causing injury.

452
00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.700
It was at a place just like this. How nostalgic.

453
00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.220
Are you... threatening us right now?

454
00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.060
How dare you say such an abhorrent thing here?

455
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.740
I understand you're trying to act like Jang Seo Kyeong's maid to reap some benefits for yourself,

456
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:03.920
but you picked the wrong target.

457
00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:07.020
Maid? You-

458
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:14.290
Don't bite me. I'll bite you right back.

459
00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:18.870
None of the stories you're making up are true, and if you spread false rumors to your children,

460
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.540
I'll draw another red mark to my name and go to jail again.

461
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.370
Oh my goodness.

462
00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.690
Well, it doesn't seem like she was the only one attacked.

463

<i>Prosecutor's Office</i>

464
00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.330
- Turn off the recording. 
 - Yes.

465
00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:17.020
Today was a bit quieter on your way over, right?

466
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:21.010
You called me so suddenly, there was nobody on the ground floor

467
00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:23.320
yet.

468
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.390
Whenever we ask you to come, we do everything to maintain confidentiality,

469
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:29.280
but this is a place where there's constant talking.

470
00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:33.070
There must be a lot of birds and mice. 
 (Korean phrase meaning there are always people watching and listening)

471
00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.720
Vice President,

472
00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.990
things have become quite complicated.

473
00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:45.240
It'll be difficult to protect you as the anonymous whistleblower.

474
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:54.400
In our country's laws, there are a lot of loopholes around whistleblowers.

475
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.950
The net we're using to catch the fish is big, but so are the mesh of the net itself.

476
00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:01.500
So it will not be easy to catch a large fish.

477
00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:06.220
This is different from what you told me before. So it must not be your idea.

478
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.450
It appears that the fish are still a bit stronger than the net.

479
00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:16.100
So it seems like in order to catch a big fish, we need to get into the water ourselves.

480
00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:20.120
Are you talking about something other than the borrowed-name shares?

481
00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.480
There are more issues to borrowed-name shares than the taxes and shares itself.

482
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.840
As we've told you before, we have been looking into things as well,

483
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:35.330
but there are too many things that have been hidden and buried, and the ocean is as deep as it is wide.

484
00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.360
I'll help you.

485
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.140
Vice President, I'm not someone that sees only what I want to see.

486
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:43.930
I see everything as they exist.

487
00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:47.200
After I've seen it, I move according to the rules.

488
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:53.660
If we go any deeper than this, it'll become more difficult for you as well.

489
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:59.200
It can't be helped. This is something that required my firm resolve from the start.

490
00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.690
You're... quite strong.

491
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:10.890
I have many things to sort out. So let us get started.

492
00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:12.890
Thank you.

493
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:19.180
So these borrowed-name funds...

494
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:20.800
Yes.

495
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.830
- Please say a word!  
 - Do you have a word to share?

496
00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.200
We are ashamed of you!

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.660
Amen.

529
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:18.450
May Christ be with you.

Asylum was trampled.

534
00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:51.620
Asylum?

535
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.390
It's Latin for 'sanctuary.'

536
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:58.900
It's a sanctuary where wrongdoers and runaways cannot be captured.

537
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.150
Although they were all captured today.

538
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:05.600
Then I will become your asylum.

539
00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.380
Come to me at anytime, and I will hide you, so no one can take you away.

540
00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.250
"We will be okay here."

541
00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:25.630
If it's this place, we will be okay.

542
00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.270
You are making good use of that line.

543
00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:47.490
The body of Christ.

544
00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.550
The Leon you planted was still there.

545
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:18.060
Someone kept looking after it I guess.

546
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:24.080
That's fascinating. How can that be?

547
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.300
Actually that's not Leon.

548
00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:32.270
It's not, right? No wonder.

549
00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:36.230
I planted it recently.

550
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:41.510
Deliberately, at this place.

551
00:56:56.390 --> 00:57:01.330
I had forgotten what this place was.

552
00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.990
Because it is an asylum,

553
00:57:09.930 --> 00:57:13.690
where the world's eyes and feet cannot touch...

554
00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.940
So, for just a moment...

555
00:57:38.030 --> 00:57:41.630
I was afraid to be held back by the days of the past if I turned around,

556
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:45.900
so I walked diligently forward, without ever looking back.

557
00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:50.970
But once I stopped, I realized it had always been this place.

558
00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:59.410
Perhaps I walked all those years, to reach this place.

559
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.360
Now, my legs hurt,

560
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.370
so for today, I'll just stay here.

561
00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:14.190
If it's this place,

562
00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.030
we will be okay.
