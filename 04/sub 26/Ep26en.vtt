Rich people just like to destroy things.

36
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.440
This Jiang Muchun, if she was going to destroy the evidence, just destroy the evidence.

37
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.060
Why did she burn this place down?

38
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.920
Your Tang Feilong Detective series

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.600
was also burnt in the fire.

40
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650
Is it sad?

41
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.820
No.

42
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.200
All my memories with you are stored in my head.

43
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.500
Imprinted in my memory. Becoming more resolute with the passing of time.

44
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.590
I still have a lot of time to write graphic novels.

45
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.700
Your sayings are nice.

46
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.600
Then don't use the name Tang Feilong in the future.

47
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630
This generous.

48
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.260
-Do I need to pay to use your name?
-No.

49
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.630
After all, you're be using my last name soon.

50
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.460
Tang Tanshi. Does it sound good?

51
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.330
I don't want it. It sounds like a joke.

52
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.090
You're not sticking to your words.

53
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.050
That was a special circumstance.

54
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.610
I thought you were going to die, okay?

55
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.140
So I just agreed then.

56
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.370
You're willing to be a widow.

57
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.550
You still don't want to marry me?

58
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.780
I was anxious at the time.

59
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.320
Master. What are you doing?

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.900
Seems like this fire

61
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.140
really helped us find what we were looking for.

62
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.010
Sang Jie hid the gold in the room.

63
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.780
The most dangerous place is also the safest place.

64
00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.850
I think Old Tie already knew the gold was hidden in the County Office.

65
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.160
The key and Sang Jie's tomb

66
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.020
Everything was used to trick Jiang Muchun and divery her attention.

67
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.420
He didn't want to share the gold, but all of it.

68
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.030
No wonder this is the only new wall

69
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.270
is new

70
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.850
Sir, I have news to give the emperor.

71
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.610
Oh my lord.

72
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.200
We've been looking for so long, but it was under our noses the whole time.

73
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.050
We finally found it.

74
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.350
<i> A few months later</i>

76
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.030
Miaomiaosheng!

77
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.990
Everyone, please be quiet. Today Gutang Bookstore's

78
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.710
new branch is open. This coincides with the release of Miaomiaosheng's new novel.

79
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.470
So everything is 20% off.

80
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.260
-Okay.
-Okay.

81
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.060
Don't rush, don't rush.

82
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.080
There's enough for everyone.

83
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.400
-Okay, okay.
-You want this book, right?

84
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.110
Why is Older sister Lingyin still not down here?

85
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.070
-You take this, take this.
-There's too many people.

86
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.780
I don't know either. She quit after she finished her novel.

87
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.570
She said she wanted to experience life and collect inspiration for her next novel.

88
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.280
Miss, don't fight. Everyone will get one.

89
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.310
Okay, okay. Don't fight, there's one for everyone.

90
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.900
Don't scream. Come with me.

91
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.170
Little girl, do you want money or your life?

92
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.670
Is this fun, brother?

93
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.480
How did you recognize me with this disguise?

94
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.970
The same method. The same style. It's not the first time I've been kidnapped by you.

95
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.050
Am I stupid?

96
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.190
Why did you come out today?

97
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.330
I

98
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.380
I'm going to buy roasted chicken.

99
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:11.720
You know how to pick. This is Tongling's best roasted chicken.

100
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.190
This is the most beautiful boss in all of
Tongling's roasted chicken place.

101
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.670
So you were not here to eat roasted chicken,
but here for the boss?

102
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.720
Don't talk nonsense. There's only you in my heart.

103
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.620
You may say that, but you treat me like your brother.

104
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.940
Anyway, I'm already taken.

105
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.520
If you want to be in a relationship in the latter half of your life, then stop mentioning me all the time.

106
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.510
What latter half of my life?

107
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.050
I will happily wander around Jianghu and be carefree.

108
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.160
I never waste a moment on women.

109
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.900
Really?

110
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:50.750
Let's go eat.

111
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.240
-Go.
-Let's go.

112
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.030
Guess what, my novels are selling really well.

113
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.460
Look.

114
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.830
-Wow, there's a lot.
-I'm treating.

115
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.590
-Okay. 
-Clean it more carefully!

116
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.930
Head Constable Zheng!

117
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.110
-Head Constable Zheng. 
-Head Constable Zheng.

118
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:25.300
You two have done a great job at rebuilding the County Office. Here is some compensation.

119
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.010
-This much? 
- Take it. Lord Tang wanted to thank everyone.

120
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:36.400
This time we all worked hard. Take this money and live a good life. You two put your money away!

121
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.150
Yes.

122
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.660
I must go to the Capital to provide a report.

123
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.950
These two letters are the recommendations for the new Magistrate.

124
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.540
He will definitely support you guys.

125
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:56.490
Xiaoliu, this ribbon really suites you.

126
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:08.890
Master.

127
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:14.120
Sir, you were the best Magistrate.

128
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.970
Okay. Our master isn't dying.

129
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:25.380
Besides, you've only known that corrupt official Sang Jie. Stop flattering him.

130
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.600
Right.

131
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.420
As for Cong Shun, I've let him stay. Someone who turns over a new leaf is precious. Take care of him well.

132
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:38.310
Yeah. Then Sir we will leave first.

133
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.200
Giving out money? Where is mine?

134
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.380
I'm going back to the Capital.

135
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.390
Why does it matter to me?

136
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.650
What are you saying?

137
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:57.180
This is a good chance to take advantage while they're off guard. Why don't you know to treasure it?

138
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.130
I understand now. You called me here to give me a warning, right?

139
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.300
You're scared I will do something to Linying when you're not here.

140
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.780
Lord Tang. Lord Tang, why are you so petty.

141
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.970
Rest assured.  As a wanderer of Jianghu, when I say I've put it down it means I've put it down.

142
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:22.330
I won't concern myself with Lingying. And for this money,

143
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:27.200
I will watch over her. If someone tries to snatch her I will...

144
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.330
-I'm leaving! 
- Do some serious business with your brothers.

145
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.160
Thanks.

148
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.210
Why are you here?

149
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.710
Thank you. 
 Try one.

150
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:40.100
It's sweet, in the future it won't be bitter.

151

Master said that everyone makes mistakes.

152
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.690
As long as you're willing to change, we will all treat you like we did before.

153
00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.140
Really?

154
00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.110
I don't have to go?

155
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.820
No.

156
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.620
I finally have a home.

157
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.950
Eat another one.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.390
So sweet.

159
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.280
When you smile it's even sweeter.

160
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.460
Boss. 
 Wait a second.

161
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:40.700
You pulled me out to buy a blanket?

162
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.920
What else?

163
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.900
I have no alternative but to stay at your place for a few nights.

164
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.520
All of Tongling's inns are full?

165
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:57.600
Thanks to you, there are so many young girls who came to Tongling to see what Tang Tianyuan looks like.

166
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.840
Now our guest rooms are all full. Shouldn't you take responsibility for me.

167
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.540
Here. Customer,  what kind of fabric do you want?

168
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.700
Any requirements for size and quality?

169
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.280
I want cotton from Huizhou with embroidery in Suzhou.

170
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.600
How long is your bed?

171
00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.790
Let me think.

172
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:21.000
You two are newlyweds right? Your affection is so sweet. You even come and buy quilt covers together.

173
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.710
No. No.

174
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.100
I know. You are a bit shy. How about I pick one for you?

175
00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.270
How about this one? Newlyweds should use red covers.

176
00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:32.500
This one is nice, it really suites us.

177
00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.990
Really? Did you do this on purpose?

178
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.600
The shopkeeper found out with his discerning eyes.

179
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.220
No.

180
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.560
Then we are sharing a blanket.

181
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.130
How much?

182
00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:49.760
3 <i>liang</i>

183
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.180
Pay.

184
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.680
Good eyes.

185
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.430
Good bye!

186
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:05.170
Little Fang, Little Zhuang! Help Master Tang pack his luggage.

187
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:06.680
Okay!

188
00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.740
Let me see.

189
00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.240
Manager, do you still want this mirror?

190
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.990
How did it break?

191
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.630
I woke up last night and saw the boss turning over fireworks.

192
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.920
I lost my grip and...

193
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.150
Such a big crack. There's no way it can still be used.

194
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.600
It's okay. You guys can get back to work.

195
00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:38.900
Oh.

196
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.820
See I told you, it's okay.

197
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.090
He has such a nice temper. He won't scold me.

198
00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.150
Qingchen, look!

199
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.810
<i> When you look at the candle through the crack,</i>

200
00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.800
<i> if you look at it like this, the flame looks much bigger.</i>

201
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.580
Really!

202
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.900
<i> If there's no crack, then the light won't shine through.</i>

203
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.400
<i> The mirror is so much better with this crack.</i>

204
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.520
<i> Is it okay for the mirror to be broken for this sliver of light?</i>

205
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.880
<i> There is no mirror that won't be broken.</i>

206
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.280
We have to think in a positive way.

207
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.850
Or else how are we going to live?

208
00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.900
<i> Your family doesn't want you anymore. This a crack.</i>

209
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.950
<i> But my mum and I are the light that penetrates through the crack.</i>

210
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.840
<i> Mother's death is also a crack.</i>

211
00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:09.400
<i> But you will remember me from time to time, and bring me steamed buns. </i>

212
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.420
<i> You are my light. </i>

213
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:15.390
<i> Then you are my light, and I am your light! </i>

214
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:30.980
Lord Tang.

215
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.540
A letter came from the palace. The queen really misses you.

216
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.960
Let's go back to the palace together.

217
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.100
I already told your sister.

218
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.390
She's accepted this, so you don't need to worry.

219
00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:59.830
Lord Tang, thank you.

220
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.930
Ever since our Mother died, my sister and I have relied on each other.

221
00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.100
I never thought that someone would come between us.

222
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.730
And become a vital part of our lives.

223
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:21.070
I still remember when I was young, I broke my father's concubine's bronze mirror.

224
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:25.500
She was so angry. It was my sister who took the punishment for me.

225
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.910
She said

226
00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:33.070
This crack is my past.

227
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.990
But she and her mother were the light that penetrates through the crack.

228
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:45.250
So truthfully speaking, when you first appeared.

229
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.080
I thought my light had been stolen.

230
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.650
Qingchen. Relax.

231
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.470
I am here. I won't let you or your sister endure any wrong.

232
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.100
I ask you, brother-in-law, you must take care of my sister well.

233
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:11.550
Master. Come up to drink some beer.

234
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.400
Go quickly, brother-in-law.

235
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:13.930
Okay.

236
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:26.900
Okay.

237
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:33.320
Thank you, brother-in-law.

238
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.600
Sis, the cracks in our lives

239
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.400
will always find the light eventually. You found Master Tang,

240
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.700
But you will always be my light.

241
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.400
The moonlight is pretty tonight.

242
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.900
Yeah.

243
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.100
We found the gold, everything is back to normal.

244
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.400
Looking back now, it's so hard to forget everything.

245
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.800
Aren't I the biggest gain?

246
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.500
When we first met I prepared a foot basin for you.

247
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.600
And tricked you out of so much money. Isn't that very cruel?

248
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.500
Yeah, but I like it a lot.

249
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.600
Right.

250
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.200
Now the emperor wants me to go back and report to him. The office in the capital also needs me for a case.

251
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.000
Do you want to go back with me first,

252
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.400
Or are you going to go back with Xi Hulu later?

253
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.700
You have your own path to go and I have my own things to do.

254
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.800
You can also write books when you go to the Captial.

255
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.400
Qingchen will go back to the Capital with you soon.

256
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.300
Someone has to look after the bookstore.

257
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:22.800
Besides, I need to write the ending to the detective novels soon.

258
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.900
But we aren't here. How can you do it alone?

259
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:30.800
I grew up.

260
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.600
The Capital needs you, Tongling's small bookstore

261
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.400
It needs me.

262
00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.710
Well you always have your own ideas.

263
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.600
Although it's been busy since I ran away from the marriage till now, I've realised a truth.

264
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:53.800
Even though I was born as a woman, I am not anyone's accessory.

265
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.800
I have my own things to do.

266
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.500
And I shouldn't lose myself for love.

267
00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.500
You like the hardworking me right?

268
00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.000
You grew up.

269
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.000
Right. There is one more thing.

270
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.700
Thank you.

271
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.200
Thank you for not letting me lose hope when I was young.

272
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.300
And thank you for giving me the courage to do what I want to do.

273
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.700
I also want to thank, the brave younger me.

274
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:51.600
Without him

275
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.800
I don't know how I would be able to find you

276

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.800
God put in so much effort to put you in front of me.
 ♫<i> with just the right balance of love </i>♫

279
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.400

280
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.500
That is of course.

They say that time reveals a person's heart.

Head constable Zheng, I brought the books you wanted.

317
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.640
-Qingchen. Welcome.
-Sit, sit.

318
00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.820
Come over here. Sit.

319
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.240
-Sit here, sit here.
-Everyone, take a seat.

320
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.300
When are we starting?

321
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.830
Is it a farewell party for Tang Tianyuan? I must eat a lot then.

322
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.360
What are you saying?

323
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.400
If not for Lord Tang helping you to clear your name,

324
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.100
you would be in Tianmu Mountain eating tree barks!

325
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.580
Wait.

326
00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:51.730
-The dishes are here.
-Miss.

327
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.670
Be careful. It's nothing.

328
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.820
Hurry and sit.

329
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.830
Magistrate Assistant Zhou?

330
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:03.000
Oh... this is making me blind.

331
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.520
Previously I heard Sir talking about Assistant Zhou. Who knew she'd be so pretty?

332
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.600
It's not as pretty as you.

333
00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.830
Head constable Zheng, didn't you say

334
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:21.060
the dishes made by Miss Ruyi would cause a stomachache.

335
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:31.410
As long Miss Ruyi is willing to make it,
I'll eat the dishes for the rest of my life.

336
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.120
-Shut up.
-Advisor, you're here.

337
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.280
Let's start.

338
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.280
We're starting? Everyone, let's eat.

339
00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.640
Sister. How come master didn't come?

340
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.610
He said he would see you all in the future.

341
00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.210
I suppose he's already on this way now.

342
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:52.300
Look.

343
00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.830
What beautiful fireworks.

344
00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:28.020
Let's eat everyone. The dishes are getting cold.

345
00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.610
Here, here.

346
00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.890
Eat more.

347
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.720
Here, here.

348
00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.170
<i> ♫ The overnight spring breeze, ♫</i>

349
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.720
<i> ♫ As I go out into the world, hoping not to disappoint ♫</i>

350
00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.100

351
00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.970
<i> ♫ Just this ferry of longing, I can't let go ♫</i>

352
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.760
<i> ♫ The ferry keeps floating, but the way back seems endless ♫</i>

353
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:22.570
<i> ♫ The chilling waters brought a lonely boat that caught my eye ♫</i>

354
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.070
<i> ♫ A fierce horse, ♫</i>

355
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:27.540
<i> ♫ Where is it going in this mortal world? ♫</i>

356
00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.890
<i> ♫ Where can I leisurely see to the limit ♫</i>

357
00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:33.770

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.300

361
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:52.770

362
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:56.200

363
00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.070
<i> ♫ Freely pick a song ♫</i>

364
00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:02.620
<i> ♫ A good dream, a youth’s travels ♫</i>

365
00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:09.000
<i> ♫ The swaying shadows from the candle and longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

366
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.680
<i> ♫ Who is lamenting under the moon? ♫</i>

367
00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.360
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

368
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:22.990
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

369
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:34.100
<i> ♫ Accompanied by pear blossoms, I drink until drunk ♫</i>

370
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:38.960
<i> ♫ And another cup ♫</i>

371
00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:44.000
Older sister Lingyin have been looking
out the window for half a year.

372
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.200
I think she's worried about new inspiration.

373
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:51.390
Stupid. Sister Lingyin is lovesick.

374
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.410
Tang master has been gone for 7 months.

375
00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.860
How come he's not back?

376
00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.600
Don't eat so much.

377
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.040
I didn't eat that many.

378
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:06.450
Master.

379
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:10.820
Sister.

380
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.030
Qingchen.

381
00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.860
You're back. I'll make some food for you to eat.

382
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.800
-I'll clean up your room.
-Okay.

383
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.510
Sister.

384
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.590
You are back. How is it? is it good?

385
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.130
Are you tired? Go rest.

386
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:30.990
It's just Tang master isn't back.

387
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.330
The Emperor still needs him so he can't come back as promised.

388
00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.150
Okay. 
 What?

389
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.430
I've not seen you for half a year, you look like a frostbitten fruit. Isn't it just Sir Tang only?

390
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:45.160
Who was it who said before that they would also enjoy their life without him?

391
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.380
Of course,

392
00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.130
I was just tired from writing all night.

393
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.340
Oh, right older sister. Did Miaosheng House reopen again?

394
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:59.340
I haven't even gone to see it yet. Can you go with me?

395
00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:04.070
I am not in the mood today, let's go another time. Go rest since you just came back, okay?

396
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:07.990
Then did you know that Zhou Ruyi is pregnant?

397
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.360
What?

398
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.290
Head constable Zheng, this beast! I will go look for him right now!

399
00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.730
Hey.

400
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.830
Customers, come in this way.

401
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.630
Have a good day, come again next time.

402
00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:32.200
This way please.

403
00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.860
Come back again.

404
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.220
You come here often.

405
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.330
Zheng Shaofeng, come out.

406
00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.860
What kind of person is here making a scene?

407
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.520
My surname is Tang, name is Feilong.

408
00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.590
I am a great scholar.

409
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.750
To help His Majesty ease his worries, I have come here.

410
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:58.490
Somehow, I became the magistrate of this little county.

411
00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.230
But there's no advisor here.

412
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.230
What should I do?

413
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.630
I heard the office is looking for an Advisor. I have come to take a look.

414
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.220
How can a woman be an Advisor?

415
00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.840
Sir, don't look down on girls. I am talented in both martial arts and literary skills.

416
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.490
Come on.

417
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:22.300
Let's try.

418
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.490
Miss, be careful of your stomach.

419
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:27.670
Let go.

420
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:31.130
Stop acting. It's fake, not fun at all.

421
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:32.540
Hug.

422
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:34.860
Wait.

423
00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.120
You. Will you look at the miss who sells tofu anymore?

424
00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.760
I haven't. I haven't looked.

425
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.200
Forget it. A real man doesn't argue with women.

426
00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.430
At this time, a man should sharply shout:

427
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.390
Miss, I was wrong.

428
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:54.180
Miss, don't be angry or it'll hurt our daughter.

429
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.200
Why can't it be a son? A son.

430
00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.830
If it's a son, we will both take care of you.

431
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.930
If it's a girl

432
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:05.060
I'll take care of you both.

433
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.240
The temperature is getting colder in July, and August is not over.

434
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.260
It's a great time to hold a wedding.

435
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:46.140
If everything goes well, by this time next year

436
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.300
we will be able to take our child to see the first snow.

437
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:03.120
Advisor, love is all.
