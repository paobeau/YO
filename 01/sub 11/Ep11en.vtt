(Previously on Episode 10)
I really like you.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:41,900
I really...

17
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,420
Thank you, anyway.

18
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,620
That's it?

19
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,780
Want to be in a relationship now?

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,820
Yes.

21
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:49,740
With whom?

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,710
Zhou Xiao.

(Episode 11: The Hidden Signal of Heartbeat)

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,580
(Nanfang University Forensic Lab)

25
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,960
In Blood Sample A,

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,980
a tiny amount of carbonyl hemoglobin
is detected.

27
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,380
Continue to test Sample B.

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,000
Understood.

29
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,620
Your two-hour isolation and learning

30
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,220
finally comes to an end.

31
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,580
I'm finished.

32
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,120
He said he would like to be
my forensic consultant,

33
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,380
but he never texted me back.

34
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:58,900
Ah!

35
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,020
I'm starving!

36
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,940
Lu said she would bring us midnight snacks.

37
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,060
How come she hasn't returned yet?

38
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,000
You scared me.

39
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,060
Since you can't wait any longer,

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,310
why not ask Fang Wei to buy it for you?

41
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,100
As Fang Wei said,
considering I don't like sports,

42
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,900
if I eat snacks late at night,

43
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,020
I will die very early.

44
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,060
To today's young people,

45
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,830
longevity means nothing at all.

46
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:21,740
I'm back.

47
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,940
Finally you're back!

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,980
I'm starving.

49
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,780
Wait, wait.

50
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,940
The oil spills out.

51
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
Let me find a lunch box.

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,300
Lunch box, lunch box.

53
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,140
Sure enough, take-out is the most delicious.

54
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,900
Are these your lunch boxes?

55
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,060
They don't want to wash them.

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,180
I'm really impressed by you two.

57
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,460
Don't you know

58
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,780
laziness is the ladder of human progress?

59
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:56,700
Exactly!

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,860
You always have a reason.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,900
As I've just seen on the campus network,

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,220
on the night of 31st this month,

63
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,020
that is, the day after tomorrow,

64
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
there will be the Geminids.

65
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,060
Let's go and see them together.

66
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,310
No, I won't see them with you.

67
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,360
I'd like to see them with Fang Wei.

68
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,940
What a traitor!

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,060
You're a traitor.

70
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,820
Well, so are you.

71
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,740
You went out with Zhao Fanzhou
every day previously.

72
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,940
Did I complain about that?

73
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,820
I went out

74
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,260
with Zhao Fanzhou every day?

75
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,620
We are doing part-time jobs together.

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,780
By the way,

77
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,190
he has been absent from work for four days.

78
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,660
Four days? You remember it so clearly.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,980
That's because

80
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,420
I have to do his job too.

81
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,430
Of course, I remember it.

82
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,260
Really?

83
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,820
Wei, I'll go and see
the meteor shower with you.

84
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,340
Okay.

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,740
Why don't you invite me?

86
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,500
You can take this opportunity

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,580
to ask the president of
the Badminton Club out with you.

88
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,540
Good idea.

89
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,740
Will it be

90
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,420
too obvious?

91
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,980
If we go out together,

92
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,020
it won't be obvious at all.

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,900
31st.

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,430
Fine.

95
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,660
This time,

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,060
my boyfriend has to give way to my friends.

97
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,340
After all, friends come first.

98
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,380
Long live

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,070
our friendship!

100

(999 Ganmaoling Granules)

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,740
Let me repay your loyalty

102
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,340
with meat.

103
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,060
Here you are.

104
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,260
It's my idea.

105
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,300
I want meat too.

106
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,060
Wei, you've become a bad girl!

107
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,430
You can't do this.

108
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:46,820
Yes, I can.

109
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,380
You really can't do this.

110
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes, I can.

111
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,300
To sum up,

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,580
the basic ideological tendency of

Why did he text me back so late at night?

115

(Hi! I've finished a new chapter.
I'm sending it to you. Give me some advice.)

116
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,620
In other words, it contains...

117
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,630
Will you go to the library today?

118
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,580
That's all

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,740
for today's review.

120
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,340
You've done a good job.

121
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,860
This semester's class

122
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,980
comes to an end.

123
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,300
I wish you can get good grades
in the final exam.

124
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,340
Sir, you haven't underlined
the key points of the exam.

125
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,480
My lectures

126
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,060
are all key points.

127
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,220
Exactly.

128
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,020
Your lectures are all highlights.

129
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,060
But the exam paper is not big enough

130
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,540
to include all the highlights.

131
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,540
Stop flattering me.

132
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,620
How about this?

133
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,700
You can memorize

134
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,860
all the notes you've taken in my class.

135
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,860
That's all I can tell you.

136
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,220
Class is over.

137
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,500
Thank you, sir.

138
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,500
Here you are.

139
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,740
Those written in blue ink

140
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,540
are points the teacher emphasized
at least twice in class.

141
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,380
I love you so much!

142
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,620
Let's make copies of this.

143
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,020
Make a copy for me.

144
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,780
I have to go to the library for work.

145
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,060
Are you in a hurry to work

146
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,420
or to see someone in the library?

147
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,940
Don't talk nonsense!

148
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,780
I'm leaving.

149
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,540
Bye.

150
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,300
Bye.

151
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,260
Cai Yasi seems to get knocked out.

152
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,420
Why?

153
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,140
Do you always think Cai Yasi
is more likely to be her boyfriend?

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm only a fence-sitter.

155
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,460
I'll stand up for whomever my friend likes.

156
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,020
Me too.

157
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,900
You've finally come to work.

158
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,220
Sorry.

159
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,580
I'm mistaken.

160
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Never mind.

161
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,180
You're so early today.

162
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,620
Yeah.

163
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,500
It's almost the end of the semester.

164
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,940
A lot of students come to return books,

165
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,720
so I'm a little busy lately.

166
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,020
Oh.

167
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,340
I can ask the office

168
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,870
to send someone to help you.

169
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,500
That's great. Thank you, Ms. Huang.

170
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,900
Ms. Huang.

171
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,380
What's the matter?

172
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,940
Um...

173
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,220
Did Zhao Fanzhou quit his job?

174
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,820
No.

175
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,940
These days, he is working on a project
under his tutor's instruction.

176
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,660
So he asked for leave.

177
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,140
So that explains it.

178
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,780
I thought he had quit.

179
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
No, he just asked for leave.

180
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,380
I see.

181
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,460
Ms. Huang, can I go out to answer the phone?

182
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,360
Sure.

183
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,910
Is the intensified training over?

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,540
No, not yet.

185
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,820
I told you to focus on it,

186
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,550
why are you still calling me?

187
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,100
Stop kidding.

188
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,540
I came out to call you secretly.

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,500
If the teacher finds out,

190
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,340
I'll be scolded severely.

191
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,020
Let's get to the point.

192
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,460
Do you know the Detective Art Festival

193
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,060
will be held tomorrow?

194
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,700
Yes, of course.

195
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,900
But I didn't

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,940
get a ticket.

197
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,260
You're so lucky.

198
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,740
I got two tickets.

199
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:56,900
Cai Yasi,

200
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,940
I respect you!

201
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,620
I won't say you're stingy any more.

202
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,020
You're not stingy at all.

203
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,180
In fact, you're quite generous.

204
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,420
So, let's meet at the exhibition tomorrow.

205
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,100
Call me when you leave the dorm.

206
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,820
I'll get there from here.
It's a very short distance.

207
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,060
Okay.

208
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,180
I'll wait for you at the entrance

209
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,740
and lay a red carpet for you.

210
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,660
Your attitude has changed

211
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,540
so fast.

212
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,700
All right.

213
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm going back.

214
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,180
Take care!

215
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,260
Feed and clothe yourself well!

216
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,740
Wish you a long life!

217
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,100
What makes you sigh?

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,540
The Detective Exhibition?

219
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,740
So you want to ask Zhou Xiao
to go there with you?

220
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,460
Yeah.

221
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,620
But

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,100
the tickets have been sold out.

223
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,100
Alas! Look,

224
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,620
it's all my fault.

225
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,340
I've made you so busy with the project

226
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,060
that you don't even have time
to go out with girls.

227
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,340
I must find a way to make up for your loss.

228
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,380
Never mind, Professor.

229
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,660
Let's continue with the experiment.

230
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,500
We have to get the last set of data.

231
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,620
Water?

232
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:01,700
No, thanks.

233
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,580
I know a new move.

234
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,380
It's really awesome.

235
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,220
Do you want to learn it?

236
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:09,820
No, thanks.

237
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,260
What's wrong with you?

238
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,940
Talk to me.

239
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,740
You're here.

240
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,140
Sorry,

241
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,860
I'm late.

242
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,260
No, no, I'm not blaming you.

243
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,260
What's wrong?

244
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,140
Anything else?

245
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,740
I've heard that

246
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,620
the Geminids will come tomorrow.

247
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,260
Would you like to see them
with me on the playground?

248
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,740
What are you talking about?

249
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,420
All my roommates will be there,

250
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,020
not just us.

251
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,420
Okay.

252
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Let's meet on the playground tomorrow.

253
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,220
Okay.

254
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:06,860
I'll go there too.

255
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,660
Go ahead.

256
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,180
The playground is not mine.

257
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
Can you help me buy two tickets

258
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,140
to tomorrow's Detective Exhibition?

259
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,260
As a hot badminton star,

260
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,700
I can get whatever you want.

261
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,790
Professor.

262
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,140
Yes?

263
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,100
I've got all the data.

264
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,140
Please have a check.

265
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,020
There is no need

266
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,340
to check.

267
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,000
I trust you.

268
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,480
Okay.

269
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,060
It's all over.

270
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,580
Find some time

271
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,420
to send the data

272
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,340
to the Provincial Judicial Expertise Center.

273
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
I'm leaving now.

274
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,100
Okay.

275
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,380
Tidy up this room.

276
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,180
After that,

277
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,620
dress yourself up too.

278
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,300
You've kept working for days.

279
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,120
A young man like you should look decent.

280
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,940
I'm leaving.

281
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,340
Oh,

282
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,620
stay here for a while.

283
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,580
A student will come to borrow a book from me.

284
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,220
Please give it to her.

285
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,140
Okay.

286
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:19,900
Professor,

287
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,220
where is the book?

288
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,060
Over there.

289
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,900
What's its title?

290
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
There is only one book there.

291
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,120
I'm really a perfect professor.

292
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,780
It took me only 30 minutes
to get the tickets,

293
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,820
during which

294
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,060
I spent 20 minutes wondering
if I should help you.

295
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,480
After all, you've left me behind
all these days.

296
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:11,980
Oh, you're here.

297
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,100
Why are you here?

298
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:16,980
Professor Hu told me

299
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,940
to come here and find a book
about forensic medicine

300
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,700
which can help my writing.

301
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:22,340
I see.

302
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,380
Wait a minute.

303
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,220
I've made you so busy with the project

304
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,780
that you don't even have time
to go out with girls.

305
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,360
I must find a way to make up for your loss.

306
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,500
Let me look more carefully.

307
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,780
Take it easy.

308
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,620
A student handbook?

309
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
But it should be

310
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,300
a book about forensic medicine as he said.

311
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Perhaps,

312
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,900
he hopes you can cultivate
your moral character

313
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,350
and learn to behave yourself
before writing novels?

314
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,460
Are you scolding me?

315
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:24,980
I have no idea.

316
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,220
Ask Professor Hu yourself.

317
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,180
Never mind.

318
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,510
Come with me.

319
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,060
Can I take a look at this?

320
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,820
If I can see it,

321
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:42,940
I won't come in vain even though
I don't get the book.

322
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,620
Wow.

323
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,780
Can I hold it?

324
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:02,260
What's this?

325
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,540
This is

326
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,020
a mouth gag.

327
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,460
We use it to open a dead man's mouth

328
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
to examine his mouth, lips and teeth.

329
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,140
Why should you examine
his mouth, lips and teeth?

330
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,340
By checking whether there is
any contusion or blood

331
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,460
on his oral mucosal tissues

332
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,620
and whether his teeth are loose,

333
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,980
we can judge

334
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,240
if he was suffocated to death
by external force.

335
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,820
And teeth

336
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,140
can be used to identify unknown dead bodies.

337
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,700
Your courses are really interesting.

338
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,780
This is...

339
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,620
Is it a spoon?

340
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,580
Impossible.

341
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,590
It's definitely not an ordinary spoon.

342
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,420
It's just a spoon.

343
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,100
Impossible.

344
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:46,900
Don't try to fool me.

345
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,340
It's really an ordinary spoon.

346
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,060
We use it to ladle out

347
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,380
the liquid in the stomach of a drowned man,

348
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,100
as well as the effusion
and extravasated blood

349
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,300
in the chest and lungs of a dead man.

350
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,820
Here you are.

351
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,380
Well,

352
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,140
can I take a picture?

353
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,860
It may be useful for my novel.

354
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,700
Go ahead.

355
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,140
Thank you.

356
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,960
Are you free tomorrow?

357
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,830
Let's go and see
the Detective Exhibition together.

358
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,460
But I've agreed

359
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,640
to go there with Cai Yasi.

360
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:44,640
Oh.

361
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,340
Sorry.

362
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,860
Never mind.

363
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,620
Next time.

364
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,420
Next time I'll invite you.

365
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm leaving.

366
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,740
Okay.

367
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,420
Why did he suddenly become so cold?

368
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,820
The 27th International Milan Fashion Show

369
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,140
begins!

370
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,660
Do you think we can beat other girls?

371
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:17,700
Well, well.

372
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,860
I think Lu can beat other girls,

373
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,180
but you will be beaten.

374
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,300
You will be crushed.

375
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,700
Don't you want to try on

376
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
clothes for tomorrow?

377
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,180
By then, we will look as pretty as flowers,

378
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,680
and you will look like flower growers.

379
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,180
It's you two who are going
to date boys under meteors,

380
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,140
not us.

381
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,140
Wait a minute.

382
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,620
I'll get my Mihoo facial masks,

383
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,140
these are sponsorship by your friend.

384
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,860
One mask per person.

385
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,900
One mask

386
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,140
to moisturize your skin.

387
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,920
Only one?

388
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,270
You're really stingy.

389
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,740
One is enough. Be content,

390
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,460
okay?

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,980
Aren't you going to see
the exhibition with Cai Yasi?

392
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
That's a date too.

393
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,100
What kind of date is that?

394
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,060
It's more like a spring outing of two pupils.

395
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,060
I think

396
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,020
it's okay for me

397
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,900
to be dressed like this.

398
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,380
Anyway, no boy will notice me.

399
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,260
Who says girls get dressed up only for boys?

400
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,540
We dress ourselves for friends.

401
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,060
Let me pick some clothes for you.

402
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,020
Come on. Come with me.

403
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,220
Which one should I choose?

404
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,860
The red one.

405
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,780
It's eye-catching.

406
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,620
It's too bright.

407
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,060
Come here.

408
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:25,620
You.

409
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,340
Choose one for Wei.

410
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,380
You're better at this.

411
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Come on, girl.

412
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:30,820
Here you are.

413
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,100
Are you serious?

414
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,260
Go, go.

415
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,980
Why are the lights out?

416
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,140
What a bummer!

417
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
Zhou Xiao,

418
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,660
when are you going to get up tomorrow?

419
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,620
Do you need me to wake you up before I leave?

420
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,020
Let me check the route first.

421
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,500
After I make clear how long
it will take to get there,

422
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,260
I'll tell you

423
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,420
if I need you to wake me up.

424
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,460
Okay.

425
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,780
Xiao,

426
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,300
why haven't you checked the route yet?

427
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,860
You seem to be not positive enough.

428
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
Why should I be positive?

429
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,420
I don't think

430
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,620
you really want to see
the exhibition with Cai Yasi.

431
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,020
It's not like that.

432
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:01,620
All right.

433
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,940
After you're done,

434
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,240
come to the playground to find us.

435
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,580
We'll go there early

436
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,100
and get a good position
to watch the meteor shower.

437
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,060
Remember to put on the clothes
we've picked for you today.

438
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,740
Okay.

439
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,060
Have a nice sleep.

440
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,680
Good night.

441
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,860
Good night.

442
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,260
Good night.

443
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,100
Are you free tomorrow?

444
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,340
Let's go and see
the Detective Exhibition together.

445
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,820
But I've agreed

446
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,960
to go there with Cai Yasi.

447
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,340
Oh.

448
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,500
Sorry.

449
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,500
Never mind.

450
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,300
Next time.

451
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,940
Next time I'll invite you.

452
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,350
I'm ready to go.

453
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,180
Thanks.

454
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:15,820
Are you okay?

455
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,380
Yeah.

456
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,100
Why are you here?

457
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,620
I'm delivering a file for Professor Hu.

458
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,340
She has dressed up specially for Cai Yasi.

459
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,740
Are you waiting for Bus 680 too?

460
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,740
How do you know that?

461
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,620
You're supposed to take it
to the Detective Exhibition.

462
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,110
Oh.

463
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,580
Get on the bus.

464
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,400
Sit here.

465
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,820
Reply when you see the message.

466
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,380
By the way,

467
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,020
I sent you the new novel last time.

468
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,480
I've received it.

469
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,860
Where are you going to send the file?

470
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,460
To the Provincial Judicial Expertise Center.

471
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,380
Is that far away?

472
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,100
Yes.

473
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:02,580
Hello?

474
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,340
Why don't you reply to my message?

475
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,820
I'm on my way.

476
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,380
See you about half an hour later.

477
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,020
I'm Cai Yasi's teacher

478
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,380
in the ACM intensified training camp.

479
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,700
Don't try to fool me.

480
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,480
You're so boring.

481
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,540
Cai Yasi attempted

482
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,020
to leave the camp without permission.

483
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,380
Everyone's cell phones should
be confiscated during the training.

484
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,590
Please don't disturb him again.

485
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,550
The training will end tomorrow.

486
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,220
You can talk to him after he returns.

487
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,920
Hello?

488
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,220
What's going on?

489
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,500
What's the matter?

490
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,460
It seems that Cai Yasi can't come out today.

491
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,960
I can go and see the exhibition with you.

492
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,030
But you have to send a file, don't you?

493
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,260
I can send it some other day.

494
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,110
Why have you

495
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,420
changed your mind so suddenly?

496
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,020
Have a guess.

497
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,070
You, you also want to see

498
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,200
the exhibition, right?

499
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,660
Put the file in your bag.

500
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:45,700
Sir,

501
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,720
what did Zhou Xiao say?

502
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,720
Nothing.

503
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:51,070
How can you leave
before you finish your work?

504
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,620
If you can't finish it,

505
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,380
you must stay and continue working

506
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,180
even if the training is over today.

507
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,580
You can detain my body,

508
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,590
but you can't detain my heart.

509
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,060
How dare you talk back to me?!

510
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,240
Focus on your work.

511
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,580
(The Detective Kingdom Art Exhibition)

512
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,660
A detective suit!

513
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,640
My favorite.

514
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,110
You must have been waiting for me so long.

515
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,000
Don't worry.

516
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,740
I'll take you home immediately.

517
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,260
I need a basket.

518
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,160
This one.

519
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:41,790
Let me help you.

520
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,480
Thank you.

521
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,940
Do I look like a detective?

522
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,460
Yeah.

523
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,860
Bow ties.

524
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,220
I have to get some.

525
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,060
Give it to me.

526
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,480
Thanks.

527
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:27,500
Here.

528
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,510
Hello. May I pay the bill?

529
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,790
Miss, it's 628 yuan.

530
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,310
628 yuan?

531
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,310
Well,

532
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,400
take the cookies away from the bill.

533
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,300
Okay.

534
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,750
It's 580 yuan.

535
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,590
Thank you for inviting me to the exhibition.

536
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,620
Let me give you a gift in return.

537
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,070
Thank you.

538
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,380
Why not put it on?

539
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,510
I'd better not.

540
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,590
Will it make you embarrassed?

541
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,860
It doesn't matter at all.

542
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:33,780
You will find it interesting
only if you join me.

543
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,220
Let's have fun today. Don't think too much

544
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,350
Help me.

545
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:42,960
What?

546
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:44,940
I don't know how to put it on.

547
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,030
But...

548
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,060
Let's have fun today.

549
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,420
Don't think too much.

550
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,000
Do you want to put it on?

551
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes.

552
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,270
Hold,

553
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,920
hold this.

554
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,480
All right.

555
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,110
What are you doing?

556
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,200
The glasses.

557
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,660
Do it yourself.

558
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,060
Sir,

559
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,720
well,

560
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,860
can you explain once more

561
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,940
the sieve of Eratosthenes?

562
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,590
It's a problem of number theory
usually found in the contest.

563
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,960
Let me explain it to you.

564
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,460
To find all the prime numbers
less than or equal to

565
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,780
a given integer N, if it's composite,

566
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:03,300
all its divisors

567
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,860
won't be more than its square root.

568
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,300
Sir,

569
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,880
sir.

570
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,900
You can use this method

571
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,500
to intuitively find

572
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,760
all the prime numbers
less than or equal to N.

573
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:15,800
Sir.

574
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,300
Here is the programming algorithm
I've written.

575
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,740
Can you check if it's right?

576
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,880
Let me see.

577
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,550
Use a different algorithm.

578
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
It's a seal.

579
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,630
Let me try.

580
00:34:59,070 --> 00:34:59,620
Look.

581
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,440
Here you are.

582
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,740
Enjoy yourself.

583
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,110
I'll go and buy something.

584
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,400
Oh. Okay.

585
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,400
Hey.

586
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,180
Lift me. I want the seal.

587
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,710
Boy,

588
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,550
you're too rude.

589
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,280
Come on.

590
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Come on.

591
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,860
You're so weak.

592
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,150
The seals you've got are all the same.

593
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,110
You're so short

594
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,140
that you can't even reach the seal.

595
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,980
You're so ugly

596
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,800
with glasses

597
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,780
that you can't find a boyfriend.

598
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,030
You...

599
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,000
Come down.

600
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,280
Do it yourself.

601
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,150
I won't find

602
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,320
a girlfriend like you
who is so ugly with glasses.

603
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,800
I...

604
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,400
All right, all right.

605
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:14,670
Come on.

606
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,960
Impress the seal on your notebook.

607
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,460
How come you, a little boy,

608
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,300
are so mean to others?

609
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,440
Hey, thank you.

610
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,780
You're welcome.

611
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,660
Do I really look ugly?

612
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,480
What's wrong?

613
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,320
Nothing.

614
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,960
Where are your glasses?

615
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,510
I took them off.

616
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,630
They're too heavy.

617
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:23,510
I won't wear them, either.

618
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:32,820
Can I put them in your bag?

619
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,180
Of course.

620
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,480
Okay. Let's go.

621
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,280
Okay.

622
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,300
Come here.

623
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,150
Take a picture of my idols and me.

624
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:19,980
I'll stand in the middle.

625
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,800
I want both of them.

626
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,550
I'll stand in the middle.

627
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,590
What are you doing?

628
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,510
Look at the camera.

629
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,020
(Cai Yasi)

630
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:45,840
Hello?

631
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,820
I'm already at the entrance
to the Detective Exhibition

632
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,980
and having my ticket checked.

633
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,660
Where are you now?

634
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,190
What?

635
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,900
I'm seeing the exhibition.

636
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,710
Didn't you say you couldn't come today?

637
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,180
All right.

638
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,630
I'm coming out. Wait for me.

639
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:00,540
Sorry.

640
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,510
I'll come back later.

641
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,000
Cai Yasi is here.

642
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,110
Let's go and find him.

643
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:15,840
Here is my ticket.

644
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,700
Okay.

645
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,220
Where did you buy the ticket?

646
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,660
It took me a long time to get it.

647
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,550
I bought it online too.

648
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,780
Cai Yasi.

649
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,070
I thought you didn't manage to escape.

650
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,340
Why did you two come together?

651
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,140
We

652
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,140
met on the bus.

653
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,660
What a coincidence!

654
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,980
You have a ticket too?

655
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,900
Anyway, I was stood up by you.

656
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,260
Sorry...

657
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,670
I didn't mean to.

658
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,030
Forget it.

659
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,710
This is for you.

660
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,190
Thanks.

661
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:57,980
You're welcome.

662
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:00,980
But why do you give it to me?

663
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,580
If I haven't been caught by my teacher,

664
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,630
I would have come
and see the exhibition with you.

665
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:09,230
Right?

666
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,700
It's meaningless to make an assumption

667
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,630
while ignoring the result.

668
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,920
Here are the cookies
you wanted to buy just now.

669
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,670
Is this also for me?

670
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,400
Why did you buy so many cookies?

671
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,920
For you and your roommates.

672
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,630
It's weird.

673
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,140
Why are you guys

674
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,020
so nice to me today?

675
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,540
I've never been treated like this before?

676
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:49,580
Am I sick?

677
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,860
No, I'm very well.

678
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,860
No.

679
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,980
When will the meteor shower begin?

680
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,280
Why should we go so early?

681
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,340
What if it comes earlier?

682
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,710
Exactly. Let's go.

683
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,980
I'm going that way.

684
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,440
I have to go to the playground to see
the meteor shower with my roommates.

685
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,880
Let's go together.

686
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,220
Fanzhou,

687
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,070
I'm waiting for the meteor shower
on the playground.

688
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,460
Would you like to come and see it with me?

689
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,180
I'll get a good position for you.

690
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,780
I'll sign for you all. Take it easy.

691
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,440
Why isn't Zhou Xiao here yet?

692
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,670
Who knows?

693
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,980
Zhou Xiao!

694
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,360
Come here.

695
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,420
Why aren't you on the playground?

696
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,300
Come on.

697
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,180
Did you see the fall series?

698
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Yes, we did.

699
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,360
Is he holding a signing session?

700
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,580
Are we going to see the meteors

701
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,740
or the badminton star?

702
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,880
At first, only one girl

703
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,940
recognized him.

704
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:50,900
But he said in a voice

705
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,660
even louder than campus broadcast,

706
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,190
"It's me!

707
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,860
I'm Xie Yixing, the badminton star!"

708
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,880
Then it became like this.

709
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,110
Leave him alone.

710
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:00,820
Let's go inside.

711
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:01,940
Go inside?

712
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,940
We were pushed out by the crowd just now.

713
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,740
I've conservatively estimated

714
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,630
that there should be 3,000 people at least.

715
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
3,000?

716
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,420
How about seeing the meteor shower
somewhere else?

717
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,060
All good places have been occupied now.

718
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,060
Where can we go?

719
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,880
I know a place.

720
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:17,780
Where is it?

721
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,180
We've been there before.

722
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,420
What place?

723
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,590
The deserted teaching building
where we looked for the cat together.

724
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:25,190
Fanzhou,

725
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,920
why didn't you answer my phone?

726
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,500
(Next Episode)

727
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,150
His confession at the school anniversary
was so romantic.

728
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,860
They will be together sooner or later, right?

729
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,300
You two can have a try.

730
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:48,980
I think your mind must be in sync

731
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,960
with Cai Yasi's.

732
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:02,960
