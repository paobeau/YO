- What? 
 - What?

36

- W-W-Why? What? 
 - What? W-W-What? What about me? Huh?

37
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.300
No... well... I'm sorry. I think I misheard.

38
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.420
I didn't say anything.

You definitely said you were going to do somethi—

40
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.800
No, I definitely didn't say anything.

41
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.430
Ah! Uhm, oh, I'm sorry.

42
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.380
Why? Did you do something to me that you're sorry about?

43
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.570
No, no. That... I'm sorry.

44
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.310
That's also an apology.

45
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.250
Why are you apologizing? I'm about to feel bad.

46
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.200
- I'm sorry. 
 - Why?!

47
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.630
I think it's best if we just go quietly.

48
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.730
No... okay.

49
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.330
There... Drop me off.

50
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.460
Okay.

51
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.420
- I'll drop you off at your house— 
 - No, I'll get off here.

52
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.810
Excuse me... Do you perhaps like men?

53
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.630
What?

54
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.460
No matter how you see me, don't I not... look like that?

55
00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.190
I... I was wondering if you are single for a reason that can't be spoken out loud.

56
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:04.180
I'm the type to respect one's sexual preference, so...

57
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.760
I'm... not.

58
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.410
Okay.

59
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.860
Earlier...

60
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:22.050
I hope my apology doesn't disturb your sleep.

61
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.710
Goodnight.

62
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.200
Yes.

63
00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.600
Ah, you scared me!

64
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.580
You must be crazy. What are you doing there?

65
00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.870
Why'd you come here now? Were you with Han Yisang this whole time?

66
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.870
I'm tired. I'll listen to you nag tomorrow.

67
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.050
It was a day trip, why did it become two days and one night?

68
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.390
That's true. I don't know why I did two days and one night.

69
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.760
I feel like you're getting slightly crazy these days.

70
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.460
You didn't throw yourself or attack him, right?

71
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.870
I should have.

72
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.870
You really—!

73
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.450
Hey.

74
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.060
How am I as a woman?

75
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.400
What?

76
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.290
- Not that good? 
 - No.

77
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:20.970
- You're not mediocre. 
 - Right?

78
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.860
If a woman like you hits on someone,

79
00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.380
and the man has no reaction, he's either a priest or a monk...

80
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.040
Highly likely he is asexual.

81
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.410
Hmph...

82
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.060
What is the meaning of that smile?

83
00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.180
You need to meet the right man. You can't just fall over him just looking at the outside.

84
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.150
Jang Hari!

85
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.810
What is she going around doing?

86
00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:09.930
I should have. Right?

87
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.320
Just once would be all right,

88
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.400
wouldn't it? No, I guess it wouldn't...

89
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.680
No, right? No.

90
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.990
No.

91

94
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.150
Give it. Now.

95
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:01.070
If I give you the egg from bibimbap, I'm giving you everything. Who are you to do so?

96
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.410
You don't want to become a spoon, right?

97
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.780
I can try fry one more.

98
00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.220
I lost my appetite seeing him eat.

99
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.400
So similar. You both are the same age, too.

100
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.830
Why don't your eyes meet when you guys are so compatible?

101
00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.150
- Why would I meet eyes with him—? 
 - I'm eating!

102
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.680
- Why are you talking about dirty things? 
 - I'm getting ingestion!

Why is the font so small?

106
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.050
- Send a message. 
 - Okay.

107
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.140
"Okay."

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.130
Is your mountain climbing club going somewhere?

111
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.380
To Donghae. For 2 days and 1 night.

112
00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.480
- 2 days 1 night? 
 - Wow.

113
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.310
Are you sure you're going as a group?

114
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.350
What does he do? Shall I prepare my heart?

115
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.310

 - Ow, that hurts!

116
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.330
Is it the time to worry about my dating life? What about you?

117
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.540
I'm looking for a confident sperm donor.

118
00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.530
You can't even find a normal man,

119
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.180
how could you possibly find a confident man?

120
00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.780
Mom, go buy some squid!

121
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.690
Do you know when politicians lose most of their voters?

122
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.320
What are you going to say now?

123
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.690
It's when they've made a lot of promises but fail to follow through.

124
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:33.540
They shouldn't promise to fix the economy just to line their pockets.

125
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.320
But?

126
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.830
Bear in mind. Not a man, but a sperm.

127
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:47.300
I'm your supporter, so don't go back on your promise.

128
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.570
Just eat your food.

129
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:52.660
Hm? I do like food.

130
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:55.730
Eat quietly.

131
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:58.700
This is the quietest I've ever eaten.

132
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.500
I can't stand the sight of you.

133
00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:09.120
So when you called Hari the day before yesterday, she said she couldn't make it because of the mudslide?

134
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.240
I saw the expenses she was working on,

135
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.080
and it was suspiciously blank.

136
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.590
They must have slept together!

137
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:17.450
Many babies are conceived during big events.

138
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.190
Just think of the world cup season.

139
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.000
You're older than I am?

140
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.510
...is what I read in an article.

141
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.040
Even so...

142
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:37.950
I also suddenly had to get married because of an overnight trip.

143
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:42.070
Do you really think something happened between those two?

144
00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.060
When a natural disaster, of all things, helps you out

145
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.940
you'd have to be an idiot not to take advantage of that.

146
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.080
- Editor Jang! 
 - Hi.

147
00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.590
Did something nice happen?

148
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.630
Oh, nothing of the sort.

149
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.680
No, you're definitely glowing.

150
00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.750
How's the preparation for the special feature?

151
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.810
Ugh, I'm so busy.

152
00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:02.600
Work hard. Stay strong.

153
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.130
Bye.

154
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.570
See?! She can't stop smiling. All the world must seem rosy and pink.

155
00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:11.730
Should I give her pink bed sheets for her wedding?

156
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.500
Wouldn't money be better?

157
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.930
Did we just send her down the aisle already?

158
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.150
No, we'd better plan her baby shower instead.

159
00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:24.020
What's with her?

160
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.320
What? Was the soil barren?

161
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.480
Is it true that she's has zero successes with blind dates?

162
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.520
She's 100% successful at fending them off.

163
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.390
No way. She's probably just in a bad mood.

164
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.810
Hari hasn't dated in about 10 years, so all her dating skills have atrophied.

165
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.850
Yisang is the same way, since he was with his first love for such a long time.

166
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:55.230
He's almost completely inexperienced at love. What an idiot!

167
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.290
What were we even expecting?

168
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.030
<i>[The joy of living alone]</i>

169
00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:31.830
♫ <i>Everyday, I find a light to make me shine</i> ♫

170
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:37.230

♫ <i> A sensation like falling in love </i> ♫

172
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.690

174

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.840
<i>So frustrating.</i>

181
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.130
<i>You're even blocking your daydreams?</i>

182
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.100
I'm hallucinating her now.

183
00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:24.760
<i>Exactly, that's just how sexually frustrated you are.</i>

184
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:29.350
I'm saying this because it's a hallucination.

185
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.500
This is me doing my best to hold back.

186
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.680
<i>Why are you holding back? I'm 39, not 19.</i>

187
00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.570
<i>Don't protect me.</i>

188
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.830
<i>We're both grown-ups, so having an R-rated scene is not a problem.</i>

189
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:48.370
Because we are adults, we should love each other for the rest of our lives.

190
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.250
Is it okay to have the type of love where it just burns for one moment?

191
00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.930
When I'm... continuously opening my heart and liking you.

192
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.310
Let's say I... kiss you,

193
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:02.930
then I'm not letting you go.

194
00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.490
<i>Why are you putting your life on the line for a kiss?</i>

195
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.080
<i>Where's the bedroom?</i>

196
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.350
Why the bedroom? No...

197
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.320
- So... where—? 
 <i>- Here?</i>

198
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.510
- Jang Hari? 
 <i>- Wow, this house is nice.</i>

199
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:23.840
Oh? You shouldn't do that.

200
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.860
Am I really sexually frustrated?

201
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.720
What's wrong with me?

202
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.690
- Choi Hyojoo... 
 - Yes?

203
00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.410
Weren't you supposed to photograph the cooking process for this piece?

204
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.340
It's such an easy recipe that I thought I'd just explain it in words.

205
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.570
Newbie moms don't know how finely they have to mince the meat and veggies.

206
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:54.700
Food sizes need to be different based on their children's age, so how can we not show pictures?

207
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.110
The food styling looks so nice,

208
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.200
I didn't want to make it look messy by including images of an incomplete dish...

209
00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.540
Do you think that I'm looking at you like this because I want to hear empty excuses?

210
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.260
I'll have it reshot.

211
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.320
Also, go to the Advertising Department and have them confirm the expiration on the toothpaste.

212
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.180
If you don't remind Director Kim, he'll just take it without checking.

213
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.460
What? Shouldn't she be grateful that someone as beautiful as me

214
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.650
even bothers to work here?

215
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:23.910
Reporter Choi!

216
00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.850
Are you having your meal? I'm on an errand.

217
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.090
Is something the matter?

218
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:35.260
You don't look too good.

219
00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.580
Did you get in trouble?

220
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.740
Of course not!

221
00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.760
You definitely got in trouble.

222
00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.310
You have a face like you've just been scolded.

223
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:50.040
Choikang Eutteum, would you kindly mind your own business?

224
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.210
If someone's not replying, that means they don't want to talk.

225
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:58.420
I'm sorry. I have no tact, right?

226
00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:03.510
You certainly don't. None at all. To a worrying degree.

227
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:08.340
If I come, just greet me. Okay?

228
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.840
Yes, I'll only just greet you from now on.

229
00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.930
Then, because it'll become burdensome, I'll leave now.

230
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.660
How dense.

231
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.770
Oh my gosh, this is crazy. Oh my, oh my. Ow!

232
00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:32.580
Oh my!

233
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.070
<i>If I come, just greet me. Okay?</i>

234
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.100
Fighting!

235
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.700
What is he doing not helping me?

236
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.850
Ugh, this is killing me!

237
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.120
I'm going to go crazy.

238
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.950
Fashionism is really against the rules.

239
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:17.010
<i>Why is it so dark in here?</i>

240
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.170
Why are you like that? Are you hurting somewhere?

241
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:29.710
I see her when I'm awake,

242
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.710
I see her when I'm asleep.

243
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.420
This is killing me.

244
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.930
What is it? Are you seeing things?

245
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.830
What's the matter?

246
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.960
Is it your eyes or your mind?

247
00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:49.740
I don't know whether my mind or my heart hurts.

248
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.690
All I know is that it hurts.

249
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.820
There's a song about that, how love is a disease of the heart.

250
00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.300
I really like Part II.

251
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.360
Why'd you come?

252
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.530
I'm really busy with photoshoots. There's an important one this afternoon with Jang Hari about infertile couples.

253
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.390
Could you... please take the job?

254
00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.570
You're kidding me.

255
00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:17.070
Why? Is it cause you think you'll hurt even more?

256
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:22.930
H-Hey!

257
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.280
Put clothes on. Now.

258
00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.620
This... Do the shoot instead of me.

259
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.780
It needs a picture of the product and one for the review.

260
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.610
Why me?

261
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:42.510
An excuse to go to the studio.

262
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.140
Mr. Han will be there.

263
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.270
Coincidentally, the original photographer is in the hospital.

264
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:49.190
What are you up to?

265
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:53.040
All I'm saying is that if you have "some,"

266
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.180
you've got to add a "thing" to get something.

267
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.030
Don't jump to conclusions and don't give me advice.

268
00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.970
Just drink some watermelon juice.

269
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.750
Did you hold hands?

270
00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.010
I said no.

271
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.200
- But you did hit on him? 
 - No!

272
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.510
Did you for sure send a signal?

273
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.820
Why are you guys so interested in my love life?

274
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.200
It's fun!

275
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:23.690
Oh, so you're bored. You don't have enough work to do with this feature, right?

276
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.110
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:29.250
Go. Work.

278
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.590
Stop it.

279
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.890
You're Han Yisang.

280
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:46.840
Don't break down. You can't.

281
00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:48.790
What are you doing?

282
00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:01.380
Wow, this is too much. You appeared again?

283
00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.670
And you can copy me now?

284
00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.410
W-W-Why?

285
00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.120
W-W-What are y—

286
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.550
I actually touched—what? You're a human?

287
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:31.160
I was greeting you since earlier.

288
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:34.050
Are you hurt somewhere?

289
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:39.440
Let's go inside.

290
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:52.700
Get a hold of yourself.

291
00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:10.880
A dating signal that works 100%.

292
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.320
Turn your head 45 degrees onto his shoulder.

293
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.160
Purse your lips towards the direction of the other's head.

294
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.660
Chief Han, let's talk for a bit...

295
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.390
Sure.

296
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.210
This. This... I'm not sure what angle this should be taken at.

297
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.980
I think we need to look at it in detail.

298
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.810
I think we can just follow it as is.

299
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.000
Right. We can just follow it as is, right?

300
00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.720
Oh, I'm tired.

301
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.070
I'm tired.

302
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:00.000
Y-You're tired?

303
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.640
Yes.

304
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.610
I'll take care of the shoot then, you... sleep a bit.

305
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:09.180
W-What?

306
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:17.140
Where did my camera go? Oh, it's here.

307
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:31.120
Oh, wow. Everyone's gone home already!

308
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:36.120
Nice!

309
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:38.670
What's this?

310
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.840
<i>This is a greeting for your feet to be comfortable.</i>

311
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.810
Ugh...

312
00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.170
Ah, this is so crappy.

313
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.870
Where'd he get these?

314
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.460
It says "9UCCI" instead of "GUCCI."

315
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.240
Ah... Is it not any good?

316
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:06.400
Can you not tell what my tastes are by looking at this?

317
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.130
Ah... there was Prada, too.

318
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.160
I should have bought that instead.

Ah, what for?

321
00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.420
First, you should wear these. Next time, I'll buy the Prada

322
00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.720
and Balenciaga, too. The two of them are 10,000 won.

323
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.900
No, it's okay. It's very burdensome. 
 <i>(T/N: She spoke with satoori/accent)</i>

324
00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.930
Ah...

325
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.750
I'll be satisfied with this.

326
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:37.230
Really?

327
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.110
This may not look it, but it's actually very useful.

328
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:44.420
Be quiet.

329
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:51.790
Wow! You look very luxurious right now.

330
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.700
Wow, I can even pull these off.

331
00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:58.990
I mean I guess a luxury product can make a person look like a luxury.

332
00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.080
It looks really good on you.

333
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.220
Wear this for a long time then. I'll be going.

334

337
00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:16.790
This is crappy. Not Gucci, but crappy.

338
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.920
This is really nice.

339
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.450
Oh my, is it a rare item?

340
00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:29.100
You're going to do the photoshoot, Han Yisang?

341
00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.400
Did you not see the schedule because you were asleep?

342
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.430
That's not it. Since it's a national, year-long program,

343
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.730
this project will probably be good for your career, too.

344
00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:42.130
What sweet words. Is it because you had a good night's sleep?

345
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:44.940
I didn't get a good night's sleep.

346
00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:50.160

How are you feeling?

354
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:14.640
I thought I would be okay since it's my second time, but I'm feeling double the anxiety.

355
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.840

Okay.

363

Yes.

365

A lot of people get fertility treatments,

so don't think you're the only ones having a hard time.

Okay.

Are you curious about anything?

370

Are there any medicines that she needs to be careful of?

371
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.780
The vitamin assortments are okay.

372

You will need to tell me beforehand about any other medicine.

<i>(T/N: folic acid is usually taken by pregnant women and women who want to get pregnant. Helps to prevent major birth defects)</i>

Yes.

Well, you can be by her side.

379
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:55.170
I hope they succeed.

380
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.430
Should they forcefully make one when it's that difficult?

381
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.370
There's so much sacrifice.

382
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:07.220
For a nonexistent being.

383
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.280
Look over there.

384
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.710
How could they make that kind of expression?

385
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:31.770
If you look at a mother looking at her baby,

386
00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.520
isn't it very fascinating?

387
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.420
How much love could a person have

388
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.370
that they're able to smile like that?

389
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:43.500
A person to another person,

390
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.400
without any greed,

391
00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.610
could give such a kind love?

392
00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:00.070
The fact that there's a being that you can love like that,

393
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:03.500
one wouldn't feel lonely in their lives...

394
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.670
So between someone they love

395
00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:11.100
and the baby, if they had to choose one...

396
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:15.700
Do women, no matter what, pick the baby?

397
00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.710
The person they love.

398
00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.870
I won't let go of him.

399
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:30.260
Although the baby is a miracle,

400
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.560
for me who couldn't find someone to love for over 10 years,

401
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.960
love is also a miracle.

402
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.990
In order to help you and Doha,

403
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:53.350
I brought all the popular infant-care items.

404
00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:57.670
Because babies have sensitive skin, you need to wash them in clean water without any bacteria.

405
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:02.260
Since you're starting a new chapter in your life, become a new person by cleansing well with clean water.

406
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.160
Use it well, and all you have to do is take a photo to help recommend it.

407
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.290
No... You lack sincerity in your scams.

408
00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.820
Even if it's to keep on bringing home the best test products,

409
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.870
you'll feel my sincerity.

410
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.470
Is that so? Then give it.

411
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.640
What are you doing?

412
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.330
Why won't you give it to me? I said give it!

413
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.690
Why are you holding on to it so tightly? Just stay this way forever then!

414
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:50.270
I put it on earlier!

415

All at once.

416
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:56.900
Is that so? You're turning 40 soon but you're so tiny and... and...

417
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.700
you just fit right into my chest and right into one arm! What am I supposed to do then?

418
00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.500
You should do some shoulder exercises and increase your strength!

419
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.040
What are you wanting me to do? Are you wanting me to hit you? Do you want to die today?

420
00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.050
Doha, let's take a bath.

421
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.140
It's warm, right?

422
00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.800
Oh, how cute.

I'm acting naturally for your picture of the baby.

425
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:22.570
Just do what you normally do. Don't look at the camera.

426
00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:24.640
Doha, close your ears.

427
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:30.360
I've never done a bath with the mom. What do you mean just do what I do normally?

Have a look at this one too. He'll come down with something, too, just you watch.

485
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:13.080

Oh, so now you want to be friends?

492

Think about what you've done.

493
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:34.830
What kind of friend cuts all ties because he's getting married?

494

Yes, not only did it have my personal details, but even the name of the magazine and the company.

Don't look at those comments.

If you need anything, let me know.

Sure, for help around the home, but for work-related issues, colleagues are best.

Tell me, your colleague, if you need any help.

564
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:29.990
That means you've just neatly defined your relationship as just "colleagues," right?

Oh, no, we've been colleagues all along.

566

I think you also need to clarify where you stand and the nature of your relationship with Hari.

567

I've already told you, we're people who live together.  That's where we stand.

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.540
I can pay. Why not? It's okay. Do it with this—

583
00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.020
No, I don't feed off of someone younger.

584
00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:44.620
I'm probably older than you financially.

585
00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.760
I wasn't going to say this...

586

I'm... someone who lives in an apartment that overlooks the Han River.

Wow...

588
00:43:57.840 --> 00:44:03.100
I'm a doctor. My potential earnings are just... something else.

Oh...

590
00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.210
I'll buy it. It's only 53,000 won. Here you go.

591
00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:12.150
- It is her. It's her. 
 - I told you.

You need a man, right?

602
00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.100
If you want to go and see your wife in one piece, let go of this hand.

Wow, look at her playing hard to get in her state! Cute!

604
00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:02.610
I had three kids... at once at that! So, believe in me and let's go drink some wine and—

Do this properly!  You're filthy!

606
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:12.630
This can be considered sexual harassment! Making me feel bad about my body is assault, too! What is this?

607

Who are you? Why are you making my desperation into an embarrassment?

Hey, it's obvious that I'm the victim.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:35.070
Now look here, sirs.

634
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:37.120
We saw this.

635
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.340
If you look into it, you'll see.

636
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:41.500
It's all over the internet.

637
00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:44.090
We just saw it on the internet.

638
00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.690
So, we just pretended to know her. We did just

639
00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.200
a bit, but that woman... to me...

640
00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.950
she like hit me, kicked me, and swung her bag at me...

641
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:55.340
That's why, to that crazy sperm lady, I—

642
00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:57.370
Don't do it.

643
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:02.620
Let's just go.

644
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:12.290
Sir, hold it back.

645
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.550
He's not even worth this.

646
00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.490
Restrain yourself.

647
00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:35.020
No need to feel bad because of those immature jerks.

648
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.620
You did nothing wrong.

649
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:38.950
He's right!

650
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:42.650
Deputy Editor, you did absolutely nothing wrong.

651
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:02.420
Escorting me all the way home, of all things...

652
00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.580
Well, we followed you because we felt bad.

653
00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.770
Yeah, that's right.

654
00:48:07.770 --> 00:48:11.850
It was an opportunity that I could have used my muscles in a long time.

655
00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:14.580
But... it wasn't needed.

656
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:20.680
It was an opportunity for me to show off my intelligence. It wasn't easy!

657
00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:25.800
Deputy Editor, look at this.

658
00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.430
That jerk from earlier. Shall I report him?

659
00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:37.010
Did you come from an art college? You draw well.

660
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.930
You draw well.

661
00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:42.740
If you're all so funny like this, it'll be too easy for me to brush it off and get a good night's rest.

662
00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:46.900
Thank you. Really, thank you.

663
00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:49.420
Go back safely.

664
00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.400
Go in.

665
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.690
Thank you, everybody. Really, thank you.

666
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:54.410
Go inside.

667
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.670
- Why? 
 - Just go on up.

668
00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.670
- You should've come in later. 
 - Aunt will wake up if the front door opens and closes twice.

669
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:03.220
- You can just open it slowly. 
 - I'll leave your house, gosh.

670
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:05.420
Goodness...

671
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:15.710
They really do live together. Maybe it's cohabitation?

672
00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.100
It's probably just between a male and a female friend.

673
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:26.240
The deputy editor looks small today of all days.

674
00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.180
I think I'm going to need to protect her a bit more now on.

675
00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:34.820
Shall we go?

676
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:53.250
<i>Open up!</i>

677
00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:55.790
<i>It's urgent!</i>

678
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:58.400
<i>Hurry up!</i>

679
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.420
Tada.

680
00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:13.140
♫<i> When I'm sad, I look at comic books</i> ♫

681
00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:25.190
Shall I leave a comment somewhere saying you're not that type of person?

682
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:30.410
It's okay. It's not like someone will understand me.

683
00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:39.220
I have the finances and the confidence to raise a child.

684
00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:43.840
But because I'm single, there's no way for me to get a child if I'm not married.

685
00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:49.720
Even so, I don't have a man or the confidence to get married.

686
00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:54.960
If I say that, how many people do you think will understand me?

687
00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:57.670
It'll be hard even after 40 years.

688
00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.780
Don't blame yourself.

689
00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:08.220
And no matter the reason, no one deserves to be doxxed and badmouthed.

690
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:10.160
No one.

691
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.960
I found out for certain who is on my side through this event.

692
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.890
So it's fine.

693
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.620
Yeah.

694
00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:39.200
Aigoo, our Doha...

695
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.820
You were scared being alone, right?

696
00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.990
Is that so, Doha?

697
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.970
I know.  It's okay.

698
00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:50.040
I know, I know. It's all right.

699
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.550
When did you get scared?

700
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.430
Jang Hari.

701
00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.450
Do you want to marry me?

702
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:04.410
Jang Hari.

703
00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.380
Do you want to marry me?

704
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.030
Doha's father, get a babysitter by paying them.

705
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:23.730
It's hard to get a sperm donor, so why don't you raise Doha like a daughter?

706
00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:27.060
Can you get rid of that dirty stare?

707
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.800
Why would you let go of the easy road and go around it?

708
00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:34.000
It's an easy road for you. I don't need a man.

709
00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.870
Am I a man?

710
00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.970
Well, then shall I see you as a woman?

711
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:48.520
Big Sis Jaeyoung? Big Sis?

712
00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.160
<i>Everyone, let's take a picture here!</i>

713
00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.860
<i>Got it.</i>

714
00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:00.430
<i>Come on over here, quickly.</i>

715
00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:02.120
<i>This way, please.</i>

716
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.400
<i>Okay, gather around.</i>

717
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:06.370
<i>It looks good. The weather is nice, too.</i>

718
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.380
<i>[How is This Possible - Sperm Woman]</i>

<i>Okay!</i>

724
00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.730
Today's weather is so nice.

725
00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:19.950
Excuse me.

726
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:23.360
Your daughter is Jang Hari, the magazine editor?

727
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.430
Why makes you bring her up?

728
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:29.590
It's just that my daughter was saying your daughter's on the internet.

729
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:33.320
Occasionally something she writes shows up online since she's a reporter.

730
00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.500
That's just part of being a journalist. She's not famous or anything.

731
00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:38.970
That's not right! She said your daughter was definitely famous.

732
00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:43.720
"Sperm woman" or something?

733
00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:48.970
She should be focused on getting a man, not buying sperm. Is there something wrong with her?

734
00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:50.880
What did I say?

735
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.470
I told you to intervene when she was saying all that nonsense about being too focused on becoming a reporter to date.

736
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.630
Really, it's unbelievable, still being unmarried at that age...

737
00:53:57.630 --> 00:54:01.430
It's not something punishable by law but that's basically a crime.

738
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:04.880
What is she going to do? Now she definitely can't get married.

739
00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:08.620
Who do you think you are, calling my daughter a criminal and poking your nose into her business!

740
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.760
<i>What's wrong with this lady?</i>

741
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.220
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

742
00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.990
<i>Grab on to her!</i>

743
00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.580
Why? You can't go inside?

744
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.960
Chief Bom called me over at this hour.

745
00:54:53.960 --> 00:55:00.130
There's no reason she would've done it to help me avoid others. It must mean it's something serious.

746
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.500
I'm a little scared.

747
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:09.490
I can't go inside in your stead, but I can show you this.

748
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.320
Wait a sec. Tada!

749
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:18.830
What do you think of the main cut?

750
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:23.100
It's very reliable.

751
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:27.230
Although I'll get in trouble today, I'll get compliments tomorrow.

752
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.780
I wanted to go with you to develop the photos.

753
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.360
Next time.

754
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.250
Next time, for sure... let's go together.

755
00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:41.830
Okay.

756
00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:46.560
Next time.

757
00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:09.490
The chairman wants the sperm lady to apologize.

758
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:15.700
Because of the protest from our readers, the president has a mountain of worries.

759
00:56:15.700 --> 00:56:20.590
Issue a statement of apology.

760
00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:24.850
She's the victim, so why should she apologize?

761
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:27.230
It's become a big problem!

762
00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:31.440
The culpable party needs to offer some kind of explanation and apologize to the readers!

763
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:33.810
It's a personal problem.

764
00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:36.420
I'm against making it the magazine's problem.

765
00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:39.730
I don't want to waste publication space on lame excuses.

766
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.790
It's not a lame excuse!

767
00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:46.000
But a sincere apology to alleviate the protests of the readers!

768
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.790
You're not understanding what I'm saying...

769
00:56:52.590 --> 00:56:56.860
I know very well that it's my fault.

770
00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:06.510
I understand well that I disappointed the readers, and that the company has suffered from the drop in our magazine's reputation.

771
00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.270
I'm very sorry.

772
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:17.210
But just because I apologize, will the readers who left come back?

773
00:57:17.210 --> 00:57:20.080
I will take responsibility.

774
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:26.860
How?

775
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:30.930
I'm going to try and get the disappointed readers to understand.

776
00:57:30.930 --> 00:57:32.820
Understand?

777
00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.960
This is an order, not a request.

778
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:42.880
I said to quiet down the readers!

779
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:45.980
It affects how many advertisements we get!

780
00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:52.350
If profits decline, will I face disciplinary action again?

781
00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:54.030
No.

782
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.470
This time you'll be fired.

783
00:58:04.750 --> 00:58:06.210
What should I do?

784
00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:09.180
Why are you asking me? Am I taking responsibility?

785
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:13.970
Hurry and decide. Is the editor's column going to be written or not?

786
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:18.780
He said I'll be fired. Give me some time.

787
00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:23.020
- I have to go home and let my husband off child-duty. Go home. 
 - Okay.

788
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:29.490
Don't trust the vice president.

789
00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.960
He's also a bastard.

790
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.520
Hello, baby!

791
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:39.910
