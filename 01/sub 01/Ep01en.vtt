Almost done, Sir! I brought too many of the World Classics.

162
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.180

I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

Classmate, I'm sorry for taking so much of your time. Let me treat you to milk tea.

169
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.210
No need.

170
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:17.260
You don't need to be so polite. My mom told me not to trouble others without giving anything in return.

Sorry.

Say, Zhou Xiao, this child, isn't she too unreasonable?

176
00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:58.360
We said we would take her to school, but she just went on her own.

She just left a note, it said

"Mom, I'm going to go register by myself. Just let me venture into the world."

179
00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.780
Venture into the world? Go where? To cause trouble?

Can you rest your mouth for a bit? You've been talking for two hours now.

Auntie, this isn't right. My mom didn't give Zhou Xiao a red envelope either.

193
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:28.630
Oh, these are toothpicks. I'm afraid it might get caught in between your teeth.

You seem to be prejudiced towards forensic science.

It's not that. Don't you think a forensic scientist is perfect for a perverted killer character?

If there's no problem, I'll write it for you tonight.

296

It's pretty comprehensive, but you should take note

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:55.210
death by aconitine poisoning happens very rarely.

298
00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:58.520
But it's also precisely this that we need to be extra careful.

299
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.120
We can't rashly eliminate the probability of suicide or homicide.

300
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.260
Okay, I will pay attention to that.

301
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.150
Just write according to what is listed in this outline.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:32.290
You can go. Go.

307
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:36.310

308
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.550
Okay, I know.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.870
<i>- Wrong again!</i>
- Xiao Zhou.
<i>(T/N: Xiao meaning little is used as an endearment)</i>

310
00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:47.010
Y-You come here and teach me how to play this.

311
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:52.670
I'm not playing, I'm...

312
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:56.190
practicing for experiments.

313
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.200
Right.

314
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.390
This was mailed to me by one of my former students.

315
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:08.990
It looks easy but it's not really.

316
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.250
I haven't been able to do it all morning.

317
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.490
<i>Terrific! Terrific!</i>

318
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:30.950
Professor, I'm leaving.

319
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:33.870
Okay, you can go.

320
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:39.860
Right! Remember to find time and bring over the teaching material. I'm going to use it tomorrow.

321
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.500
Got it.

322
00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.660
How talented.

323
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.630
Is anyone there? No?

324
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.680
Fine.

325
00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.330
Classmate, wait a moment!

326
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.870
Hey, why is it you again?

327
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:14.480
I should be the one asking you that.

328
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.120
Wait, wait!

329
00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:23.950
Classmate, my hair is stuck in the umbrella. Can you help me get it out?

330
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.750
Don't move.

331
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.630
Be gentler.

332
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:56.820
Thank you.

333
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.080
Thank you!

334
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:04.690
<i>[Joint Registration Area]</i>

335
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.260
Fanzhou, you're here.

336
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.250
Excuse me.

337
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.210
You're finally here.

338
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.340
Why are you here?

339
00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:29.030
She came to register. She said she was your neighbor growing up.

340
00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.760
I didn't see you coming so I dragged her over to do manual labor.

341
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.850
This does count as manual labor. I didn't have anything else to do anyway.

342
00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.400
Why were you looking for me?

343
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.900
I didn't see you go home all summer so I thought to come and wait for you.

344
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.860
I was doing experiments with the professor all summer.

345
00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.400
Stamp it.

346
00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.980
After you put away your luggage, you can go to Building 2.

347
00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.030
The second floor to get your books.

348
00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:02.420
Hello, Mom?

349
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.600
<i> My phone can't go on the internet. I'm really bored. </i>

350
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.220
I'm busy right now. I'll call you later.

351
00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.330
<i> How long will that be? I'll call you again. </i>

352
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.990
I'll call you when I'm done.

353
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:17.410
<i> You don't pay attention to me. </i>

354
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:19.050
Bye-bye.

355
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.740
Put away your luggage and remember to go get your books.

356
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:30.100
Next.

357
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.730
Fanzhou.

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.910
Thank you.

Chinese Department.

360
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.260
Isn't he the one you forwarded to me.

361
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.590
The Southern University's "campus grass" (T/N: best looking guy on campus)? In the Forensic Science Department?

362
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:48.760
It's him. It's him!

363
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.980
Look at his hands. He's actually wiping his hands.

364
00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.820
- For someone with a hand fetish like me, I'm about to faint.
 - His hands...

365
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.690
must look so cool holding a scalpel.

366
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.300
My God, he's too handsome.

367
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.200
<i>So he's a forensic science major.</i>

368
00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:05.970
<i>I even offended him. Is he going to cut me open?</i>

369
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:38.560
Zhou Xiao!

370
00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.190
- Tao Ling! 
 - What's wrong with you? I called you all morning and you didn't pick up.

371
00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.880
It's my fault, it's my fault. You can stand in front of me.

372
00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.720
The situation is too complicated! I'll tell you slowly when we go back to our dorm.

373
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.570
Let me finish reading this "Journey Under the Midnight Sun" peacefully first, okay?

374
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.050
Is it that good?

375
00:29:57.050 --> 00:30:00.100
It really is! I can let you borrow it after I'm done.

376
00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.490
No need, you know I don't like reading.

377
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.240
I've bothered you.

378
00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:12.510
- Do you want to drink it? 
 - No.

379
00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:23.860
What are you looking at?

380
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.130
Which one is our daughter's?

381
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.480
How should I know? Why don't you just wipe all of them?

382
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.860
Uncle. Auntie. Why don't I help you guys?

383
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.510
- No need, no need. Just stay there and eat the pig trotters. Eat.
- No need.

384
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.780
You just need to write down your name.

385
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.200
In a bit, go to Dorm 1's room 102

386
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.500
and then go to Building 1 to get your books.
<i>[Mom]</i>

Zhou Xiao, why are you crying?

388
00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.730
The is so touching. Keigo Higashino's books are too good.

389
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.840
Also, don't you think the vibration of a phone, sounds like farting?

390
00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.570
Listen.

391
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:16.740
<i> This girl goes from crying to laughing so quickly. </i>

392
00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.800
Classmate.

393
00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.590
- It's your turn. 
- Sorry about that.

394
00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.730
My name is Zhou Xiao, in the Chinese Department.

395
00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.330
Hello, Mom.

396
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:34.350
First, go to settings.

397
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.950
Click on "cellular network."

398
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.360
Inside there's a "cellular data."

399
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.900
Did you click on it?

400
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.500
<i> Why does Fanzhou keep looking at that girl? </i>

401

00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.350
Bye-bye.

403
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.100
Remember to get your books.

404

<i>Zhou Xiao?</i>

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.420
- Sorry. 
 - You guys are...?

407
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:13.080
Oh, we are your roommate Zhou Xiao's

408
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.970
mom and dad. We're helping you guys clean.

409
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.550
And you are?

410
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.740
Hello, I'm Zhu Lu.

411
00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.290
Oh, Zhu Lu. Have you eaten yet?

412
00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:24.440
I have pig trotters over there. Do you want to eat some?

413
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.370
No thanks.

414
00:32:30.090 --> 00:32:33.000
May I ask... Who did this?

415
00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.030
Not-Not me.

416
00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:39.960
I did. Young lady, I did it. Earlier I used the water

417
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:43.100
to clean the bed and it might've accidentally dripped onto it.

418
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.090
- I'm sorry.
- Here, here.

419
00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.760
Auntie will help you wipe it.

420
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.960
You can't wipe gouache when it's wet.

421
00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.740
This Cai Yasi is so lazy. He just left your luggage with dorm management.

422
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.690
What-What's going on?

423
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.390
Hello, Professor, I'm sorry.

424
00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.880
The paintings you wanted me to help you frame...

425
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.660
there's one that accidentally got wet.

426
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.820
I'm really sorry. Is there a way to fix it?

427
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.330
Okay. I'll come over right now.

428
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.020
Mom!

429
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.670
What is it? Why are you pushing me? Don't you want to spend more time with your mom?

430
00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:46.870
- It's not that. 
 - Also, I didn't even deal with you for all the great things you did today.

431
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:50.060
I already apologized a hundred times to you today.

432
00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:53.230
Fine, fine. I'll just tell you a few more things.

433
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:55.790
After that, I'll leave, all right?

434
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.060
Let me tell you. The one in your dorm, Zhu... What's her name?

435
00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.130
- Zhu Lu! 
 - Zhu Lu.

436
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:04.540
Don't get into conflicts with her. She doesn't look like she can be trifled with, understand?

437
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.010
Why do you think that? Don't talk about them like that behind their backs.

438
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.050
- You silly child! 
 - Let's get in the car.

439
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.700
Fine, fine. I know.

440
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:14.380
I know. Your bag!

441
00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.920
Fine, fine.

442
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.770
- Remember. Don't eat cold food and stay up late. 
 - Don't worry!

443
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.530
- October 1, you must come home.
- I will.
- Must come home, okay?

444
00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.130
Definitely! All right, all right.

445
00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.460
- Call us often. 
 - Don't worry.

446
00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.280
- Dad, drive safe. 
 - All right!

447
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.210
Don't play with your phone too much. Don't stay up so late.

448
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:36.690
Okay, be careful.

449
00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.840
- Bye-bye.

Wait, wait. Almost.

 - Almost done.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.870
"You can dig a whole bag-full. You can dig a whole bag-full."

467
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.360
You can say it like that!

468
00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.750
It'll sound more like when you say it faster. "Where should I dig for potatoes? Dig for potatoes in the suburbs. You can dig a whole bag-full. You can dig a whole bag-full."

469
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.130
It'll sound just like Japanese. I learned it watching stand-up comedy with my dad.

470
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.470
You're amazing!

471
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.700
You scared me to death!

472
00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.640
Tao Ling, do you have a grudge with fried food?

473
00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:29.200
My mom never lets me eat this at home, and it wasn't easy to escape from her grasp.

474
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.290
I must avenge my diet.

475
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.370
Milk tea in my mom's eyes is like insecticide.

476
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:36.720
- So you were feeding me insecticide?
- Are you going to drink it or not?

477
00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.910
- I'll drink. 
 - Drink.

478
00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:45.120
What about you? What were you not allowed to eat?

479
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.450
My grandpa says to eat a bowl of millet porridge every day for the good of the stomach.

480
00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.520
We're now beyond the reach of those enforcers. Why are you still so obedient? 
<i>(T/N: lit. the mountain is high and the emperor is far away)</i>

481
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.100
It makes it look like the two of us are very unfilial.

482
00:36:57.530 --> 00:37:00.000
Your millet porridge looks pretty good.

483
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.630
Can I have a taste?

484
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:14.800
It doesn't taste like anything.

485
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.250
Luo Wei, do you know?

486
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.910
Tao Ling's nickname from high school has been "Taste-a-bit."

487
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.200
She wants a taste of anything she sees. It's annoying.

488
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.370
Yeah, yeah. To be honest, I've had my eyes on your sweet potato chips for quite a while.

489
00:37:29.370 --> 00:37:32.670
It looks really good! Can you let me have some when we go back?

490
00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.350
Sure, I'll give you a big bag.

491
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.810
Then I want some, too!

492
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.280
Zhou Xiao, don't leech off Wei-wei's sweet potato chips.

493
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.830
You're the only one out of us three with an income. You have to support us!

494
00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:44.410
How do I have an income?

495
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:45.830
You're writing novels right now!

496
00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:47.740
I heard authors make a lot of money.

497
00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.810
Tell me!  Did you make money?

498
00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.760
I did make a bit.

499
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.610
How much?

500
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.800
¥82.
 <i>(approximately $11.65)</i>

501
00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:57.570
In one day? That much?

502
00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.580
Two months.

503
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:06.690
What kind of expression is that? The beginning is always hard.

504
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.080
Then, what kind of novels do you write?

505
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.820
Forensic science. It's such a coincidence that our school has a Forensic Science department.

506
00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.170
I've been having writer's block lately.

507
00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:20.830
I'm already excited to go investigate!

508
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:37.450
What is this? It looks so cool.

509
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.590
<i> Why is it her again? </i>

510
00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.490
Come out. How long are you going to keep hiding?

511
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:08.790
I didn't see anything. Please be gracious and let me go.

512
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.430
Then go.

513
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.230
I-It's you?

514
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.760
So you were moving the teaching material just now?

515
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.130
Otherwise?

516
00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:34.280
I thought I entered a crime scene.

517
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.090
Don't play anymore. Give it back to me.

518
00:41:37.090 --> 00:41:39.320
W-Why are you...

519
00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.860
What? I can't go in?

520
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.580
So petty! You won't let me in when the door isn't even closed.

521
00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.750
I should be the one asking you how you got in earlier.

522
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.090
The door wasn't locked.

523
00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.500
Got it. You should leave.

524
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.320
Wait!

525
00:42:13.690 --> 00:42:16.330
There's going to be a day when you beg me to go in and I won't!

526
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.270
<i>Mom.</i>

527
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.250
After we left,

528
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:36.010
did you cry?

529
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:37.200
No.

530
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:41.160
Don't cry later either. Don't embarrass yourself in front of your classmates.

531
00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.920
<i>I'll try to hold it in.</i>

532
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.070
Hold it in?

533
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:48.210
Daughter, listen to your mom.

534
00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.660
When are you going to military training?

535
00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:51.370
Yeah, when's the military training?

536
00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:54.180
I think it's the day after tomorrow.

537
00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.690
We're not by your side. Drink more water and don't stay up late.

538
00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.270
Also, don't drink beverages and milk tea.

539
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:03.270
Those are not healthy and aren't good for the body.

540
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:05.780
Don't worry, I'll give them all up.

541
00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.520
Rest early. Bye, Mom and Dad.

542
00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.930
You should go to bed early, too.

543
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.930
She already hung up. What are you doing?

544
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.410
You're crying?

545
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:28.870
She's just going to college. It's not like she's getting married. Do you have to be like this?

546
00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:38.200
Don't laugh at me if I say it.

547
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.890
Do you miss home a little?

548
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:45.200
To be honest,

549
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.830
I've already held it in for a long time.

550
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.610
I also miss my grandpa.

551
