33
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.200
Sir Tang.

34
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320
What are you looking at?

35
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.200
Wife has said

36
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.490
she's going to pack her things and come home with me.

37
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.060
Sir Tang,

38
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.950
I really didn't want to report you today.

39
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.660
Truthfully, Er Tong couldn't tolerate it and wanted to vent anger on my behalf.

40
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.900
I also know that everything you said in the court today

41
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.340
was for expediency. That old crook used my life to threaten you.

42
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.260
You didn't admit your relationship with my wife

43
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.820
out of loyalty.

44
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.860
You think too much.

45
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.440
Zong Yinglin already planned for every possibility.

46
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.180
He would be able to punish you regardless of what we chose.

47
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.500
It's just not fair on her.

48
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.830
I understand, I understand. In order to ensure we did not get beaten,

49
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.010
you've been unjustly treated. I will remember your kindness.

50
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.030
I'm sorry for today.

51
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.990
I don't have anything to give you as repayment,

52
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.230
except this money.

53
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.600
You actually accepted it?

54
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.790
I thought you were an honest official?

55
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.740
Arranging settlements for the refugees requires money.

56
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.170
It's fine if you accept it, too. Now you've accepted it,

57
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.160
I can peacefully take my wife away.

58
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.960
She agreed?

59
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.990
<i>[Virtuous Mountain] </i>

60
00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.830
Yes.

61
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.430
Sir Tang, today I'll tell you something from the bottom of my heart.

62
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.990
I know you have deep feelings for each other.

63
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.480
But Zong Yinglin that old thief has his eyes set on her.

64
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.020
Even if there wasn't the situation with Er Tong this time,

65
00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.520
he will have a next time. He will have unlimited times!

66
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.900
Time and time again,

67
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.870
she hurt both physically

68
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.520
and emotionally.

69
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.610
I see it with my eyes and

70
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.930
it hurts me in my heart.

71
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.010
I can't say it aloud. You can save her once.

72
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.640
How many more times can you save her?

73
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.590
It'll only by leaving this troubled place

74
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.730
that we can stay alive, Sir Tang.

75
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.430
What you said makes sense.

76
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.630
I know. You may be saying this

77
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.740
but in your heart, you think I'm taking advantage of her difficulties.

78
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.300
I don't care if you believe it or not.

79
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.160
This time...

80
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.940
I really don't have any other intentions.

81
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.110
I just hope

82
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.620
that she can be safe and unharmed,

83
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.440
happy, and joyful every day.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.190
Sister Lingyin, Boss Zhu sent over some iced porridge.

94
00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.570
The temperature is just right so

95
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.740
I brought it for you. Eat some.

96
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.140
I don't want to eat. You should eat it.

97
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.440
Sister Lingyin,

98
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.740
are you actually planning on leaving?

99
00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.430
Leave.

100
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.860
During your time in Tongling,

101
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.040
your archery skills have been neglected.

102
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.940
What's going on? Your expression looks so sour.

103
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.040
Have you been defeated?

104
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.650
Since Adviser isn't here right now, why don't we... take Baba—

105
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.450
No way!

106
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.570
I always thought

107
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.970
that all things on Earth had an explanation.

108
00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.180
But she is the only person

109
00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.220
that I can't figure out or keep by my side.

110
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.270
I always feel like I can't catch her.

111
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.510
Don't worry. Adviser Tan is only being impulsive.

112
00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.010
Wait until she's thought it through, then it'll be fine if you talk to her.

113
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.320
I hope so.

114
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.000
Oh yeah.

115
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.340
Has Zong Yinglin left Tongling?

116
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:23.750
He left ages ago. I asked Cong Shun to escort him.

117
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.980
This old thief, Zong Yinglin. He's always making surprise attacks

118
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.070
in order to catch you unawares. One of these days,

119
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.860
I will brutally punish him.

120
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.540
There's no rush.

121
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.700
His debt... we'll settle it slowly.

122
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:15.580
- It's you. 
 - Are you waiting for Head Constable Zheng or Sir Tang?

123
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.980
It has nothing to do with you.

124
00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.170
This disguise suits you very well.

125
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.190
Won't it be a waste to give up like this?

126
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.090
A thousand facades are not worth a single sincere heart.

127
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.090
No matter how good your acting is, you can never truly be yourself.

128
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.080
Miss Jiang, you should empathize with this.

129
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.620
I never pretend. In order to face a thousand people, you need a thousand faces.

130
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.540
Only that way will you protect yourself.

131
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.760
I'm afraid that protecting yourself is not your only goal.

132
00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.220
I know... you are a loyal person.

133
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.800
You will protect Sir Zong

134
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.300
even if you sacrifice yourself.

135
00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.490
But I advise you to reconsider it.

136
00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.870
Those who made a mistake,

137
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:05.490
won't have a chance to turn back time.

138
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.600
Only by fighting to the death,

139
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.140
will you have a path for survival.

140
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.500
Magistrate Assistant Zhou, 
<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

141
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.220
what do you think about Sir Zong's sudden visit to Tongling?

142
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.580
Are you referring to you being falsely accused of adultery?

143
00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.560
Sir Zong undoubtedly has relations to the gold case.

144
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.870
Naturally, you know this.

145
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.230
Previously, I wanted to persuade him to work for me.

146
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.860
But I find his actions yesterday extremely confusing.

147
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:05.770
Sir, adultery is a private matter that authorities don't investigate if the citizens don't report it.

148
00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.460
It's normal for Sir Zong to appear to act on it

149
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.300
since someone reported it.

150
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.670
Furthermore, he did let you off

151
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.510
and didn't use this as a reason to punish you.

152
00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.790
In my opinion, Sir Zong has intentions to surrender.

153
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.860
You never had your own opinion on anything before.

154
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.990
But you sure have a clear perspective

155
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.820
on this matter.

156
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.740
The concept of a wise man who understands and submits to the circumstances is

157
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.910
something Sir Zong must understand.

158
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.760
A wise man understands and submits to the circumstances.

159
00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.900
Nicely said.

160

Do you understand it?

162
00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:50.110
I... don't know what you mean?

163
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.300
People who have an innocent nature

164
00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.590
always like to torment themselves and don't like to rely on others.

165
00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.270
Actually, there's nothing embarrassing about relying on others.

166
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:03.530
For instance, Tan Lingyin and I.

167
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:08.240
With her here, regardless of the numerous demons and ghosts in Tongling,

168
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.420
I can still act as if spring is in the air.

169
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:13.430
So, Magistrate Assistant Zhou,

170
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.680
is there someone in your heart that you can rely on?

171
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.960
A blossoming flower can have two sides.

172
00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.070
In a life, one can choose heaven or hell.

173
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:29.980
You are a smart person.

174
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.900
I trust that you have your own decisions.

175
00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.570
Also, why were you looking for me today?

176
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.570
It's... It's nothing.

177
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.300
If Sir doesn't have anything else to say, I'm going to leave first.

178
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.870
Okay.

I need to vent since I've been hurt by an unfaithful lover.

183
00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:39.300
Then why don't you go out for a bit? Zhu Dacong is outside.

184
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.110
Qingchen,

185
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.260
although I've broken up with Mr. Tang,

186
00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.490
it doesn't mean I should just settle down casually.

187
00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:49.340
That's not what I meant.

188
00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:53.320
It's just that today is the last day of the three-month deadline.

189

Even though you might not be able to use Sir Tang as a shield anymore,

190

Zhu Dacong's infatuation still needs to be dealt with.

But I am not in the mood today.

194
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.190
I don't want to deal with him.

195
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.190
Older Sister,

196
00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:27.330
Sir Tang would probably die of anger

197
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.670
if he knew you were going to meet Zhu Dacong.

198

Yet, I still held onto some hope.

322
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.780
You can definitely find someone more suitable.

323
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.880
Did you know?

324
00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.820
There's only one of your sister.

325
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.670
Only one.

326
00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.440
Qingchen,

327
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.260
I'm very sad.

328
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.180
Very sad.

329
00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.410
Brother Zhu,

330
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.130
calm down first.

331
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.050
Get some peace and quiet.

332
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.020
I will go look for my sister.

333
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.590
Sister Lingyin, there was a letter addressed to you left at the door.

334
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.880
Did you see who sent it?

335
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.640
- No. 
 - No.

336
00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:29.220
<i>[Tan Lingyin, I have Tan Qingchen in my hands. You must bring me 2,000 taels and also personally tell Tang Tianyuan that you are the spy; otherwise, Tan Qingchen will die.]</i>

337
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.400
What does it say, Sister Lingyin?

338
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.090
Why do you look so anxious?

339
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:38.980
Qingchen...

340
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.710
Miss Jiang?

341
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.070
Why did you kidnap me?

342
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:25.120
Unless you want to use me in order to make my sister leave Sir Tang?

343
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.320
What do you think?

344
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.580
Why don't you search yourself for the reason?

345
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.450
Then, this is strange.

346
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.460
There are no grudges between us.

347
00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:38.630
What is this for?

348
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.530
It makes sense.

349
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.670
It's already been twelve years.

350
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.110
You probably don't remember.

351
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:50.330
But we've been living in fear for twelve years.

352
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.880
I don't know what you are saying.

353
00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:59.510
Then I'll give you another hint.

354
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.650
That year you were five. There was a midsummer drought.

355
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.010
There wasn't a single source of water in the forest.

356
00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:08.910
You hid in the mountains for three days.

357
00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.330
Someone kept chasing you.

358
00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.820
<i>You really have to hide well this time.</i>

359
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.480
<i>Go.</i>

360
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.710
<i>Jiang Rendong, stop crying!</i>

361
00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.310
<i>Listen well. My Jiang family has been officials for four reigning emperors.</i>

362
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:35.440
<i>We've accumulated plenty and have wide-ranging connections. </i>

363
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:38.880
<i>You are the only one standing between the emperor and the world.</i>

364
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.720
<i>So what if you were reprimanded by the emperor?</i>

365
00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.100
<i>As long as you put up with hardships,</i>

366
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.250
<i>in two years, Father will have acquired the power to command the army.</i>

367
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.940
<i>At that time, you'll see who has the final say on this earth.</i>

368
00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.140
<i>Don't kill me, I beg you. Don't kill me.<i></i></i>

369
00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.290
<i>Don't blame me.</i>

370
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.420
<i>If you want to blame anyone, blame your sister.</i>

371
00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:02.830
<i>Sister lives a quiet and peaceful life.</i>

372
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:06.040
<i>She's detached from worldly affairs. She would never hurt anyone.</i>

373
00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.330
<i>It's because you went somewhere that you shouldn't have,</i>

374
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.180
<i>and heard things you shouldn't have heard.</i>

375
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.980
<i>Sorry, Young Master.</i>

376
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.160
<i>Brother, will it hurt?</i>

377
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:44.950
<i>Young Master, we'll part ways here.</i>

378
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.400
<i>Whether you live or die will be decided by the heavens.</i>

379
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.130
<i>Sorry, Master.</i>

380
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.430
Miss Jiang,

381
00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:21.950
why are you so curious about my identity?

382
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.820
If you are the person that was being chased,

383
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.080
then your existence is a big threat.

384
00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.910
Since I have found you,

385
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:34.660
then I must find out the truth.

386
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:38.430
What if I'm the same as you

387
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.730
in thinking that my identity is a threat?

388
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:46.900
You already remembered?

389
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.170
I just forgot all about it.

390
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.500
I don't care if you remembered or have forgotten.

391
00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.740
You just need to be clear on one thing.

392
00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:03.170
Your life...

393
00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:05.770
is in my hands.

394
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:46.300
<i>[Tongling County Office]</i>

395
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.980
<i>[Esteemed virtue]</i>

396
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.010
You're finally willing to see me.

397
00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.610
Tang Tianyuan,

398
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.830
since the start, I approached you

399
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.910
because of the gold.

400
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.680
That's not strange.

401
00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.570
- Because from the start, you were obsessed with— 
 - I mean...

402
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:12.630
the gold case.

403
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:14.910
That can't be.

404
00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:19.240
You came to the county office to get material to write your book.

405
00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.440
Didn't you always suspect that there was a spy in the county office who you couldn't find?

406
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.920
That's because I am the spy.

407
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.170
Zong Yinglin sent me here.

408
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.820
My motive was to remain concealed at your side in order to get first-hand information.

409
00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.380
Then use you to find the location of the hidden gold.

410
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:39.640
Then, can you explain something to me?

411
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.230
Why was Zong Yinglin constantly attempting to kill you?

412
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:46.620
Is he crazy? Does he not want his left and right hands? 
<i>(T/N: aides)</i>

413
00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:48.640
Sir Zong has his own reasons.

414
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.880
He already thought of a way to save me.

415
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.640
Turn around.

416
00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:57.660
I'm telling you to turn around and talk to me.

417
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:04.740
Your plan may look perfect,

418
00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.020
but there's a small flaw to it.

419
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:10.840
That is, why did you suddenly betray him?

420
00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.130
Because he wants to use my life to remove you from your post.

421
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.360
He's at a dead end.

422
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.360
I won't die with him.

423
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.340
Do you think I'll believe your lies?

424
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:23.860
I have never loved you.

425
00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.140
Can you stop playing around?

426
00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.830
You know that I blink when I lie.

427
00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.640
But I didn't. Did you think of this?

428
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.580
Why is it that every time you received new information,

429
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:43.000
Sir Zong was able to know and respond?

430
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.560
Why is it each time he looked to harm me, I was able to escape?

431
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:50.090
It's because this is all part of my plan

432
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:54.460
to lure you into my trap. Initially, I still felt remorse.

433
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.380
I felt I was playing with your emotions.

434
00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.490
But after hearing your words in court yesterday,

435
00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.830
there's nothing more to say since we are all being fake.

436
00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:08.310
Do you really want me to believe that you're the spy?

437
00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:12.420
Sir Tang, since I am confessing honestly,

438
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.400
please treat me leniently.

439
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.000
Okay.

440
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.300
You don't need to call for someone.

441
00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:25.990
- I know where the prison is. 
 - No need.

442
00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.120
From today onwards, you are fired from your position as an adviser.

443
00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.970
In the future... we do not owe each other.

444
00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:39.440
<i> ♫ There is a boundless distance to come ♫</i>

445
00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.100
Sir Tang, you're so merciful.

446
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.830
Be careful. It might bring trouble.

447
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.540
Go.

448
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.110
<i> ♫ Freely pick a song ♫</i>

449
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.300
<i> ♫ A good dream, a youth’s travels ♫</i>

450
00:33:55.300 --> 00:34:01.930
<i> ♫  The swaying shadows from the candle and 
longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

451
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:05.630
<i> ♫ Who is lamenting under the moon? ♫</i>

452
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:09.340
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

453
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:15.570
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

454
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:21.130
<i> ♫ Listen to the wind ♫</i>

455
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:26.960
<i> ♫ Accompanied by pear blossoms, I drink until drunk  ♫</i>

456
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.700
I finally know why a lot of people say

457
00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:34.340
"a mistress is not as good as a stolen woman." How exciting!

458
00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.630
Then go steal all you want!

459
00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.850
What's wrong? You're angry?

460
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:55.090
Then... when can make the public announcement?

461
00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.340
Have you thought about how to tell Sir Tang yet?

462
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.500
I still have some things

463
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.830
I'm not too clear about.

464
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.010
You're worried Old Tang will get back at you?

465
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.340
He won't. He's not that kind of person.

466
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.350
Sir Tang knows that these are separate matters.

467
00:35:18.350 --> 00:35:20.580
He'll understand.

468
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.140
As long as you turn over a new leaf and do good,

469
00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.000
everything is possible.

470
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.300
I believe him, but it's not because of that.

471
00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:38.110
But...

472
00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.720
I probably can't keep hiding this secret for you.

473
00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.020
Zong Yinglin won't stop.

474
00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:47.560
He keeps harming Adviser and Sir. We've given him many chances.

475
00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.740
That doesn't mean we should continue to accommodate him!

476
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.350
I know.

477
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.640
I also don't know what he's thinking.

478
00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.560
Maybe what he did yesterday was part of a gamble.

479
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.870
Or maybe...

480
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:05.890
he is still confused about which side he should be on.

481
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.790
Who cares.

482
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.410
However, if Adviser and Sir

483
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.620
are forced to part,

484
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:17.830
I will definitely not forgive him.

485
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.470
I keep thinking he's starting to suspect me.

486
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.380
That's normal! He only trusts me

487
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.480
and Adviser Tan.

488
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.310
Then, what about you?

489
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.430
Aren't you afraid that I'm falsely surrendering?

490
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:43.480
Ruyi, I believe you.

491
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.190
You were forced by another and had no choice.

492
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.170
I also believe that people will have

493
00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.430
moments when they are led astray.

494
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.340
I believe even more that as long as you come to your senses,

495
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.310
it's never too late.

496
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.620
All right, don't be unhappy!

497
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.290
I'm going to go now.

498
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.880
I will tell Sir Tang.

499
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.290
But... not today.

500
00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.850
Not today? Then, when will it be?

501
00:37:20.850 --> 00:37:24.970
Tomorrow? The day after? You need to tell me.

502
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:27.550
Soon.

503
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.600
Okay, I believe you.

504
00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.650
Don't betray my trust.


506
00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:24.180
<i> ♫ The overnight spring breeze, as I go out into the world, 
hoping not to disappoint ♫</i>

507
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.330
<i> ♫ To roam the world, just this ferry of longing, I can't let go ♫</i>

508
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.630
<i> ♫  The ferry keeps floating, but the way back seems endless ♫</i>

509
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.140
<i> ♫ The chilling waters brought a lonely boat that caught my eye ♫</i>

510
00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:43.920
<i> ♫ A fierce horse, where is it going in this mortal world? ♫</i>

511
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.270
<i> ♫ Where can I leisurely see to the limit of the cloud and stars ♫</i>

512
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:55.440
<i> ♫ On an ancient road, as the sun sets,
 I asked the young bamboo ♫</i>

513
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.410
<i> ♫ When will you reply? ♫</i>

514
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.860
<i> ♫ Only when you come here boundless ♫</i>

515
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:09.120

523
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:48.360
<i> ♫ A single flourishing blossom tree is hazier 
after being hit by the rain ♫</i>

524
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:54.490
<i> ♫ A lonely lit lamp reflects onto the paper window endlessly ♫</i>

525
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.260
<i> ♫ Endlessly, it cannot end, this spring flower ♫</i>

526
00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:03.240
<i> ♫ Seeing the dried up vines and hearing the winters crows,
 too busy to rest ♫</i>

527
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:08.510
<i> ♫ A stream of west wind, welcomes Tusu (wine), in pursuit ♫</i>

528
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:14.240
<i> ♫ In pursuit of the four seasons, the oceans, but I hesitate ♫</i>

529
00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:19.270
<i> ♫ When the brush stops, the wind stops, sleep stops ♫</i>

530
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:23.540
<i> ♫ The long journey home ♫</i>

531
