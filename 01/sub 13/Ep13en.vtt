(Previously on Episode 12)
His confession at the school anniversary

16
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:42,540
was so romantic.

17
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,260
They will be together sooner or later, right?

18
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,620
You two can have a try.

19
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,340
I think your mind must be
in sync with Cai Yasi's.

20
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:06,900
(Episode 13: Alright, I like you too)

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,260
Just to remind you that we need to work

22
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,660
tomorrow afternoon in the library.

23
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,420
The snake...

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
It's fake.

25
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,300
Oh.

26
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,900
Why are you following me?

27
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,340
You seem to have forgotten we're colleagues.

28
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,620
What?

29
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,340
I'm going to the library too.

30
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,740
What are you doing?

31
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Because you said Cai Yasi ate it for you too.

32
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,210
So what?

33
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,620
So I was angry.

34
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:32,860
Gotcha.

35
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,820
Madam.

36
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,300
Is Zhao Fanzhou here?

37
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,140
No.

38
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,140
I'm here to get the new books.

39
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,540
Alright.

40
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,180
They are all in the cart.

41
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,940
Go ahead.

42
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,300
Zhou Xiao, what are you doing?

43
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,780
Hi, Ms. Huang.

44
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,460
Why are you hiding under the table?

45
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:46,420
I...

46
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,100
I thought there was a book,

47
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,020
so I wanted to pick it up.

48
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,860
Then I'm leaving.

49
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,900
Okay.

50
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,660
You... Excuse me!

51
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,260
Excuse me!

52
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,860
What's wrong with Zhou Xiao?

53
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,420
She's so weird today.

54
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,740
Who knows?

55
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
She just hid under the table.

56
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,220
Ms. Huang,

57
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,220
I'll go help her.

58
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,740
Okay.

59
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,620
Life On Mars?

60
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,060
I thought we'd had

61
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,940
this book already.

62
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,380
Not really.

63
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,060
The book I gave to you

64
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,740
was bought by me.

65
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,820
You bought it?

66
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,500
Why?

67
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,220
Think about it.

68
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,700
Must I?

69
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,420
Yes.

70
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,300
Sorry!

71
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,100
What are you doing?

72
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,060
Sorry! Sorry! So sorry!

73
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm not here! I'm not here!

74
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,740
I'm not here! I'm not here!

75
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,420
Stop hiding.

76
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,800
Bye.

77
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,300
Let go.

78
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,220
I won't.

79
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,700
Why not?

80
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,740
I need to talk to you.

81
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,740
But, I...

82
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,020
Anybody here?

83
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,500
Ms. Huang!

84
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,340
Ms. Huang!

85
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,180
Are you looking for me?

86
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,980
Both of you.

87
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,460
The student who cleans
the broadcast studio is sick.

88
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,060
The other one has just accompanied him
to the hospital.

89
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,220
Would you please finish their work?

90
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:19,940
Ms. Huang,

91
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,020
I'm on it.

92
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,860
I don't need help.

93
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,820
I can handle it alone.

94
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,660
I will help anyway.

95
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,740
Let me help you.

96
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,420
No need.

97
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,380
You can mop the floor.

98
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,620
I can manage this.

99
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,380
Let me clean it.

100
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,940
Then I'll go mop the floor.

101
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,220
Open the door.

102
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,060
No.

103
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,660
What do you want?

104
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,460
Can you hear me out?

105
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Open the door first.

106
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,100
I won't.

107
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,940
Open it first.

108
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,460
I like you!

109
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:56,980
Wait!

110
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,060
Don't open yet!

111
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,180
Give me a sec.

112
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,940
Now, open it.

113
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,380
I need more time.

114
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,020
Let me go inside.

115
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:00,980
No.

116
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,580
Let me go in first.

117
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,380
No.

118
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,540
How about just a little while?

119
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,900
No.

120
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
Alright!

121
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,340
I...

122
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,980
I like you too!

123
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,660
Why is he approaching me?

124
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,820
Don't come closer!

125
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,860
You'll be sorry if you come any closer!

126
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,180
What are you doing?

127
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,300
So, what's the relationship between us now?

128
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,660
Are we dating?

129
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,140
How come he looks so calm?

130
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:53,660
What?

131
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,060
Zhou Xiao.

132
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,300
Zhou Xiao.

133
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:21,460
Huh?

134
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,580
Your book.

135
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,700
Sorry!

136
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:00,980
It's okay.

137
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,860
It's supposed to happen

138
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,660
between a couple.

139
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,940
Is the president here yet?

140
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,220
I think he's in the equipment room.

141
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,660
My move just now was so amazing,

142
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,380
wasn't it? Golden right hand!

143
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,620
Impressive, huh?

144
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,740
Where

145
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,140
is she going?

146
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,540
I know.

147
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,860
Let's talk another time.

148
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,220
I'm busy right now.

149
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,460
Chen Yu.

150
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,660
Lu.

151
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,980
It's good you are here.

152
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,740
I was just about to ask you
to get the racket.

153
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,660
Really?

154
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,140
Um-hum.

155
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,220
I've restrung it.

156
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,140
Give it a try.

157
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,180
Thanks.

158
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,340
How much do I owe you?

159
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,220
Never mind. It's not expensive.

160
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,460
Then...

161
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,740
Let me buy you dinner to thank you.

162
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,020
Okay.

163
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,100
But it'll be my treat.

164
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,300
Let's ask the others to join us.

165
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,820
Can it just be you and me?

166
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,500
Sure.

167
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,940
It'll be my pleasure.

168
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,260
Come here.

169
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,740
Excuse us.

170
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,180
Come on.

171
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,340
Tao Ling and the others
are waiting for me to eat.

172
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,300
They are waiting for you?

173
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,020
Yes.

174
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,460
We eat together every day.

175
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,380
Don't you?

176
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:13,700
No.

177
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,900
Seems like you and your roommates
don't get along!

178
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:17,980
What about me?

179
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,220
You?

180
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,860
What do you mean?

181
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,100
May I have the honor
to eat with my girlfriend?

182
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,500
Then let me tell them.

183
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,020
Don't move.

184
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,300
Your cuff is unbuttoned.

185
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,260
Let me help you.

186
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,660
Done! Let's go.

187
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,860
What do you want to eat?

188
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,020
Whatever. You decide.

189
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,020
Let me think.

190
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,820
Fish noodles...

191
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,780
Spicy hotpot...

192
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,900
Do you like fish noodles?

193
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,140
Sounds good.

194
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,860
OK.

195
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:51,860
Hotpot! Hotpot! Let's have hotpot!

196
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,740
Hotpot!

197
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,220
Okay!

198
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:54,660
Let's have hotpot!

199
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,060
Ten,

200
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:57,900
nine,

201
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,820
eight,

202
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,620
seven,

203
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,340
six,

204
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:00,940
five,

205
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:01,380
four,

206
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,060
three, two, one!

207
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,460
Ready!

208
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
It's perfect!

209
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,540
You really don't wanna have a try?

210
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,900
It's so yummy!

211
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,980
Try it.

212
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,980
It may look ugly,

213
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,300
but

214
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,780
it's kinda cute after you get used to it.

215
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,980
It tastes as tender as tofu.

216
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,660
You can take it

217
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,980
as meat-flavored tofu.

218
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,980
Your medical experiments have scarred you.

219
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,020
I can't share my joy with you.

220
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,820
You eat the pig brain only?

221
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,580
Have you heard of a theory?

222
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,820
When someone craves

223
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,980
for a certain food,

224
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,820
it's a sign

225
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,100
that his or her body

226
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,860
is lacking in it.

227
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,700
When that happens,

228
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,300
you need to satisfy that craving.

229
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:23,980
Tell me,

230
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,780
can my brain be treated with pig brain?

231
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,100
Now I

232
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,820
particularly want to eat
roasted pig brain.

233
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,140
Eat whatever you want.

234
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,500
Eat as much as you want.

235
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,420
Where did you learn that?

236
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,420
I just made it up.

237
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,340
I think our team

238
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,580
should focus on

239
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,700
the contest arithmetic template now,

240
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,340
such as factorial of large numbers.

241
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,460
You see,

242
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,860
from winter holiday till now,

243
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,900
we've been making mistakes.

244
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,140
I agree!

245
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,420
I often forget Init function

246
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,020
during calculation.

247
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,220
Right!

248
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,860
That is tough.

249
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,180
I spent the whole winter holiday

250
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,660
to correct this mistake.

251
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,060
Would you like

252
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,100
to practice it again

253
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,580
after dinner?

254
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,540
Sure!

255
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,540
Team leader.

256
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,820
Again?

257
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,540
My girlfriend

258
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,540
is waiting for me.

259
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,700
If you are okay with the mistake, then go!

260
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,860
Try something else.

261
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:38,940
Okay.

262
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,660
Wait...

263
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,220
Hot! Hot! Hot!

264
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:45,380
Spit it out!

265
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:10,900
It's clean now.

266
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,380
Oh!

267
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
I was doing just fine. Why did you feed me?

268
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,340
I didn't feed you the pig brain, did I?

269
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,980
I heard that.

270
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,060
Ah.

271
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:37,900
What?

272
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,940
Feed me the pig brain.

273
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,620
Really?

274
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,060
Have a try.

275
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,340
Chew it.

276
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,700
What do you think? Tasty?

277
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,700
One more bite?

278
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,580
One more bite!

279
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,020
It's super delicious!

280
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,820
Come on!

281
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:20,940
Good boy!

282
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,620
Team leader,

283
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,140
what time will we leave
for the provincial trial

284
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,780
of Asian preliminary next week?

285
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,780
My mom wants to see me off.

286
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,500
Team leader!

287
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,300
What are you looking at?

288
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:39,700
Nothing.

289
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:40,740
What's up?

290
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,940
What time will we leave
for the provincial trial

291
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,620
of Asian preliminary next week?

292
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,700
2:00 p.m. on Friday.

293
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:52,700
Oh.

294
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,060
Alright.

295
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,300
You guys, enjoy. I'll go back first.

296
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
You haven't eaten yet!

297
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,260
Where are you going?

298
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,020
I'll go play games.

299
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,940
Relax a bit before the contest.

300
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,180
Eat some more.

301
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,620
What's going on?

302
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,500
Don't know.

303
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,300
Anything wrong?

304
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,180
What's the matter?

305
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,940
Just eat.

306
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,060
So full!

307
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,380
Nice meal!

308
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,620
Really full!

309
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,380
What's wrong?

310
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,020
I can't get any bubbles.

311
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,900
It popped open again.

312
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,060
Hold it.

313
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,740
This button hole is a little big.

314
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,780
Done!

315
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,900
What... What are you doing?

316
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,900
Holding your hand.

317
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,140
Oh.

318
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,780
Cai Yasi!

319
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,940
What the heck are you doing?

320
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,660
Why aren't you moving?

321
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,140
Do you wanna die?

322
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,020
Why aren't you moving?

323
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,660
What are you doing?

324
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,260
Where are you going?

325
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,340
Where are you going?

326
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,100
Where will you go?

327
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,860
Why is he leaving?

328
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,340
How did you like the movie tonight?

329
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,220
I liked it very much.

330
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,180
The lead characters were so sweet.

331
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,380
Do you think we'll be like them?

332
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,180
Silly girl. Of course, we will.

333
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,140
We'll be together forever!

334
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,740
Really?

335
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,340
Yes.

336
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,060
What?

337
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,220
I need to answer my phone.

338
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,940
Use the other hand.

339
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,740
(Cai Yasi)

340
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:40,820
Hello?

341
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:41,750
Zhou Xiao.

342
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,410
What?

343
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,100
Now you are willing to show up?

344
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,740
I just saw you.

345
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,660
Where did you see me?

346
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,580
In the dining room.

347
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,700
I saw you were with Zhao Fanzhou.

348
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:57,420
Oh.

349
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,460
Are you...

350
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,260
dating each other?

351
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,300
Yes.

352
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,100
We are.

353
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,500
Cai Yasi.

354
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,020
Cai Yasi?

355
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,660
Good for you, buddy!

356
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,020
You are finally recycled

357
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,300
by an environmentalist.

358
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
What does that mean?
Are you mocking me?

359
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,660
No, I'm not.

360
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,460
I just want to tell you

361
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,540
I'll go for a training
at the end of this month.

362
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,860
Don't miss me too much.

363
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,260
Save it.

364
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,060
I have a boyfriend.
Why would I miss you?

365
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,380
Makes sense.

366
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,940
Let me know

367
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,220
if he treats you bad.

368
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,820
So what can you do if I tell you?

369
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,620
You'll stop his entire family

370
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,660
from getting online?

371
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:46,340
Alright,

372
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:46,900
I have to go now.

373
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,140
Okay.

374
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:48,740
Bye.

375
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,260
I'll go back to my dorm now.

376
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,230
Okay.

377
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,820
I'm going.

378
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,260
Okay.

379
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,540
See you tomorrow.

380
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,340
Okay, see you tomorrow.

Why does Zhou Xiao get him?

387
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,980
You... You've taken away my love!

388
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:11,580
Me?

389
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,420
Why?

390
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,380
Zhou Xiao,

391
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,260
I can't believe you are this type of person!

392
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,740
You've taken away the love of my dream!

393
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,740
I've finally seen through you!

394
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,580
Tell you what?

395
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,500
From now on,

396
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
we won't be friends anymore!

397
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:26,460
Wait!

398
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,140
You have Fang Wei,

399
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,140
and you...

400
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,540
you never told me

401
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,660
you liked Zhao Fanzhou.

402
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,060
What am I supposed to do

403
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,980
since I'm already with him.

404
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,980
What?

405
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:36,900
What?

406
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,580
I was talking about Ren Yiyang!

407
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,100
Who?

408
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,300
That is not the point.

409
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,860
The point is...

410
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,620
Let me...

411
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,020
Zhao Xiao,

412
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,180
you are dating Zhao Fanzhou?

413
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,460
I...

414
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:53,780
Spill it!

415
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,620
I'll tell everything.

416
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:56,740
Tell us!

417
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,500
Come on!

418
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,860
Today,

419
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,020
I accepted his love request.

420
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,060
(Mihoo)

421
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:12,780
You

422
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,780
just accepted him like that?

423
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:17,740
Then,

424
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,340
did you...

425
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,740
Hold on.

426
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,100
Lu,

427
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,260
how come

428
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,380
you are even more gossipy than me today?

429
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
I just want to learn

430
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,460
something from Zhou Xiao.

431
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,980
Come here!

432
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,540
Come here!

433
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,660
It has nothing to do...

434
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,180
Something's up!

435
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,340
There's something going on with you, too!

436
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,420
Tell us.

437
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,700
That Chen Yu

438
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,540
fixed my racket.

439
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,500
I'll take him out for a meal tomorrow,

440
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,500
and that's when

441
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,580
I'll tell him I like him.

442
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,380
No wonder

443
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,820
you are known as a goddess.

444
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:52,060
You can always calmly tackle emergency.

445
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,900
But you want to learn from me?

446
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,100
I think

447
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,500
your beauty is all you need.

448
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,860
Would you like to use my Mihoo facial masks?

449
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,540
It keeps your face hydrated and pretty.

450
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:05,660
It's made for girls like you

451
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,780
who will go out on a date tomorrow.

452
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,380
Feel free to take it!

453
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,460
Don't you think it's like

454
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,340
spring festival here in our room today?

455
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,460
One started dating,
and another is going to.

456
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,580
Wei,

457
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,780
when will be your turn?

458
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:19,860
What?

459
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,260
I...

460
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
I'll go prepare the teaching material
for my foreign student now.

461
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,820
I'll go figure out what I'll wear tomorrow.

462
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,620
I'm going!

463
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,500
Apply the mask!

464
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,420
Foreign student!

465
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,020
Tao Ling,

466
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,100
the foreign student you just mentioned,

467
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,100
the guy who's so handsome

468
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,060
that you'd give up on our friendship.

469
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,060
What does he look like?

470
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,460
Come here. Let me show you.

471
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:48,980
So this is him?

472
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,060
He really is good-looking.

473
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,740
Ren Yiyang.

474
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,660
Korean.

475
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,860
Single.

476
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:55,860
23 years old.

477
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,260
He likes durian

478
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,340
and cartoons.

479
00:35:59,180 --> 00:35:59,460
Wait.

480
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
How come you know so much about him?

481
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,940
He's the most handsome one
among all the foreign students.

482
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,380
I've noticed him

483
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,980
since last year when our college asked us

484
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,420
to tutor the foreign students Chinese

485
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,420
one-on-one.

486
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,540
I spent the whole winter holiday praying.

487
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,540
But I didn't expect

488
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,460
that you got the chance to tutor him.

489
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,020
Sorry about that!

490
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,820
Show me the one you'll tutor.

491
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,180
She's cute!

492
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,740
This is Luo Wei's student.

493
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,420
Then... Then yours...

494
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,460
This is mine!

495
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,020
Don't laugh!

496
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,300
Well.

497
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,140
Cheer up!

498
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,060
You can do it!

499
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,380
I have faith in you!

500
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,140
Night!

501
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,980
I'm going to bed.

502
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,180
Zhou Xiao!

503
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,740
Let's have a short meeting.

504
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:00,060
You guys did a good job on dehumidification.

505
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,660
The library will be officially open

506
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,140
to the public today.

507
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,260
In addition

508
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,180
to your previous responsibilities,

509
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,860
Ms. Liu will give you

510
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,060
some new assignments.

511
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:19,780
Zhou Xiao,

512
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,220
you'll be in charge

513
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,860
of changing the bar codes

514
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,980
and the storage of book information.

515
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:25,740
Situ Hao, you'll be in charge

516
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,980
of making new book catalogue

517
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,820
and recommending them to our readers.

518
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,620
Okay, madam.

519
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,580
Wu Feifei,

520
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,260
please register those lost books.

521
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,500
Zhao Fanzhou,

522
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,340
you'll be in charge
of the borrowing situation

523
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,220
of our precious literature.

524
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,700
Okay.

525
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,700
Zhou Xiao!

526
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,020
What are you doing here?

527
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,260
To help you.

528
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,420
But,

529
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,860
the Room of Precious Literature...

530
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,740
I've finished my work.

531
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,500
That quickly?

532
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
Let's begin.

533
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:03,820
Tell me what to do.

534
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,500
Okay.

535
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,460
We have a book list here.

536
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,020
Check the corresponding
bar code to each book.

537
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:09,340
Okay.

538
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,140
Look.

539
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,620
Then attach the bar code

540
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:12,740
on

541
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,340
the title page.

542
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:16,500
And use

543
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,500
this scanner

544
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,700
to scan the code.

545
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,860
The book will appear on the catalogue.

546
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,420
Then save it.

547
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,140

Not at all!
