WEBVTT

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.980
Love Is All

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.980
Episode 03
Tan Lingyin nailed the position of adviser
Zhou Zhengdao got into the Office as a spy

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.080
Where are you going?

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.400
Arrest him.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.910
Help! Help!

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.390
I'm exhausted.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.470
What do we do next?

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.800
Just...

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.830
wait for it.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.960
Let's get back first.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.080
Let's go.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.000
Don't move.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.160
Help!

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.800
Release Adviser.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.470
Officer Zheng.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.520
Let's go. Let's go.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.750
Go, go. Hurry.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.190
W-What happened to your face?

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.110
My face?

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360
What are you guys doing?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.390
Adviser Tan.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.000
If you want to be the head girl of Tian Xiang Club,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.390
you can resign to Magistrate Tang.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.880
It's a mistake. A mistake.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.550
I'm leaving. See you in the County Office.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.110
Let's go.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.520
Stop!

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.550
In the future,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.270
I'll be careful with my words and deeds,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.360
and won't make a mistake.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.110
If I make a mistake, one demerit point penalty.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.910
If I make a mistake again, one serious demerit point penalty.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.630
If I make it again and again,

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.190
one super serious demerit point penalty.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.750
It's so insincere.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.030
How is that possible, Magistrate?

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.670
I wrote every character with my heart and soul.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.910
My guilt is shown in each character.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.880
I have work to do.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.320
I'll come back and repent to you later.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:53.080
Come back.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.470
If you make a mistake,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.520
one demerit point penalty,

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.390
50-tael deduction in your pay.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.550
Three penalty points, you'll be fired.

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.960
No way.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.880
If you fire me,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.960
who's gonna protect you?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.960
You want to protect me with such a low IQ?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.390
You just care about yourself, you don't care about me.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.600
I was sold to Tian Xiang Club.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.110
You're a lady.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.480
How can you sit on the ground?

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.390
I just want to get a job.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.880
Can you stop crying?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.200
No.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.760
Unless...

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.000
Unless what?

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.000
Unless you promise to never drive me out.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.790
In your dreams.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.830
Why am I so miserable?

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.390
Adviser, please respect yourself.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.760
Magistrate.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.200
Officer Zheng brought someone.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.720
I'm so miserable.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.200
My god.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.320
Go and wash my clothes.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.760
You keep crying.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.550
Don't stop without my permission.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.720
I'm so miserable.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.350
Let's go.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.790
Yes.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.670
I'm not that obedient.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.200
Why does he look so familiar?

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:33.200
Who recommended him?

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:35.200
If I'm recommended by someone,

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.390
how will I come to this remote... town?

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.720
There are more people than official positions.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.110
I'm an honest man.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.920
I don't want to waste money on buying a position.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.270
I've waited for so many years

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.390
without a right one for me.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.000
I heard no one wants to come to Tongling.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.670
So I got this chance.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.480
It's true.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.720
You'll be a colleague of us.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.950
There are many empty rooms.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Find one with good sunlight,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.550
and settle there.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.640
It's not urgent.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.040
May I know where the name list of county officials

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.830
and the unsolved case files are stored?

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:10.440
I can go and have some paperwork prepared.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.640
Personnel?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.830
A-All here.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.480
Just three?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.760
The adviser went out.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.350
If everything goes as planned,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.390
all here.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.480
Officer Zheng. Why are you following me?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.270
It's hard to see a face that is comparable to

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.720
Magistrate Tang in this County Office.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.880
It won't do you any harm just for some simple glances.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.790
Besides, you got a manly figure and a girly face.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.270
You must be a blessed one in the future.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.070
Brother Zhou, what's wrong with you?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.320
Why is your face so red all of a sudden?

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.830
I must warn you.

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.230
Tongling has a lot of game,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.390
but also a lot of poison.

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.510
You need to be careful with that.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.550
Thank you, Officer Zheng. I'm a vegetarian.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.670
Tongling is a dangerous place.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.080
Officer Zheng is refering to the death of Sang Jie?

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.960
More than that.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:33.909
Tongling

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.999
is also a hot spot covered with gold.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.200
It's all rumors. It can't be trusted.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.470
So, you don't want gold?

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:43.200
Illegal gains are not desirable.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.760
If I happen to get it,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.960
I'll confiscate that.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.400
You, do your job well.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.910
On your knees.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.320
Isn't this my Tian Xiang Club co-partner.,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.880
Magistrate Tang?

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.960
Where's the head girl of Tian Xiang Club?

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.590
Zhang Zhiyuan.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.110
You collude with officials. Force girls into prostitutes.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:11.280
Bully people everywhere.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.590
Do you admit to the charges?

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:17.440
I act cautiously and obediently.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.790
Your Honor. Why do you use such charges

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.790
to slander me?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:25.790
Do you disagree with the 3:7 ratio?

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:27.880
Bring Yun'er up here.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:35.030
Wait... You're...

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.470
You're Yun'er?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.550
Then... that's right.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.000
That...

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.200
Yun'er, Have no fear. Magistrate Tang will help you.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.440
Tell us everything.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.640
Your Honor, we've paid the money back.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.000
But he didn't admit it.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.350
and forced me to pay the debt in Tian Xiang Club.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.080
All neighbors know about it.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.910
You've paid?

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.230
A receipt without the seal of Tian Xiang Club

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.200
You said you've paid it back?

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.910
I'm telling you. Don't use your poverty

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.000
as a reason to say those shitty words.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:05.880
Your Honor.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.520
That receipt was surely sealed.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.790
But...

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.760
But what?

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.110
Now you have no human nor physical evidence.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.000
Your Honor, you can't slander me.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.320
Nothing's changed.

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.960
I'm sorry. This brother,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.000
we haven't met, have we?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.670
I heard County Office has a female adviser.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.520
I thought she must be brilliant.

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.200
I didn't expect her to be

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.200
a rude and careless girl.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.840
Who did you say is rude?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.710
We just met for the first time.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.840
How can you denigrate people like that?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.350
Who exactly are you?

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.110
I'm Zhou Zhengdao, Tongling County Magistrate's assistant.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.640
She must be sent by Tang Feilong.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.640
It's gone. I got it.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.590
Magistrate, why didn't start the trial without me?

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.790
I'm telling you, I have proof

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.400
for his con and and illegal usury.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.880
The account book is here.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.520
Where did you get that?

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.960
You're pretty good at hiding things.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.880
You wrapped account book in waterproof wrap.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.110
and dropped it into a well in the backyard.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.440
A well, if not used as a source of water,

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.790
must have something wrong. Am I right?

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:33.550
That's right.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.350
Besides,

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.640
your eyes and behavior gave you out.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.200
The novel reads like this

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.520
if one cares about something,

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:43.790
in time of emergency,

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.760
he'll go to that thing he thinks is most valuable.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.840
After Magistrate Tang turned you down,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.590
you went straight to the backyard.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:50.110
Am I right?

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.080
Adviser Tan, we're here to try.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.320
Why are you talking about novels?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.400
I... I... I...

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:01.910
An old habit.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.230
Now human and physical evidence are all here.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.000
It's time to confess.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:12.400
Your Honor, you're a member of Tian Xiang Club.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.030
What will happen to you, if I'm guilty?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.910
What do you mean? You committed a crime,

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.150
and you want to drag Magistrate Tang into it?

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.910
As a county magistrate, you should be honest.

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.320
See this carefully.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.000
There's your seal on it.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.910
A proof with sealed contract.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.520
Your Honor, you can't deny this.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.840
Seal?

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.230
Where's the seal?

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.110
Do you see that/

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.030
No?

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.550
It really doesn't have a seal.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.400
But... But what I gave you is clearly...

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.350
Manager Zhang tampered with this sealing wax.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.590
This sealing wax is made of special red powder,

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.550
potions and distillers grains.

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:00.520
Under the wind and sunlight,

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.960
it will disappear without a trace.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.880
That's how you con the public for money.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.710
Then why is this one...

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.590
That day,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.760
when I went to his room to search for clues,

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.230
I found these two boxes of sealing wax.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.400
I was in a hurry, so I misplaced them.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.790
Adviser Tan, good job.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:25.670
You cunning cheater.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.840
Now you've shot yourself in the foot.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.960
You've conned the whole citizens

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.760
of Tongling County for a total of 1,500 taels.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:34.880
You Honor.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.110
All of them have receipts with the disappeared seals.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.000
The evidence is now solid. Punish him.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:46.550
Someone put him in jail.

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.710
Take him down.

00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:49.230
Yes.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:55.000
Court is adjourned.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.470
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.080
I've done a great job.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:13.000
Looks like you really knew you were wrong this time.

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.640
Do you think this time

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.400
I've make up for the mistake?

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:27.520
But are you still going to be an adviser?

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.000
That's something I've decided upon.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.080
How could I give it up so easily?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.150
Besides, in this world

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.550
women are not as good as men.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.640
But it's okay.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.080
I believe that as long as I work hard enough,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.470
I can be as good as a man.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.550
A big head.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.030
What big head?

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.880
It's all up to me to turn him down this time.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:53.880
If you hadn't messed with it,

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.440
there's no need for the trial.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.320
I got rid of an evil.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.550
I've made up for the mistake, right?

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.110
Without me,

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.760
you're an accomplice of that thief now.

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.230
Don't you have the tiniest bit of

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.960
gratitude to me?

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.230
Not at all?

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.280
You're impulsive and don't think about the consequences.

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.670
Overly ambitious and act only for quick success and profit.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.550
With your attitude,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.400
how do you work in the County Office?

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:21.710
If I hadn't found the account book in the well,

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:22.550
what are you gonna do now?

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.230
Have you ever thought about

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.910
why there was no water in the well that day?

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.760
That's because they can't soak the account book.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:30.960
That's because the day before,

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.200
I asked Officer Zheng to cut through the shaft wall.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.320
and drained the well.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.350
Do you think

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.910
you're the smartest one here,

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.000
and we're all idiots?

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.200
Then... the secret of the sealing wax

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.080
is found out by me.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:46.640
Just pure luck.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.590
Can it be used as something to ask for a reward?

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.880
Alright.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:54.670
Then I'll pack my stuff and leave.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:58.910
I'm leaving.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.470
You...

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.000
It's alright.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.400
If you don't want me here, others will do.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.470
No one's gonna stop me.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.000
I, Tan Lingyin,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.840
have done so many good deeds,

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.440
but no one remembers me.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.590
I'm really leaving.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.400
I have to leave here today.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:26.710
I have to get out of here today.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.670
I'm leaving. I'm really leaving.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:37.550
Fine.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:40.470
Just this once.

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.880
If there's another mistake, you're fired right away.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.640
Really?

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:47.150
I don't need to go.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:48.590
Hurry up and thank Flygon.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.760
Zheng Shaofeng!

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.030
You control the situation.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.670
I won't get into that.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.200
I'm leaving.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.520
How can you leave? Xiaoliu! Dawang!

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.320
You're the best magistrate in the world.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:05.680
Why is it sealed?

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.520
I have no idea.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:08.189
Did he offend someone?

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.000
No.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.040
Officer.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.069
I... What?

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.069
Stop, stop.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.949
What should we do, sir?

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.880
I'm already married.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:18.230
I'm not married.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.920
Officer.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.040
Officer. Officer.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.639
Did Magistrate Tang find out everything about Zhang?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.829
What? Anything else to report?

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.280
No, I'm just asking.

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.710
Zhang Zhiyuan is the mastermind,

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.310
and you guys are forced to live here and persecuted by him.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.520
So Magistrate decided to let you go.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.190
But you have to behave.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.470
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:51.190
Let's leave here.

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.280
We need to book a private room at Zui Xian Club

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.000
Let's go.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.680
Officer.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.070
Let's go.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.350
Don't go.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.760
Goodbye.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:56.160
Don't go.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:56.920
Remember me.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.640
Let's go.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.640
What should we do in the future?

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.520
What do you want to see me for?

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:03.800
You have an adviser.

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.190
Can't you just give me a few days off?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.400
Look at this.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040
What kind of means is this?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.070
The handwriting can be erased?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.190
You're stupid enough.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.190
Even if it can be erased,

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.230
it'll leave a mark.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.160
This is clearly an empty account book.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.310
Try to recall your memory.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:29.760
When you sneaked into Tian Xiang Club,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.000
were you caught by anyone?

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.560
You mean,

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.680
someone changed the account book?

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:36.350
Is that Zhang Zhiyuan?

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.430
I don't think it's Zhang Zhiyuan.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:39.000
If it's him,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.590
he'll ask for a look on the spot.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.070
But that's enough to prove

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.710
Adviser Tan is innocent.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:46.190
Otherwise,

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.590
how could she use a fake one to confront him?

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.640
You suspect she's in collusion with Zhang Zhiyuan?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.280
Now this clearly proves that she is good.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:56.110
I don't think so. There are only two possibilities.

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.280
One, Adviser Tan is extremely smart.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.160
And she set up a trap

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.310
to lure us in.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.680
Use the account book

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.160
to gain our trust.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.760
Or

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.680
she's a real idiot.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.520
From my point of view,

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.110
your bark is worse than your bite.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.190
If you don't care about Adviser Tan,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:16.160
why did you make me work so hard yesterday

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:17.110
and went down the well to help her?

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.430
You still want her to stay.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:21.280
Oh, right.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.000
Did Assistant Zhou take office today?

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.040
Yeah, she came early in the morning.

00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:28.710
You and I just arrived at Tongling.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.310
There are two new comers around us.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.040
Find out their background.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.110
Your want to look into everything.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.760
I should look into you first.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.520
In this County Office,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.110
the only one with a secret is you.

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.040
Between people,

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.110
can't there be more trust?

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:47.110
Okay.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.350
I'll go check them.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.190
And

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.280
Xiaoliu has booked a private room

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.070
for me in Zui Xian Club.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:56.830
What?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.160
You're going to set up a Hongmen banquet?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.400
Drink.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.710
Come on.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.160
Cheers.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.350
Adviser did a good job this time.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.310
It's just this account book.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.590
has a lot of mysteries.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.190
It was quite interesting.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.310
What mysteries does it have?

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.640
I was in a hurry yesterday.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:32.880
I didn't even have time to look at it.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.110
I've done another great job, right?

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.280
With Sang Jie's help, Zhang Zhiyuan

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.640
made a lot of dirty money from Tian Xiang Club.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.110
It's all recorded in this account book.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.280
But there's a huge amount of income,

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.350
I can't figure it out.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.760
And this income is not in silver.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.800
But...

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.560
Gold?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.000
Adviser knows it well.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.110
Can you explain it to me?

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.310
In our Tongling county,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:04.830
why is there such a big gold income?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.680
It's not difficult at all.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.280
When Sang Jie illegally mined the gold,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.680
Zhang Zhiyuan must have got a share.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.400
Then what should we do?

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.430
I've waited for so many years

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:15.160
to get this job as a magistrate assistant.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.040
Why do I have such a big case

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.470
right after I taking office?

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.520
Magistrate, what am I supposed to do?

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.070
Why do you care about your career now?

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.560
Our top priority is

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.830
to find the gold.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.000
Finally, there's a clue.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.430
Why is this blank?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.950
Didn't you say this has something to do with Sang Jie?

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.590
Yeah, or else how could I know that

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.400
you have such an interest in the gold case?

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.070
Am I right? Assistant Zhou.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.400
I just took office yesterday.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.560
About Tian Xiang Club,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.110
I-I have no idea.

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.400
You have no idea?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.350
The County Office

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:05.950
only has two new comers.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:07.350
Did this account book

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.760
fly away all by itself?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.590
What do you mean?

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.470
You mean I changed this book?

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.160
Can you think with your brain?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.280
If I knew it was blank,

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.920
do I dare to confront Zhang Zhiyuan with it?

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.400
Maybe you thought about it in advance,

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.470
and play it out in front of us.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:23.710
Are you crazy?

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.070
If I were so smart,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.760
would you get the chance to be a county magistrate?

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.520
Impudence!

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.640
I'm being honest.

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.190
Okay, then let's wait and see.

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:33.680
It's less then four hours since Zhang Zhiyuan

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.640
received the sentence.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.520
And you two

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.430
never have got out of my sight.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.640
It's not clear now that

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.040
which of you changed it.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.190
But tonight, even if Zheng Shaofeng

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.800
has to dig the ground for three feet tonight,

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.830
I'll have him find the real account book for me.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:48.520
Get in here.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.640
Magistrate, please spare my life.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.310
I'm wronged.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.280
The madam of Tian Xiang Club

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.520
was eavesdropping by the door.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:01.230
What do you want?

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.830
I'm just afraid that

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.430
Zhang Zhiyuan would turn me in.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.230
So I came over and have a look.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.800
See what Magistrate Tang has found out.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.470
What exactly was between you and Zhang Zhiyuan?

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.640
In addition to running Tian Xiang Club, he's also

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640
a human trafficker.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.430
I just helped him find the girls.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.350
I didn't do anything else.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.000
The large sum was taken by him.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:23.350
It was recorded clearly on the book.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.190
Where's the book?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.640
Magistrate Tang, I have the account book.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.430
I was stupid.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:33.920
I accidentally saw Officer Zhengd drilling the well that day

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.710
I'm afraid that it might be found out.

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:36.880
and drag me into it.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.920
So I hid account book.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.310
Now I see it.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.230
Magistrate Tang,

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.680
you're really smart.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.800
Zheng Shaofeng, take her down.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.950
Go get the real account book.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:51.710
Yes.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.040
Go.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.680
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:13.000
You two,

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.280
take her back first.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.160
I'll stay here.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:16.920
Okay, don't worry.

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.680
Yes.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.110
Go.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.350
Now you know where account book is.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.830
Why don't you tell Zheng Shaofeng to pick it up,

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.280
but ask me to do it?

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.950
What do you think?

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.590
Do you like me?

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:34.280
And you want to help me solve the case,

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.350
and to get rewarded for my good deeds?

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.350
Why are you always overly confident?

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:42.680
Why are you helping me?

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.350
If you were a mole in the County Office,

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.800
how would you deal with these books?

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.560
I will hide them or destroy the evidence.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.160
You're still testing me?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:59.640
If that madam hadn't told the truth,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.070
would you frame me for that?

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.560
That's because what you did

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.920
were so suspicious.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.430
I just want to find Sang Jie's gold soon,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.950
to get promoted and awarded a title.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.640
Forget it.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:12.520
You don't have such potential.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.350
Don't you look down upon me.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.400
I'm sure I can take one step at a time,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.950
and impress others.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.040
I want to go back to the capital.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.000
Why do you want to go there?

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:23.830
For Tang Tianyuan?

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:25.680
Do you know him?

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.710
I can't reach him.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.070
That's for sure.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.950
He's completely different from you.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.280
He's super smart.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.760
He surely won't wrong me for this.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.040
It's just that if all the girls

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.310
do what you did to him,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.680
he's kind of miserable.

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.110
What's wrong with me?

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.920
I'm fearless and valiant.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.920
Intelligent and quick-witted.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.800
You're...

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:47.070
shameless.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:49.920
I don't care.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.310
How's it going?

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.640
I've searched Tang's

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.400
and Cheng's rooms.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.190
I found nothing.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.160
What about the madam?

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:10.640
Speaking of which, it pissed me off.

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.710
The madam sent her daughter to seduce me.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.070
Fortunately, I'm determined.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:19.800
I almost fell.

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.110
Almost?

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.760
Almost.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.350
Here you go. I've checked.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.760
The madam did steal it.

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.040
She also said she worked for Zhang Zhiyuan.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.680
This book clearly said

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.160
he's done a lot of human trafficking.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.830
This Zhang Zhiyuan

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:42.000
was in collusion with Sang Jie,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.110
But in the gold case,

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.350
the account is clear without omission.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.760
I think Zhang Zhiyuan should be innocent.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.640
Now you must believe

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.230
your adviser and assistant

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.590
are innocent, right?

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.800
Don't doubt people all the time.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.430
We're all family.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.470
Domestic thieves are the hardest to defend.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.680
Although this time, we found everything out.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.000
But in the future, we still need to

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.110
be extra careful.

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.830
You can leave.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.040
Account book's checked.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.710
It's not related to Sang Jie's illegal gold mining.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.760
No trace's left, please be assured.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.760
What are you doing in my room?

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.110
He wrote about Tang Feilong, not you.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.160
Why are you so nervous?

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:56.640
Book of Changes says

00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:58.400
flying dragon is up in the sky.

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:00.430
Isn't Tang Feilong referring to Tang Tianyuan?

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.350
A swine over fat is the cause of his own bane.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.110
Don't rip it apart.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.830
Here's the thing.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.920
Miaomiaosheng portrays Tang Feilong as

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.310
an extravagant man that cares about only parties and drinks.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.760
But girls just like the stories of

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.000
such an affectionate seducer

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.950
giving all his love to one girl.

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.110
Why do you think might be the reason?

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.070
It's love. It's love.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:32.040
Sis, lately someone purchased books with gold.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.280
Really?

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:40.000
So rich.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.190
You remember the guest?

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400
She's a girl.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.950
Based on the purity of these two pieces,

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.590
they're likely to be mined.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.710
It's not refined yet.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:58.710
It's from Mount Tianmu.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.560
Isn't Mount Tianmu blocked

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:02.350
because it's haunted?

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.710
You don't know Mount Tianmu has a gold mine?

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.350
So if they want to mine gold illegally,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.920
of course they won't allow others in.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.070
The haunted thing is just an excuse.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.590
Illegal gold mining?

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:17.350
That's a felony. It'll get people beheaded.

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.070
His Majesty asked you to check this case.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.710
Why did he do that?

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.230
Just for the cause of Sang Jie's death?

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:31.070
It's not that simple.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.040
If this gold mining is real,

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.000
who's the mastermind?

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:40.640
How many people know about the gold?

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.520
Where is the gold hidden?

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.110
And the most important point,

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.800
how many corrupted officials are involved?

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.560
These are all unsolved mysteries.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:52.090
The former county magistrate blocked the mountain

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.160
with ghost stories,

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.430
and then died on the way to trial in the capital.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:58.230
I'm sure he's involved in the

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:59.400
illegal gold mining case.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.430
Magistrate won't let me see the file.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:04.830
I can sneak in there on my own.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.310
Case file. Case file.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.710
Where did Tang Feilong hide Sang Jie's case file?

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.070
What are you looking for?

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.430
Sang Jie's case file. What else can I...

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.880
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.760
I'm not Tan Lingyin.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.040
It's the middle of the night.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:07.920
What are you doing in my study?

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.800
I think the wind is so strong,

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.110
and you opened your door.

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.040
So I came to close the door.

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.350
It's also because of the strong wind

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.640
that these files were scattered onto the ground?

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:22.310
Nonsense.

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.230
If you don't tell me the truth today,

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:27.040
leave the County Office right away.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.640
- No. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. - Say it.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:32.640
I was...

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:36.800
I was...

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.680
I was doing this for you.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.640
Everyone says that Tongling has

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.070
a charming man that will make all other men's life miserable.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.520
Ever since I saw you,

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.040
I can't eat well.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.230
Nor can I sleep well.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:02.400
My mind is full of you.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.280
So I came in the middle of the night.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.520
Nonsense.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.110
Are you not confident about

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:14.760
your own appearance?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.190
I don't believe in what you said.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:36.710
Adviser, please respect yourself.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.430
Now you can believe me, right?

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.110
Can you... Can you

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.470
stay... stay away from me?

00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:55.470
You...

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.920
Got it.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.040
Excuse me.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.470
Wait, wait.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.310
I-I'm not gay.

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:12.350
Right. Right.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.190
You.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.310
I wore this makeup because I'm too pretty.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.070
It's late at night.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.920
It's not that safe for me to be so pretty.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.920
Isn't this cute?

00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:32.310
How do you explain you want to steal case files?

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:33.880
Let me tell you the truth.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.110
Sang Jie caused so much trouble in Tongling.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.400
Although I am an ordinary citizen,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.590
I'm also outraged.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.680
I know that's also why you're here, right?

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.680
I'm willing to defend justice with you.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:48.760
Tan Mulan.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.880
Of course, I'm hot-blooded.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:53.950
I know you won't make me an adviser.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.350
So I came to see what I can find from the case file,

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.920
to show you a different me.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.800
Then what can you do?

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.560
I can do a lot.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.920
I know astronomy, geography

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.230
zheng, chess, calligraphy and painting.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.390
Is that a surprise? Are you impressed?

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.430
Please help me close the door from the outside.

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:16.149
You don't want me as an adiver?

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:17.870
If you want to step down early,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.560
come and tell me anytime.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:28.149
Magistrate, you don't even know how miserable my life is.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:31.320
I came to Tongling with Qingchen.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.560
Every... Every day we eat

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.429
steamed buns with pickles.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.799
Is that because your family was in decline?

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.430
so you're forced to come to Tongling?

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.520
If I say...

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.150
I have a family I can't go back, do you believe me?

00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:54.190
I don't believe you.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.230
Then I have nothing to say.

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:06.150
You have work to do tomorrow.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.910
Go back to bed early.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.910
Oh, right.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.760
Wash your face before you go out.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.080
Don't scare anyone.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.080
Wash it in your room?

00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.390
You can go home like this.

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:07.430
Pyrus

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.020
Look at that.
Pyrus

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.190
Look at that.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.710
Why are you bringing so much stuff this time?

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.630
My lord and my ladyship said

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:18.470
my lord you come to Tongling for work this time,

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.910
and can't go back to the capital for days.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.560
They asked us to serve my lord here.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.470
Leave the books and daily necessities.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.320
Take the rest way.

00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:30.040
I can't use that much.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.280
We didn't bring anything unnecessary.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.950
It's just that my ladyship instructed

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.630
we need to bring this old jar,

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:37.360
to make soup for you, my lord.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.430
Then you two know

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.670
what my identity is this time?

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.120
Of course.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.430
You're the parental officer of Tongling County, Tang...

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.800
Feilong.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.760
Magistrate Tang Feilong.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.520
Zucchini, a little higher.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.190
A little higher.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:56.710
Coming.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.080
How can an adviser shout like this?

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:07.230
Muskmelon. Pyrus.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.840
Take this thing apart for me today.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.840
Is she the female adviser?

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:14.800
But...

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.430
it took a lot of effort to put it up.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.080
Magistrate, you just turn a blind eye on it.

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.870
She's surely a country woman.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:23.800
That's who you are.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.320
I'm asking you one last time.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:26.910
Are you coming down or not?

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.190
I am not.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.230
- Zucchini. - Okay.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.840
Come on.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:35.360
Coming.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:04.000
Let go. Let go.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.360
I'll break down the swing right away.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.000
Keep it.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:21.430
You're all bullying me.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:36.190
Sister Linying. You see that girl?

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.910
She's the one that used gold

00:38:38.910 --> 00:38:40.800
to buy half of the books in the store.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.560
She's so rich.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:43.190
Really?

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:44.280
Of course.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.360
Zhuang, why don't you get back to your work?

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:47.760
Okay.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.950
This lady.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:55.230
Your good look will overshadow everything.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.470
New books just arrive at the store.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:58.120
Wanna take a look?

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.280
I heard this time Mr. Miao

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.630
changed his usual style

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.800
and tried a suspense.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.320
Yes.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.670
Romance is not popular lately.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.710
Everyone likes something exciting.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:09.390
Then why not combine these two?

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.910
Following the trend will only attract attention for a moment.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.670
With Mr. Miao's talent,

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.150
he can create his own style.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.600
Isn't it better?

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.840
That makes sense.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.120
Miaomiaosheng is good at writing romance.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.950
If he can combine it into a detective one,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:28.760
it must be refreshing.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.950
You're absolutely right.

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.230
I'll tell Mr. Miao right away.

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:34.800
How about killing for love?

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.200
A young girl meets her loved one,

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.000
but she died in the mountain.

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.760
That sounds intriguing.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.150
I think that's shameless.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.670
Who is that?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.560
Hui, it took me so long to find you.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.120
What do you want, Mr. Sun?

00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.800
I've sent invitation letters to your house every day.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.760
But you always refuse me with the excuse of illness.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.910
Then I'll have to find you myself.

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.630
See?

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.190
This is one-sided love.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.360
Draw water with a seive.

00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:26.150
Sis, you're not going to write that in the novel, are you?

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:29.230
Of course I won't write it.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.390
But I just said something randomly,

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.760
and she thinks it's intriguing.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:36.910
It's on the right track.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.950
You're good at writing love novels,

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:41.710
but not good at homicide cases.

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.800
It'll work out.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.630
Come on.
