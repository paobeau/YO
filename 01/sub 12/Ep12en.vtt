(Previously on Episode 11)
I've heard that

16
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,220
the Geminids will come tomorrow.

17
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:43,900
I'll go there too.

18
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,540
Let's go and see
the Detective Exhibition together.

19
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,180
But I've agreed

20
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,380
to go there with Cai Yasi.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,920
Fanzhou, I'll get a good position for you.

22
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,870
I have to go to the playground to see
the meteor shower with my roommates.

23
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,780
Let's go together.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,300
(Episode 12: Warm Humid Days
are Also Love Days)

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,150
You were driven away because you always won,

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,420
but I always lost,
why didn't they let me stay?

27
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,740
Because you're stupid.

28
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,630
Chen Yu.

29
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,580
What are you doing?

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,780
You keep playing with your phone.

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,380
Nothing.

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,430
I'm going down.

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,240
Okay.

34
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,260
Lu,

35
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
are you okay?

36
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,420
Lu,

37
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,540
I heard you coughing.

38
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,460
The seal is not broken.

39
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,140
I'll open it for you.

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,500
Drink more water.

41
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,240
Thank you.

42
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,700
Don't be like this.

43
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Lu will be awkward.

44
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,980
Are you being shy?

45
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,300
A pair of twos.

46
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,280
Let's play a game together.

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,660
Psychologist Arthur Aron carried out a study

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,420
called "The Experimental Generation
of Interpersonal Closeness."

49
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,380
Strangers pair up

50
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,380
and answer all 36 questions.

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,300
Then they stare into each other's eyes
for four minutes.

52
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,260
Magical chemical reactions
will happen between them.

53
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:28,820
Fanzhou,

54
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,420
can you help me

55
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,900
show them how to do it?

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,960
Can you ask the questions?

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,540
Okay.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,740
Given the choice of anyone in the world,

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,900
whom would you want

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,820
as a dinner guest?

61
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,860
Zhao Fanzhou.

62
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,380
Zhou Xiao.

63
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,420
You just want me

64
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
to pay extra 857 yuan.

65
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:55,980
Next question.

66
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,460
You do it.

67
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,220
I'd like to have a drink.

68
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,420
You do it.

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,260
Share five positive characteristics
you think I have.

70
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:22,860
High EQ.

71
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:24,700
Lovely.

72
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,860
Tender.

73
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,660
Tall.

74
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,950
Beautiful.

75
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,300
Go on.

76
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,620
Big face.

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,620
Sweet smile.

78
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,180

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:51,860
Healthy hair.

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,620
You hit me hard.

85
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,630
How do you feel about your relationship
with your mother?

86
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,360
I think it's not bad.

90
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,500
Zhou Xiao.

91
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,660
Zhou Xiao.

92
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,820
I'm telling you.

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,660
I found Zhao Fanzhou's mind is in sync

94
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,340
with Jia Yichun's.

95
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,260
When I asked them

96
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,860
how they felt about their relationship
with their moms,

97
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,900
both of them suddenly quit.

98
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,060
Oh.

99
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,140
What are you doing?

100
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,220
You two can have a try.

101
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,900
I think your mind must be in sync

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,860
with Cai Yasi's.

103
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,820
It'll be much fun.

104
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,620
Okay.

105
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,100
Let's do it.

106
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,740
No big deal.

107
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,460
I'll start.

108
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,820
Do you feel your childhood was happier

109
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,820
than most other people's?

110
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,780
Sure.

111
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,460
Why do you think so?

112
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,540
We acted in collusion with each other
in our childhood,

113
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,500
so our happiness doubled.

114
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,700
Come on. In collusion?

115
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,460
It's true.

116
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,740
Next question.

117
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,380
When did you last sing to yourself?

118
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,340
When I was having a shower.

119
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,340
It's weird.

120
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,240
It's not.

121
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,940
It is!

122
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,980
Fanzhou,

123
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,740
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,060
I really don't know

125
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,540
there is a question about mother

126
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,340
among the 36 questions about love.

127
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,720
I know.

128
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,700
Thank you for believing me.

129
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,620
Just now,

130
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,100
when we played the game,

131
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,220
Tao Ling said

132
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,860
Zhou Xiao and Cai Yasi

133
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
also grew up together.

134
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,180
So what?

135
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,340
His confession at the school anniversary
was so romantic.

136
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,480
They will be together sooner or later, right?

137
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,660
Growing up together

138
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,680
doesn't mean being together after growing up.

139
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,180
They won't.

140
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,660
Neither will we.

141
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,780
Will the meteor shower appear or not?

142
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm so sleepy.

143
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,020
No.

144
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,390
I can't bear it.

145
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,360
What to do?

146
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,740
As soon as I see you,

147
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,080
I feel like I have trouble breathing.

148
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,270
Zhou Xiao,

149
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,900
I like you.

150
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,820
Don't hang up.

151
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm totally serious.

152
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,260
It has nothing to do with other girls

153
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,500
or boys.

154
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,220
If I had known you'd misunderstand me,

155
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,300
I should've had more decency.

156
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Anyway,

157
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,900
can you be my girlfriend?

more than I can eat!

173
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,980
I want to be the best novelist!

174
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,300
You should look at me

175
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,620
instead of these shooting stars.

176
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,940
Tsk!

177
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,180
Disgusting!

178
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,700
You're sick.

179
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,420
♪... I said, "I'm here. Don't worry."♪

180
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,020

184
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,220
Did you make it safely back home?

185
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,300
Yeah.

186
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,260
I just arrived.

187
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,860
Dad.

188
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,380
Mom.

189
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,340
I'm back.

190
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,340
You're back!

191
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,300
You must be tired after spending
two hours on the train.

192
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,220
It's okay. I'm not tired.

193
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,780
Hurry. Let me give you a hug.

194
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,900
Let me have a look at you.

195
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,260
You've lost weight.

196
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,580
Was the food not tasty?

197
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,420
No, it's fine.

198
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,820
Just tell me what you want to eat.

199
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,980
The fridge is full of foods you like.

200
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,220
I'll cook for you.

201
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,460
I want to eat

202
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,500
Pork Knuckle in Brown Sauce.

203
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,460
No problem.

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,380
Why do I feel like
I'm home loaded with honors?

205
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,020
Stop talking nonsense.

206
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:58,980
Dad, she hit me.

207
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,300
It's alright.

208
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,220
Okay.

209
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,460
Go have a rest in your room.

210
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,700
I'll let you know when the meal is ready.

211
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,260
Okay.

212
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,780
Honey,

213
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,340
why haven't you changed
the bed sheet and quilt cover?

214
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,300
She needs to have a rest.

215
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,060
It'll be done soon.

216
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,940
Look at your dad.

217
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,420
Alright. Sit on the sofa for a while.

218
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,620
I'll go help him.

219
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,260
Look at you.

220
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,140
You didn't come back
during the National Day holiday

221
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,060
and you stopped us from going to see you.

222
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,900
And you didn't let us pick you up.

223
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
She's just back. Stop nagging.

224
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm not.

225
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,380
What a favored child I am.

226
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,300
Don't move.

227
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,940
Leave it to me.

228
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,140
Your gloves

229
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,860
have been polluted.

230
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,320
Zhou Xiao.

231
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,720
Zhou Xiao!

232
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,150
Oh my god.

233
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,480
What's on my mind? I'm crazy.

234
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,980
Come out. Your diet meal is ready.

235
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,700
You've put on much weight
during the Spring Festival.

236
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,180
Hold on.

237
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,340
Just a second.

238
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,300
Mom,

239
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,540
it's so nice of you.

240
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,960
You even take the fruit to me personally.

241
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,750
Mom, what are you doing?

242
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,540
Don't you feel ashamed?

243
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,700
I shouldn't have taken it to you.

244
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,740
During the Spring Festival,

245
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,510
the only thing you've done

246
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,500
is staying in front of your computer.

247
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,820
This computer is just like your mom.

248
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,420
Fine.

249
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,440
Let it take the fruit to you.

250
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,100
Did you wash your hands?

251
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,500
That's a waste of time.

252
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,100
I'll eat like this.

253
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,660
Go wash your hands.

254
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:41,790
You've changed.

255
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,120
What?

256
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,480
I said,

257
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,670
I'm going to wash my hands.

258
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,670
That's more like it.

259
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,240
Come on.

260
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,150
Eat this.

261
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,630
Look at you.

262
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,180
You've put on so much weight.

263
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,540
You've never done exercises.

264
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,700
Why do you prepare so much food
if you think I'm heavy?

265
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,180
Finish this.

266
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,670
Finish this before you're on a diet.

267
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:05,750
Okay.

268
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,320
Alright. I'll put it here.

269
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:13,860
Hmm.

270
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,600
Remember to finish it.

271
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,020
Okay.

272
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,900
Don't forget to wash your hands.

273
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:16,620
Got it.

274
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,240
Have you booked a return ticket?

275
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,460
I'll go pick you up.

276
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,240
He wants to pick me up.

277
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,860
Fanzhou.

278
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,260
Fanzhou.

279
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,820
Come over. Help me deal with

280
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,860
the fingerprints on it.

281
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,000
During the winter vacation,

282
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:07,940
you just spent a few days at home
for the Spring Festival.

283
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,700
You've been staying in the lab every day
since you came back.

284
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,180
Don't you think it's boring?

285
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,270
Don't you want to go out for fun

286
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,110
and relax yourself?

287
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,240
No.

288
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,680
No wonder you can't win her heart.

289
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,030
I'd also ignore you if I were Zhou Xiao.

290
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,270
Professor,

291
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,640
I heard it.

292
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,400
So what?

293
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,310
Did I say anything wrong?

294
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,860
All you know is

295
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,110
checking your phone

296
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,340
and waiting like a fool.

297
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,720
You don't even show up.

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,550
Why does she have to like you?

299
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,270
Professor,

300
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,720
here are the fingerprints.

301
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,200
Do you want to pick me up?

302
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,110
Okay.

303
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,750
It happens I'll have a lot of luggage.

304
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,180
I'll arrive the day after tomorrow.

305
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,680
This doesn't work.

306
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,160
It feels like I'm taking it for granted.

307
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,550
Pick me up?

308
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,900
I hope it's not too much trouble.

309
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:30,350
No way.

310
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,180
It feels like I'm too polite.

311
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:44,510
Why do you want to pick me up?

312
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,860
No.

313
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,350
What if he thinks I'm rejecting him?

314
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,960
How should I respond?

315
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,420
Zhou Xiao,

316
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,100
time for dinner.

317
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:01,660
Got it.

318
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,580
Look at these dishes.

319
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,660
They're both delicious and good-looking.

320
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,300
I have to reward you.

321
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,620
Come on. Honey,

322
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,860
this drum stick is yours.

323
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,680
I don't need it.

324
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm on a diet.

325
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,640
I'll eat it.

326
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,030
No way.

327
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,310
Look at you.

328
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,260
You've put on so much weight.

329
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,900
Then why did you pick up food for me?

330
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
You're inducing me to eat.

331
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,580
You eat.

332
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,180
She's not overweight.

333
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,140
She's not slim, either.

334
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,180
Think of potential problems
in times of peace.

335
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,480
You don't get fat in one day.

336
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
After she goes to school,

337
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,660
she won't have much to eat.

338
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,780
That's good for her.

339
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,380
As a man,

340
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,460
you couldn't understand

341
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,660
how eagerly women want to lose weight

342
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,540
and how important it is.

343
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:53,740
Don't give her too much meat.

344
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,900
Eat. Eat more vegetables.

345
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,540
Pass me your bowl.

346
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,140
Listen to your mom.

347
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:57,940
She's right.

348
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,820
Here. It's yours.

349
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,680
I said I want to lose weight.

350
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,060
Mom, I need to reply to a message.

351
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,460
Don't use your phone while eating.

352
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,380
Just a second.

353
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,260
Happy dating.

354
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,940
PDA

355
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,860
will make you gain weight faster.

356
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,460
Okay.

357
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,580
You know what?

358
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,340
Li was late for work again

359
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,900
this month.

360
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,060
It's the third time.

361
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,700
Jealous?

362
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,200
In this case, ask Zhao Fanzhou
to be your boyfriend.

363
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,260
But in the end,

364
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,660
he used the same excuse.

365
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,300
He said

366
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,060
it was because of traffic jam.

367
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,980
I know you're stubborn
and reluctant to admit it.

368
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,100
Face up to yourself.

369
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,780
Okay?

370
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,900
Why don't you reply?

371
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,620
Zhao Fanzhou said he'd pick me up.

372
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,300
I've been flurried the whole day.

373
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,340
I don't know how to reply.

374
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,310
I think I'm weird.

375
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,860
I want him to pick me up,

376
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,980
but I'm also afraid to see him.

377
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,780
As long as he speaks to me,

378
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,000
my heart beats fast.

379
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,100
I don't know how to reply.

380
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,820
What to do?

381
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,140
It can't be helped. It's a shortcoming.

382
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,020
What's going on?

383
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,380
Stop using your phone during mealtimes.

384
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,880
Sweetie.

385
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,180
Eat.

386
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,140
Eat.

387
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Zhao Fanzhou said he'd pick me up.

388
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,780
I've been flurried the whole day.

389
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,820
I don't know how to reply.

390
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,820
I think I'm weird.

391
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,340
I want him to pick me up,

392
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,540
but I'm also afraid to see him.

393
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,200
As long as he speaks to me,

394
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,500
my heart beats fast.

395
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,580
I don't know how to reply.

396
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,380
What to do?

397
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,780
I've arrived.

398
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,820
When will you arrive?

399
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,020
I'm at the school gate.

400
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,420
I'm going upstairs.

401
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,680
I've brought you lovely presents.

402
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,110
I've brought you delicious food.

403
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,350
Me too.

404
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,580
I've got pig trotters for you.

405
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,980
You finally appeared.

406
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,580
You sent the wrong message to him.

407
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,860
We thought you'd quit college
to avoid embarrassment.

408
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,180
Stop laughing at her,

409
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,420
or she might jump from the moving train.

410
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,070
It was all of a sudden.

411
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,500
If you don't stop,

412
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,380
I'll throw away the pig trotters.

413
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,070
Do you have a lot of luggage?

414
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,550
Do you want us to pick you up?

415
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:00,540
I'm good.

416
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,740
I can do it.

417
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,830
Wei, you're the most kind-hearted.

418
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,220
(Don't answer)

419
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,070
Why don't you pick up the phone?

420
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,020
Hello?

421
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,740
Why are you here?

422
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,180
To pick you up.

423
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,860
How did you know when I'd come back?

424
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,590
Ms. Huang of the library told me.

425
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,020
I shouldn't have asked her for a leave.

426
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,420
Let's go.

427
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,580
Did he read that message

428
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,640
I withdrew?

429
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,830
Do you have a question for me?

430
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,860
Um. No.

431
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,400
No.

432
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,000
I have a question for you.

433
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,440
What?

434
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,620
Why didn't you reply to my message?

435
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,420
I... I didn't see it.

436
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,340
Really?

437
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,180
If you didn't see it,

438
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,110
why did you withdraw a message?

439
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:52,620
That...

440
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:53,880
That what?

441
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,660
That message I withdrew...

442
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,980
What was it about?

443
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,300
Nothing.

444
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,260
I took a selfie.

445
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,100
It's so ugly. I didn't want to scare you.

446
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,440
I sent it to you by accident.

447
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,300
Luckily, you didn't see it.

448
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,660
Luckily.

449
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,140
Yeah, luckily.

450
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:17,940
Here.

451
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,160
Oh.

452
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,740
My mom prepared pig trotters.

453
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,220
I'll give some to you.

454
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,260
It's delicious.

455
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,100
I have one more question.

456
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,160
Go ahead.

457
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,060
Why did it show "Don't answer"

458
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,020
when I called you?

459
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:57,900
It's upset.

460
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,140
I hate warm humid climate most.

461
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,830
Don't remind me.

462
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,900
I found the whole wardrobe
got mildewed when I came back.

463
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,740
You planned to wear it tomorrow, right?

464
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,580
Yeah.

465
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,940
I can't wear it like that.

466
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,300
Wear another one.

467
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,900
Hello.

468
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,060
Hello.

469
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,480
You're back.

470
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,300
My quilt feels wet.

471
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,980
How will we sleep tonight?

472
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,580
Girls, I'm back!

473
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,700
You're back.

474
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,500
Come and do me a favor.

475
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,030
Look. The whole room is humid.

476
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,900
See? Mushrooms grow here.

477
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,580
Let's cook them for dinner.

478
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,660
All you're thinking about is food.

479
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,620
Look at your place

480
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,680
and see if there are mushrooms.

481
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,700
I'm not afraid.

482
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,460
I'll pull them out

483
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,860
and eat them tonight.

484
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,860
Oh.

485
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,540
I've got you pig trotters.

486
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,260
Shall I share it with you

487
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,060
now or later?

488
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,860
Do it later.

489
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,300
Okay.

490
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,500
Lu,

491
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:52,940
cloth.

492
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,500
Catch it.

493
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,420
Wei,

494
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,140
your grandpa is a great craftsman.

495
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,260
It's a cute deer.

496
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,700
My grandpa did it for fun.

497
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,860
I think it's good-looking,

498
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,700
so I asked him to make one for each of you.

499
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,500
So cute.

500
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,900
He's eating.

501
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,700
Mine is cuter.

502
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,260
Mine is cuter.

503
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,310
I don't think so.

504
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,980
A more complicated process
is needed to do this one.

505
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,300
Wei loves me most.

506
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,110
I thought you'd be scared.

507
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,220
No. I love it.

508
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,100
Snake!

509
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,180
Snake.

510
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,340
Snake.

511
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm telling you.

512
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,980
I'm not afraid at all.

513
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,460
Really?

514
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,740
Then I'll put it on your bed.

515
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,510
It'll go into your quilt.

516
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,620
I just got up a little late.

517
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,680
There is even no room left for towels.

518
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:45,780
Right.

519
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,070
It's tiring.

520
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,680
It's fake. Look.

521
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,400
Why do you take it out?

522
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,070
The weather is humid. It's going moldy.

523
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,180
It's not easy to have a sunny day.

524
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,580
I want it to enjoy the sunshine.

525
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,700
Are you treating it as a pet?

526
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,340
Let's hurry,

527
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,700
or the playground will be occupied.

528
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,300
Okay.

529
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:11,460
Fanzhou.

530
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,060
Let's go.

531
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,780
Hurry.

532
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,460
Then take it yourself.

533
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,220
It's too much for me to handle it alone.

534
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,140
Right here.

535
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,460
Don't put it on the ground.

536
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,860
They're from my fans.

537
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,340
These warm humid days

538
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,300
got so many people in trouble.

539
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,380
Fanzhou,

540
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,460
your girl, Zhou Xiao.

541
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,980
Where is my girl, Lu?

542
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:10,980
Zhou Xiao!

543
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,420
The snake...

544
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,740
It's fake.

545
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,620
Oh.

546
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,300
What are you doing here?

547
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,550
Nothing.

548
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,060
Wow. Unbelievable.

549
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,260
Snake!

550
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,620
It's fake.

551
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,460
Stop joking.

552
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,300
Let me show you if it's fake or real.

553
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,780
Have a look.

554
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,180
No.

555
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:06,700
Have a look.

556
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
Stay away from me.

557
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,380
Touch it.

558
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,140
No.

559
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,180
Touch it.

560
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,660
No!

561
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,580
I won't.

562
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,460
Are you a coward?

563
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:12,980
Touch it.

564
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,260
Yes, I am. I'm a coward.

565
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,660
Are you a man?

566
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,780
Lu, I'm going to work in the library.

567
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,980
Okay. I'll take your quilt back.

568
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,380
Bye.

569
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:26,780
Okay.

570
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm leaving.

571
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,220
Why are you following me?

572
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,460
You seem to have forgotten we're colleagues.

573
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,660
I'm going to the library too.

574
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,180
Go down.

575
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,060
Up.

576
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,510
It's enough. What else do you want?

577
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,940
Fine. Forget about it
if you don't want to talk to me.

578
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:24,580
I'm busy too.

579
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,160
Hi, Chen Yu.

580
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:41,780
Lu,

581
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,180
what's up?

582
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,940
I guess because it's warm
and humid these days

583
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,340
and I haven't used my racket for a long time,

584
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,260
the string is broken.

585
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,220
Let me cut it

586
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,460
and then get it repaired.

587
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,500
Okay.

588
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,070
Hold it.

589
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,300
I'll show you.

590
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,270
The third one is like this.

591
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,140
Cut it.

592
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,940
Then here.

593
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:10,940
The fourth one.

594
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,220
It's broken.

595
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
Have a try.

596
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,500
Okay.

597
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,580
Cut...

598
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,980
Right. 1. 2. 3. 4.

599
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,620
Right. Here.

600
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,180
Okay.

601
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,550
Right. In this case,

602
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,660
the racket is balanced.

603
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:35,660
Then it won't

604
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,180
get crooked.

605
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:36,900
Down.

606
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:37,740
Left.

607
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,060
Right. Cut in four directions.

608
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,300
Add little by little.

609
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:40,820
Coach.

610
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,620
Coach.

611
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,820
Okay.

612
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,700
Let's continue.

613
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,940
Closed for dehumidification.

614
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,180
Why didn't they tell us?

615
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,180
They gave notice in the library group.

616
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,110
They asked us to come here in the afternoon.

617
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,820
Weird.

618
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,220
Now that you knew it's closed,

619
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,100
why did you follow me here

620
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,400
and not tell me about it?

621
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,480
I wanted to have a walk with you.

622
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,020
I'm going to have lunch.

623
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,300
Me too.

624
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,190
Just go ahead.

625
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,140
You don't need to tell me.

626
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,710
I'm going over there.

627
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:42,920
What are you doing?

628
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,710
Thank you.

629
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,860
You're welcome.

630
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,340
Sir, I'm okay with everything.

631
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:00,940
Anything is fine.

632
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,580
What on earth does Zhao Fanzhou want to do?

633
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,860
Thank you.

634
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,380
I wish he couldn't find me.

635
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,400
Don't find me.

636
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,960
Don't you hate to eat carrot?

637
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,500
I got the wrong dish.

638
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,400
Do you eat it?

639
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,500
I haven't started.

640
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,480
No, I don't.

641
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,340
Why?

642
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,320
You said you like it.

643
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,760
I lied.

644
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:22,840
Why?

645
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,510
Because you said Cai Yasi ate it for you too.

646
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,140
So what?

647
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,000
So I was angry.

648
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,190
I'm full.

649
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,220
Enjoy it.

650
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,030
I can do it too.

651
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,900
When I learned to repair a racket string,

652
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,500
Chen Yu was still sieving soybeans
with a racket.

653
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
How dare they flirt in the presence of me?

654
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,840
Do they think I'm dead?

655
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,880
Don't you think they've gone too far?

656
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:12,780
Yes.

657
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,220
And Lu.

658
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,580
I don't understand why she blushed.

659
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:19,780
Right?

660
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,140
Has she thought about me?

661
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,460
I don't think I'm inferior to Chen Yu.

662
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,820
Why didn't she blush for me?

663
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:26,820
Look.

664
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,980
Other girls blushed so much
at the sight of me

665
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,060
that they even needed to go to hospital.

666
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,900
But she acted as if she's blind.

667
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,920
Hey.

668
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,070
Are you listening or not?

669
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,580
No.

670
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,100
You're looking down

671
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,060
upon my relationship, right?

672
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,420
Could it be that your relationship

673
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,580
is working more smoothly than mine?

674
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,380
Oh.

675
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
Well. Give me more details.

676
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,700
Have you decided to tell her how you feel?

677
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,340
You've been asking me for an hour.

678
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,340
Well.

679
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,020
Look.

680
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,340
We got to know them almost at the same time.

681
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,340
Why is your relationship

682
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,220
going well

683
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,860
while mine is full of ups and downs?

684
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,620
Look.

685
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,060
I'm more handsome than you.

686
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,860
I'm also richer

687
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,500
and more successful in career.

688
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,540
Why do I have

689
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,460
a bumpy relationship?

690
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,300
It's good.

691
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,500
This Chuanchuan store is great.

692
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,060
Hmm.

693
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,140
Add it into our favorites.

694
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,140
Look at Tao Ling.

695
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,700
Tao Ling.

696
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,780
Are you sure you won't eat?

697
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,500
Yes.

698
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,500
Are you crazy?

699
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,260
Why do you suddenly want to lose weight?

700
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,030
Summer is coming.

701
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,540
I can't hide my thick thighs anymore.

702
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,220
In this case,

703
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,460
just relax

704
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,620
and enjoy the food.

705
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,140
Shut up. You bad girl.

706
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,980
Don't come over.

707
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,500
Smell it.

708
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,140
It's tempting

709
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
and mouthwatering.

710
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,180
Zhou Xiao, I'll kill you.

711
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,780
Take a bite before you do that.

712
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,540
No.

713
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,660
Have a taste.

714
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,540
I won't.

715
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,260
Wei, take her away.

716
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,500
It smells so good.

717
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,660
Alright.

718
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,760
Stop joking.

719
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,540
Who is it?

720
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,380
I've fixed your racket.

721
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,100
I'll take it to you when it's convenient.

722
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,860
Give it back to me.

723
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
What are you doing?

724
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,180
Are you in a relationship?

725
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:12,580
No.

726
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,280
Tell us the truth, or we won't
consider you as our sister.

727
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,700
Sit down.

728
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,180
I agree.

729
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,620
You'd better tell us the truth.

730
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,260
Hmm.

731
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:28,220
Go ahead.

732
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,860
Tell us.

733
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,300
Fine.

734
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,710
I'll tell you.

735
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,580
He's Chen Yu.

736
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,980
I told you about him.

737
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,940
Obviously, your relationship is moving fast.

738
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,380
Last time

739
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,100
we watched the meteor shower together.

740
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,070
After that, he's nice to me.

741
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,580
And

742
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,260
we often have a chat

743
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,260
in our spare time.

744
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,620
Then seize the time and let him
be your boyfriend.

745
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,940
Yeah. I've decided

746
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,580
to tell him how I feel.

747
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,020
Lu, you're true to your name.

748
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,280
Stop looking.

749
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,230
Can't I celebrate Lu's love story?

750
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,190
It's good.

751
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,620
(Next Episode)

752
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,300
Stop hiding.

753
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,780
I need to talk to you.

754
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,460
I like you.

755
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,020
Let me buy you dinner to thank you.

756
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,060
Sure. It'll be my pleasure.

757
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:49,060
