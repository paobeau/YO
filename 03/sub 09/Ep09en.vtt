How come...

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.540
you always keep showing up?

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.650
It is really a coincidence. I'll go.

14
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.670
How come...

15
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.810
you are this pretty?

16
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.540
And if I am pretty?

17
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.710
What comes after that?

18
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410

<i>It's already awkward. Oh so awkward! </i>

32
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.620
Look at that. It's like in the movies!

33
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.660
<i>What? I'm jealous!</i>

34
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.230
<i> What should I say? Actually, please don't say anything.</i>

35
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.490
It was like in the movies, right?

36
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920
Yeah, m-movies. M-movies.

37
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.200
Oh, I didn't realize there were so many people.

38
00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.150
That, I... s-should we grab that and go?

39
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.560
Shall we go?

40
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.760
Wow! So nice!

41
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.080
I enjoyed it tonight.

42
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.490
Oh, I'm not saying that I enjoyed it, but...

43
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.110
Me too. I missed you, and I was happy that I saw you.

44
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.650
How can you...

45
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.890
How can you make someone fall like this?

46
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.660
I am saying this in case you start thinking a lot.

47
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.070
It wasn't a mistake.

48
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.760
I...

49
00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.120
I like you.

50
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.480
I apologize that my confession took so long.

51
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:22.930
From now on, let's not worry about what comes next but be curious.

52
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.910
Okay.

53
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.480
Sleep well.

54
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.080
Sleep well.

61
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.970
Chief Kim, what do you think?

62
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.020
It's tasty.

63
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.570
It's really delicious. This is a good restaurant.

64
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.460
Chief Kim, shall we promote Deputy Editor Jang to Chief Editor?

65
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.390
Her reputation may be bad but she is very good at her job.

66
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:56.620
However, b-because of her reputation, there may be problems...

67
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.220
Vice President, you should do as you please.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.160
Cheers!

69
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.010
At first, I was searching externally.

70
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:20.530
For someone who is good at planning advertisement content.

71
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.130
Even so, I can't just act on my own impulses.

72
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:31.730
Since I need to listen to my coworkers' opinions, think about it well, and share with me your opinion.

73
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.660
In any case, if the advertising revenue continues to fall, it hardly matters whether they're the editor or head of advertising.

74
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.360
One of them will have to take responsibility.

75
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.080
You are right, this is a good restaurant.

76
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.340
Cheers!

Yoon Jaeyoung, that watermelon punk.

87
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.870
For the flimsiest reason, you make my mom babysit Doha. Are you even human?

88
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.290
You can't even do your own laundry when you are not even a child.

89
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:13.290
Aunt's washing machine does Doha's laundry, so how could I put mine there? There's something called a conscience.

90
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.610
What type of silly logic is that?

91
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.170
Why do you put your dirty laundry in my laundry basket?

92
00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.250
Did you sleep well?

93
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:28.370
Yes. You need to wear your tie properly.

94
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.120
Morning coffee.

95
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.380
Did you come to pick me up?

96
00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:41.390
Hmmm... I usually don't like waiting but I was excited.

97
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.130
Goosebumps.

98
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:51.030
Ah, you two are carpooling as colleagues. That is a good culture.

99
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:56.110
Yeah. Something like that. I am heading off now, Jaeyoung.

100
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.420
Okay, have a good day.

101
00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.040
- I'll be heading off, too. 
 - Sure, it was nice to see you. Good morning.

102
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.310
What was that?

103
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.990
Today, your contact lens look really pretty.

104
00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.250
I am not wearing lens.

105
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.520
My girlfriend. 
 <i>(T/N: In Korean pronunciation, "lens" and the end of the word "girlfriend" can sound similar.)</i>

106
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.700
- Wow. 
 - Oh, and also...

107
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.110
- I think I am starting to lose hair. 
 - Where?

108
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.320
- Here 
 - Here?

109
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:37.960
I can't break free from your charm. 
 <i>(T/N: The Korean word for "break-free" sounds like the English word "hair.")</i>

110
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.200
He must be crazy!

111
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.640
<i>Come here.</i>

112
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:52.920
Oh my, what's going on?

113
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.450
- What's happened to him? 
 - Quickly get in.

114
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:16.620
Good morning, Editor Choi.

115
00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.150
Why are you riding a bicycle today?

116
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.280
I plan to commute to and from work by bicycle.

117
00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:24.860
Is it your fantasy to commute to work by bicycle while carrying a backpack?

118
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.670
If you do that, you will hurt your thighs.

119
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.730
I am trying to save on motor fees.

120
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.440
If I save ₩800,000 ($800) in two months, I will have ₩1,600,000($1600).

121
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.810
If I split the ₩900,000 ($900) remaining cost of the ring across 12 months, it will cost ₩75,000 ($75) every month.

122
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.540
Of course, this is without interest.

123
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.440
If I save ₩60,000 ($60) on motor fees each month,

124
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.520
then I will only need to pay ₩15,000 ($15) a month.

125
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.000
Why are you explaining in such detail?

126
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.550
Are you trying to make me feel uncomfortable?

127
00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:02.280
No. You asked why I was riding a bicycle. I was only explaining the reason.

128
00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.530
If that made you feel uncomfortable, I apologize. I will head off first.

129
00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.530
I guess I should think again.

130
00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.830
He lacks flexibility.

131
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.070
Who needs Cartier? I spoke too rashly.

132
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.590
I'll walk you just to the front.

133
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.430
- What if someone sees us? 
 - People can't see us together?

134
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.780
We are like an office-couple, so we should keep it a secret.

135
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.760
Office-couple?

136
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:54.460
I'm not going to start playing hard to get at this point.

137
00:12:55.310 --> 00:13:01.060
My first ever confession sounded so sweet like 100 Dalgonas.

138
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.390
Do office-couples have to be secret?

139
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.940
I have never dated someone at work before.

140
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.740
Me neither.

141
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.690
But I wanted to show you off.

142
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:16.660
I thought you said you wouldn't fall for me. When exactly did you fall?

143
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.710
Every time you got embarrassed in front of me.

144
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:26.400
Every time you acted disgracefully, I fell for you.

145
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.190
But I can't keep acting disgracefully.

146
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:38.700
It's suddenly making me worry. What do I do with this man? Calling me disgraceful?

147
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.150
I am no longer worried about anything.

148
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:47.240
I have crossed the line, and there is no return.

149
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.410
Even if...

150
00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.220
there comes a moment

151
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.040
when you are disappointed in me,

152
00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.010
please take responsibility and protect

153
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.330
your affections until the very end.

154
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.980
What about your affection for me?

155
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.330
I will protect my affection.

156
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.300
I know myself and I trust myself.

157
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.230
Whatever happens to me, I won't flinch,

158
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:22.390
so you have to adore me until the end.

159
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.820
- Okay. Promise! 
 - Promise.

160
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.270
Let's date beautifully for a long time without being caught.

161
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.800
Oh! Oh, there...

162
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.200
- What's going on? 
 - I hate it.

163

<i>[The moments we say it's love.] </i>

164
00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.490
Hello.

165
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.050
Oh! You came early. Tea? Coffee?

166
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.560
I already had coffee.

167
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.060
It feels so nice now that we don't have any pressing deadlines, right?

168
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.190
Bro!

169
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.410
Sorry, just don't kill me.

170
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.280
I wanted you and Hari to stay close. It's not because I didn't want to work.

171
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.700
Hey, this gives me rashes, and it's so itchy!

172
00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.660
Seeing both of you indecisive idiots made me feel so frustrated that I just—

173
00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.570
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.600
- Bro, thank you. 
 - Hm?

175
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.050
As expected, I only have you.

176
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.430
I'll make sure I stick close to her.

177
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.900
I'm going to stick close to her for 52 hours a week.

178
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.880
Huh?

179
00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.280
Have you two... Did you give up on being celibate?

180
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.620
Hari doesn't believe in marriage either.

181
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.730
What about the baby?

182
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.860
What about... Hari's baby?

183
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.020
I'll have to believe in a miracle.

184
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.160
<i>- I... think I've started losing hair. 
 - Here?</i>

185
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.700
<i>Here. I can't break free</i>

186
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:34.240
<i>from your charms.
</i>

187
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.800
Oh, yeah, it's me.

188
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.950
You'll come when we take pictures of Doha's party, right?

189
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.360
Come. You're the one who introduced the place to me.

190
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.110
When it ends, we should eat and watch a movie.

191
00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:08.070
Why should I go and watch a movie with you?

192
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:13.650
You promised to watch it. Keep your promise! I'm hanging up.

193
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.760
Huh?

194
00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:25.420
He has become the most persistent of beggars. Doing all sorts.

195
00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.260
So childish, Yoon Jaeyoung!

196
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.090
Keep your promise! Come on!

197
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.790
Senior! What's with you? With Chief Han!

198
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:44.140
Huh? Eating together and holding hands!

199
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.440
- Hey. 
 - I saw you doing all kinds of things.

200
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.730
You two, really... Oh my, oh my!

201
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.490
Come here. Come on!

202
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.600
That's right.

203
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.860
Come here quickly.

204
00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:06.650
What's going on?

205
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:08.680
Why are you acting like a bully all of a sudden?

206
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.840
I've never encountered this even when I was in school.

207
00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.820
This... is expensive.

208
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:16.830
Have the rumors already started?

209
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.620
How much did you hear?

210
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.720
Hah! Wait, wait.

211
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.300
How far did you go?

212
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.540
Huh? Where would I go?

213
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.630
We didn't do anything.

214
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.640
But you were doing a lot of things outside.

215
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:39.060
Let's go easy on her. She said "we."

216
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:41.530
Okay, it's good! It's set!

217
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.030
Senior!

218
00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.020
Congratulations! I really thought it wasn't going to work for you...

219
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:49.230
Fighting!

220
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.570
Now...

221
00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.570
Let's end this gossip with you guys.

222
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.360
I've gotten enough attention at work.

223
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:00.810
Yesterday was Day 1, what if gossip spreads and ruins it?

224
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.860
I want it to last a long time.

225
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:09.290
Everlasting love? A love that lasts 100 years?

226
00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:13.250
Hari, even though we get to hear top trends and gossip 
one month later than anyone.

227
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:18.240
Even then, we are very quick-witted and insightful so you need to be careful.

228
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.970
Of course! I'll be careful.

229
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:25.900
Then... has your pregnancy project ended?

230
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:30.860
Oh, Han Yisang doesn't like kids.

231
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.260
What?

232
00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:39.020
Come on!  The entire staff and even our subscribers know you want kids! I'm sure he's thinking of it.

233
00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.420
Right?

234
00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:44.930
I mean, isn't your goal to break the speed limit? (getting pregnant before marriage)

235
00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:48.800
Even if I have to hit full speed on the autobahn,

236
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.740
we've only dated for a day, so... talking about pregnancy is a little too fast.

237
00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:57.230
I'm thinking it's something we'll end up discussing even if I  don't specifically plan it out.

238
00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.040
We are old enough, and we've already kissed, so—

239
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.800
- Kiss? 
 - You kissed?!

240
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.890
Oh my goodness! You already did that?

241
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.210
Oh my gosh!

242
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:15.220
That's so good! Yay!

243
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:21.130
You said you would take care of this!

244
00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.640
What is this sloppy job you have done?

245
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.370
<i>How many times do I have to tell you for you to understand?</i>

246
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:29.100
<i>Get back to work!</i>

247
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:34.230
Is there anything you can do correctly?

248
00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.500
Oh, Daughter.

249
00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.820
What's going on? Calling me suddenly.

250
00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:02.630
London?

251
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.670
How are you going to go there alone?

252
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.330
How can I leave work?

253
00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.610
Does she have to get lessons from a professor?

254
00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:14.380
I mean I can use my vacation days from the summer,

255
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.870
- but I have some work to do at the company. 
 - She's not even a middle schooler yet.

256
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:21.750
Why is she already preparing for the entrance exam?

257
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.980
Anyway, I feel too bad to go on a trip and have fun.

258
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:32.000
Who said I wasn't proud of our kid? I also want her to be the next Mozart.

259
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.410
Huh? Mozart didn't like the flute?

260
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.810
All I'm saying is... that we should live within our means.

261
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:44.580
- Dad... 
 - I'm... 
- ...having a hard time.

262
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.100
- Oh... Okay... 
 - Let's talk later.

263
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.540
Yes.

264
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.710
I'm going up right now.

265
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.420
I'm on my way. Come up slowly. Okay?

266
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.510
I'm on my way to you.

267
00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:31.360
I'm coming down right now.

268
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:37.040
You're coming, right? Wait, wait, wait.

269
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.200
What about your seniors? I don't know. They all went somewhere.

270
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.760
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

271
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.330
Change of plans! Change of plans. 1st floor.

272
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.030
- Is someone there? 
 - The company workers don't use these stairs though.

273
00:22:56.030 --> 00:23:00.050
- Is there another office couple beside us? 
 - There might be.

274
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:03.600
We're already occupying this place.

<i>Go somewhere else.</i>

276
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.710
Did you pack your lunch?

277
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:26.260
I want to save the lunch costs. Let's say lunch usually costs about 8,000 won ($8), and I often eat out for dinner, too.

278
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:31.500
If I save about 300,000 won ($300) a month, I can save back up the amount I had

279
00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:35.140
before I bought the ring in just six months.

280
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.250
No... Just don't buy the Cartier ring.

281
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.590
You should buy the one that's 18k. If you get a cheap ring, you'll get rejected for seeming cheap.

282
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.830
To be honest, since this is my first confession,

283
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.920
I want to do well.

284
00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.870
It's my first time liking someone this much

285
00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:03.900
and I hope she likes me and my confession.

286
00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.170
I'm like a fool, right?

287
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:15.130
Yes. Well... I didn't know you were this much of a fool.

288
00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.480
Will this be enough? Let's go and eat something tasty.

289
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.160
- Ah, it's okay. It's good to save. 
 - No... No.

<i>[Emergency Spicy Rice Cake]</i>

291
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.140
Everything tastes good when we eat together.

292
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.630
Aigoo, is it tasty, my baby? To the point that you have sauce on your mouth?

293
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:43.830
My goodness, my goodness.

294
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.650
How cute. How cute.

295
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.640
But... this is unexpectedly thrilling.

296
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:58.140
I found out that people have small intervals of dates in places like the pantry and in front of the copier.

297
00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:03.450
I thought you said all the reporters already knew? And Soocheol already knows. Can this really be called a secret?

298
00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.340
But only they know.

299
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.080
Since they're my people, they are loyal to these types of things.

300
00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.900
But... I feel like you'll get caught because you're too obvious, Hari.

301
00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:19.870
Am I... Hari now?

302
00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.600
Well, if you like nicknames... Cutie?

303
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:27.480
Oh, no way!

304
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:33.180
Because I'm brusque, I can never do, "Hari wants this!"

305
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.190
Wow.

306
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:41.100
This is a big problem. A big problem. You're so cute that I'm getting angry.

307
00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:47.890
You should only do this in front of me. If you do it in front of others, I'll just... You can't!

308
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.930
But don't you think we'll get caught here?

309
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:57.460
There's a spicy rice cake shop in front of our company.

310
00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.170
And between us colleagues,

311
00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:04.590
we can eat together. It's not like we're getting caught while kissing.

314
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:17.070
♫ <i> A feeling like I'm falling in love </i>♫

315
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:18.910
Deputy Editor!

316
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:29.420
It was a game to see who pays. The person who makes a sound first loses. Since we tied, let's do half-half. Move aside!

317
00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:33.630
Gosh, I was so surprised.

318
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:38.750
I'm only saying this cause she said all the reporters know, but it's a bit thrilling.

319
00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:47.040
I don't know why they're like that, but it must be fun.

320
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.460
We should also do the same later.

321
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.860
I... I don't know what it is, but we should do it later.

322
00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.640
Ah, it'll be fun!

323
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:03.460
I'm sorry.

324
00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:07.870
I thought it wouldn't seem real if I pinched you softly.

325
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.350
It's okay.

326
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:13.200
But your strength... Wow!

327
00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.870
I agreed to take pictures of Kang Hyojoo.

328
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:27.320
Since she said she's getting her body in tip-top shape, it'll probably be next month?

329
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.190
Kang Hyojoo.

330
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.120
Why? Should I not take the photos?

331
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.130
What do you mean? I draw firm boundaries between business and personal.

332
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.090
You should take the photos so well that I explode with jealousy.

333
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.800
Oh~ As expected, my girlfriend.

334
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.050
Professional! So cool.

335
00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.620
Ah. I am cool.

336
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:53.070
What's the point of us keeping our mouths shut?

337
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:58.860
They say a yawn, a burp, a sneeze, and love can't be hidden.

338
00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:01.180
Is love in that category?

339
00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:05.390
Love... is instinctual.

340
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.970
But still, burp is...

341
00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:20.490
Goodness...

342
00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:31.410
Goodnight.

343
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.130
- You're excited. 
 - Why are you out?

344
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:50.420
Are you... really dating that jerk?

345
00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:54.850
He's not a jerk but Chief Han or Han Yisang.

346
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:56.170
Okay.

347
00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.700
Are you seriously dating Chief Han Yisang?

348
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.890
Then do you think I'm meeting him to have fun for a short while in this urgent situation?

349
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.820
He's someone I've waited for for ten years.

350
00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.860
Yesterday... was day one.

351
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.150
Day one my butt.

352
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:20.320
Why are you counting the days? Are you checking beforehand how many days it'll take for you to break up?

353
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.700
You're picking a fight because you're lonely, right? I'm counting because I'm planning to go for 3-9,000 days.

354
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.670
Ugh, really, that behavior of yours.

355
00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.150
You better come to Doha's party when we take pictures!

356
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.350
<i>Okay!</i>

357
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:34.370
You promised!

358
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:43.180
This little!

359
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:01.130
They said we need to retake the sandbox shots from before.

360
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.810
What's the reason?

361
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:08.700
I got the outfit sponsorship based on the pictorial concept,  but they said that the outfits are too flashy.

362
00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.770
I mean, can't kids play around with designer clothes?

363
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.290
Deputy Editor Jang said that?

364
00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:15.860
Then who would it be?

365
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.560
This person really won't do.

366
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.710
W-Who? Senior Hari?

367
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.910
Her judgment...

368
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:33.180
is so accurate. I can't say no.

369
00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.500
Your reaction makes me cringe.

370
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.470
You've totally lost it...

371
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.680
Thanks to that, you're getting it reshot.

372
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.670
Since you say it's thanks to that, let me tip you off.

373
00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.750
Hari wants to run the A1 Grand Prix.

374
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.780
She dreams of breaking the speed limit, but she's shy and has a lot of romantic dreams

375
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.260
so she's probably abiding by the speed limit.

376
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.240
You understand what I'm saying, right?

377
00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:35.010
<i> What if someone you love appears? What if you have a child without meaning to?</i>

378
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.370
<i> Have you never wanted to be a father?</i>

379
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.470
<i> The two of them nearly got caught by Eutteum kissing at the spicy rice cake shop.</i>

380
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.830
<i>They were about to get caught by Seungho and I at the emergency exit stairs.</i>

381
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.350
<i> Do you think they don't know what secretly dating means?</i>

382
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.170
<i> Maybe they're wanting to be found out?</i>

383
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:19.600
Kids...

384
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.520
Aren't you being too blatant about your gossiping?

385
00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:31.600
It's so obvious when you all stop at once like that,

386
00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.140
you little sneaks.

387
00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.380
- Oh... Senior. 
 - Hm?

388
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.240
There is a company announcement.

389
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.860
Let's see. Let's see.

390
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.670
<i>[Personnel Notification]</i>

391
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.090
<i>[From Deputy to Acting Editor in Chief. The Baby Editorial Department. Jang Hari]</i>

392
00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.680
<i>[From Deputy to Acting Editor in Chief. The Baby Editorial Department. Jang Hari]</i>

393
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.050
Manager.

394
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.120
You should come and see me.

395
00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:34.600
Like the Chief Editor Shin, why do you talk with your eyes?

396
00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.080
Tell me everything you know.

397
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.480
What?

398
00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:44.550
You men are banding together because the company has more female employees.

399
00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:49.720
When the general manager notified me of my position, without saying anything,

400
00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:52.100
he would have prepared for my opposition.

401
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:56.450
I think that provides your consent.

402
00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.240
Wow...

403
00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:04.040
I didn't know you were this smart.

404
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.060
I've always consistently been smart.

405
00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:10.480
And my temper is the same.

406
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.410
So who are they bringing in?

407
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.130
They're looking for someone outside the company.

408
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.620
Someone who is good at planning the advertisement contents.

409
00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:27.030
I was also troubled.

410
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.060
I really, to be honest, wanted to take your side.

411
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.510
But if the advertisement sales drop again, they said they'll fire either you or me, so what could I do?

412
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:40.530
I'm the breadwinner of my household. At this age, with my abilities.

413
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.080
There is no place for me to get re-employed.

414
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.080
I also have a lot of years and experience!

415
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:50.210
My God, really.

416
00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:56.380
I can go, right?

417
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.770
Damn.

418
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.480
I'm sorry.

419
00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:06.720
I'm going crazy.

420
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.450
<i>I heard the news from Soocheol.</i>

421
00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:18.030
<i> Shall I go there right now?</i>

422
00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.440
<i>[Don't worry about it.  I know I have you by my side, so I'm not afraid of trouble.]</i>

423
00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:47.610
Seeing as you're leisurely enjoying a hobby in the afternoon,

424
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.270
you must not be an office worker.

425
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:55.220
I'm a freelance photographer. I take photos.

426
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.810
That's a cool job.

427
00:35:58.810 --> 00:36:01.970
How did you think of doing leather crafts?

428
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.520
Doing something I've never done is my hobby.

429
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:08.190
Oh my. Oh my, me too.

430
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.150
It's because I was unable to do a lot when I was younger.

431
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.960
At my age, what else can we do except for hobbies?

432
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:23.250
I also started because my life wasn't fun.

433
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.550
I needed to have some meaning.

434
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.110
Otherwise, I felt like I was going to disappear.

435
00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:32.790
How could a young person

436
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.600
think similarly to me?

437
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.010
Have you not married yet?

438
00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.860
No, not yet.

439
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:46.650
Oh my, that's good. I know someone really well who is a building heiress,

440
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:49.090
would you like to meet her?

441
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:54.120
Although she isn't a building heiress,

442
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.730
I have a very cool and pretty girlfriend.

443
00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:02.610
It hasn't been that long since we started dating, but I want to treat her well and look good for her

444
00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:07.010
so that I can make sure she sticks around.

445
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.670
Is that so?

446
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:14.220
You should just have acted like you had one from the start! Why did you act like there were special circumstances?

447
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.110
<i>[Resignation]</i>

448
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:31.020
Manager Jang,

449
00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:33.070
are you really going to act recklessly like this?

450
00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:37.780
It's been 30 years since The Baby started, and I've been a part of it for about half of its life.

451
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:40.210
Without missing a single one.

452
00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.690
I know! That's why I appreciate you.

453
00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:49.820
But, regardless, I'm doing my job, so I can't help it if you're disappointed!

454
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.970
That's why I told you to move onto another publication last time.

455
00:37:54.970 --> 00:38:00.160
Until a new spot opens, work at "the baby" and then look somewhere else.

456
00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:07.970
Since you've judged myself as inadequate for editor-in-chief, it's only right for me to resign.

457
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.900
If you quit so suddenly, how will anyone create the magazine?!

458
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.890
You acted because you thought I wouldn't quit, didn't you?

459
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:25.650
Why are you abusing my loyalty?

460
00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.430
All right.

461
00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:33.220
If you're acting like this because you're hurt,

462
00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:36.010
tell me what you want!

463
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.860
You need to negotiate, why are you taking drastic measures?!

464
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:43.350
Because the position of editor-in-chief isn't on the negotiation table.

465
00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:47.090
General Manager, I'm not doing this because I'm angry.

466
00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:52.620
Apart from the issue I caused, there is also the fact that I am single without a baby of my own.

467
00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:57.130
If I became an example, the junior employees who are talented but unmarried will suffer.

468
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:00.110
I should at least fight like this.

469
00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.560
Are you saying the comprehensive evaluation is unfair?

470
00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.460
Please judge according to skill and ability.

471
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.410
If I'm still lacking then,

472
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.750
I'll leave without any regrets.

473
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:15.560
Hey, wait—

474
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:30.830
Here we go.

475
00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.960
Your wrist is hurting, right? I bought an extra one while I was buying mine.

476
00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:39.710
Oh, wow. Oh, thank you!

477
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.740
No worries.

478
00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.530
Some lucky girl got a good one.

479
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.280
Welcome!

480
00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.580
Two iced Americanos, please.

481
00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.190
Which type of coffee beans would you like?

482
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:10.910
The Yirgacheffe, please.

483
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:14.750
Excellent! Perfect choice.

484
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.910
What's up with the pain-relieving patches? Did you hurt yourself?

485
00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.570
No, it's nothing.

486
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.460
In any case, good job.

487
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:30.580
I've also wanted to throw a resignation letter and quit before, too.

488
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:35.720
It wasn't a big deal. I should've done it earlier and more angrily.

489
00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:37.510
Really good job.

490
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:40.770
I don't have anywhere to go. I don't know if I made a mistake.

491
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:45.510
What will happen to the next book? Will the girls be able to make one on their own?

492
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.110
I mean, I don't have a child, but it's not like I don't have the ability.

493
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:54.280
- You have the ability! 
 - What's the purpose of dealing with all this contempt and disdain?

494
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.230
Contempt and disdain!

495
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.570
- They're losing out. 
 - Yes, they're losing out.

496
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.930
The girls are worried that they'll end up like me.

497
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:08.440
But if I end up getting fired, it'll be a good lesson to not become like me. Right?

498
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.860
What is this?

499
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.490
Tada!

500
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:25.520
This is not something I just picked up. It's a first,

501
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:30.340
but I made this craftsmanship with all of my soul.

502
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.020
- You made it? 
 - Yeah.

503
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.160
- Doctor... 
 - Yes?

504
00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.870
What... are you doing?

505
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:53.660
I'm assessing—

506
00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:01.660
I apologize, it looked like you were in pain.

507
00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.820
All right, let's take a look.

508
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:06.590
It's okay, it's okay.

509
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.700
Doctor,

510
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:23.160
aren't you going to pick up Doha? It's past pickup time.

511
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.230
Yoon Jaeyoung, what are you doing?

512
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.370
Bye! Get home safe!

513
00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:45.370
- Oh, Dad, hello! 
 - Sorry, I'm late. I got caught up at work.

514
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.340
Where's Doha?

515
00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:51.730
Because we couldn't get ahold of you, we called the auntie-grandmother.

516
00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.150
She just picked her up.

517
00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:57.110
Auntie?

518
00:42:57.730 --> 00:42:59.990
Apologies.

519
00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.900
- Hey, pretty girl. 
 - Auntie!

520
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.920
- Sorry! I'll take her. 
 - Did you have a lot of patients?

521
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.160
It's okay.  I brought the stroller so I could take her home.

522
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.980
What good is it to keep her at the clinic? She can't shake her cough.

523
00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.990
I'm sorry I keep burdening both you and Doha.

524
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:29.010
I also didn't know that I would be taking care of your kid, but what can you do?

525
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.820
I feel bad for both you and Doha.

526
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.150
I didn't mean to do this.

527
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.840
I keep realizing after I miss out.

528
00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.670
How do you have the luxury to get faint-hearted while raising a child on your own?

529
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:46.650
If you don't get your act together, I'm not going to watch Doha.

530
00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.850
All right. I'm always thankful, Auntie.

531
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:51.150
Go.

532
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.890
- Get home safe. 
 - All right.

533
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:57.230
Oh, my little baby.

534
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.020
Ah, geez.

535
00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:02.910
Ah, I don't think we'll get the call.

536
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:05.340
Wasn't the message for you to quit in the first place?

537
00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:07.880
- Senior, did you really say you were going to quit? 
 - Yes.

538
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.350
Don't you need to fight with your life in order to live?

539
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:12.570
But you could really lose your life.

540
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.150
I guess we'll get a new editor-in-chief.

541
00:44:15.150 --> 00:44:18.410
Why are you acting out of character? You should've just clung on like you always do!

542
00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.780
I can just quit! This is gross and unfair! I didn't want to do it!

543
00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.260
Ah!

544
00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.460
What about us?

545
00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:31.210
Yes, this is Jang Hari. Yes, General Manager?

546
00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:35.030
Yes.

547
00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:42.480
So we just need to move forward with "The Mom" just like before?

548
00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:45.040
The president is sensitive to the readers' reactions.

549
00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.290
If we gather all the readers who left,

550
00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:48.990
they'll give me the editor-in-chief position.

551
00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:53.070
No matter what, it sounds like they're asking you to resign.

552
00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:55.340
- Right? 
 - Hey.

553
00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.150
It's better to sort it all out amidst the readers' opposition before getting promoted.

554
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:06.060
Since they're suspicious of your content knowledge skills, let's show them that.

555
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.910
You're so smart.

556
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:17.470
There is an idea that I've been thinking about.

557
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:19.180
But will it work?

558
00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.100
What is it?

559
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:50.730
<i>Soyoon!</i>

560
00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:53.160
<i>- X! 
 - That's right.</i>

561
00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.520
<i>W-What do you think you're doing?!</i>

562
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.960
<i>[the baby Editing Department]</i>

563
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.940
<i>[Beat Chief Reporter Jang Hari!]</i>

564
00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.110
No one's arrived yet.

565
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:39.720
All right.

566
00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.900
Good!

567
00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:45.700
Ugh, seriously. You don't want to?

568
00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.190
Why don't you want to?

569
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.920
You have to wear it to be pretty. Dad wants you to look pretty in this.

570
00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:53.800
You have a lot of confidence in your beauty.

571
00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:55.600
Wait!

572
00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:59.410
Let's call a referee. What is she doing?

573
00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:07.390
Bring it.

574
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.620
<i>[I can't pick a picture of Do Ah. Come over right away after work.]</i>

575
00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.160
Welcome!

576
00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.950
Hello!

577
00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.770
Please take a seat.

578
00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:27.080
It is a question regarding infant care. Its level is of the highest difficulty.

579
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:30.930
Do you see these? These products are for you to take.

580
00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.110
All right, then. Beat Jang Hari.

581
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:34.890
Let's begin!

582
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.760
Fighting!

583
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:38.580
Fighting!

584
00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.010
All right, first question.

585
00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.950
Picture, please.

586
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:46.450
- What brand is this baby bottle from? 
 - Me! Me!

587
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:48.640
- What do you mean, me?! 
 - The mom! The mom!

588
00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.340
Momma, Momma, Fat Baby Bottle.

589
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.090
Please give her a prize

590
00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:57.400
Congrats!

591
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.360
Congrats!

592
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.280
The next question is a song quiz!

593
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:06.360
Listen to the song, and give us the song title. Please give us the song.

594
00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.090
<i>Mom! I—</i>

595
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:09.040
Jang Hari! Pororo!

596
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.630
Pororo, which one?

597
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.080
Which one?

598
00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.760
The mom. The second one.

599
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.960
Correct!

600
00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.290
Congrats!

601
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:25.560
Next "The Mom," please come out.

602
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.270
There are two similar porridges in front of you.

603
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.830
Please guess which one is candle wax, and which one is porridge.

604
00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:34.100
- Jang Hari! Wax and porridge. 
 - Correct!

605
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:45.430
How old is this child?

606
00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:47.780
Jang Hari! 12 months.

607
00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:50.820
12 months! Correct! Okay!

608
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.900
Over here!

609
00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.570
It's hard, right? You're almost done.

610
00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.630
My goodness! So pretty, my daughter.

611
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:06.990
Do you want to see Aunt Hari?

612
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:10.620
Dad wants to see her, too.

613
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:20.010
Aunt Hari must be coming.

614
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.230
What brings you here?

615
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:38.480
Oh, I'm Yoon Doha's mother.

616
00:49:49.730 --> 00:49:52.130
Good job.

617
00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.030
Are you going to become a soccer player?

618
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:56.600
Mom, you should join in.

619
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:09.170
All right, I'll take a family picture.

620
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.200
Did Hari tell you?

621
00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:16.040
There was a call at the hospital. They just told me the address, nothing else.

622
00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:20.390
Just take this picture. I don't want Doha to get hurt.

623
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.190
Just a second.

624
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:32.120
All right, I'll take the picture.

625
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.340
One, two, three!

626
00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.530
Did you have fun?

627
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:51.530
Having worked here for 15 years, I can guess a child's age in months by simply looking at a picture.

628
00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:59.230
The reason for me, who has no experience in parenting, giving you guys a challenge is because

629
00:50:59.230 --> 00:51:05.930
we wanted to show you our weaknesses, and our strengths.

630
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:12.770
The work that we're doing, is because we wanted to assist in the parenting processes that don't have any perfect answers.

631
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:17.040
Please think of us as a point of reference, and as a friend.

632
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.490
<i> I'm right, right? You're the girl who was going to buy sperm illegally.</i>

633
00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:24.200
<i>How could you do that? Without a conscious?</i>

634
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:32.140
Because of my personal life, you may question

635
00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.810
my right to be a reporter for parenting.

636
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:42.600
From my perspective, because you all got angry as mothers, but also after reading my article,

637
00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.860
understood my desire to become a mother.

638
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:53.780
I've wanted to become a better reporter and a better mom.

639
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.820
I've met a lot of mothers in the last 15 years,

640
00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:04.030
and I've only wanted to become a mother more.

641
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:10.320
I'll learn more, and I'll share more information.

642
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.520
So, please come back.

643
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.580
Please!

644
00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.040
Please!

645
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:38.910
Where is it?

646
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.080
Not it.

647
00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.350
Mom!

648
00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:56.380
Mom!

649
00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:01.180
Eutteum! Eutteum!

650
00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.370
It's me, Eutteum!

651
00:53:02.370 --> 00:53:04.150
Eutteum.

652
00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:09.020
Why are you sneaking around? I thought you were a thief and got scared!

653
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.560
I'm sorry I scared you.

654
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:18.420
Wh-Wh-What did you get hit with? Did you get hit with a watermelon?

655
00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.890
Did I hit your face?

656
00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.590
No! It didn't hurt at all. Are you all right?

657
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:26.510
Ah, seriously.

658
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:29.600
Why do you keep getting abused by me!

659
00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.550
You shouldn't hit someone no matter how much they deserve it.

660
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:37.410
I'm sorry, I'll try to stop deserving to be hit and only do good things. I'm sorry.

661
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.960
Eutteum, I can never understand you.

662
00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:48.020
You only do annoying things, but I can't hate you.

663
00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:56.150
So then, if I only do likeable things, you'll like me. Right?

664
00:53:59.910 --> 00:54:02.580
Senior, can you give me your hand for a second?

665
00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.720
I got my palm read one day...

666
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.760
But your palm...

667
00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:15.360
What? What is that? What is that?!

668
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.600
What are you doing?

669
00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.130
Why is this here?

670
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.420
Yeah, I was just curious.

671
00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.350
You know, those moments when you just want to?

672
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.950
Just wan- just...

673
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:30.240
All of a sudden?

674
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.170
Get rid of this.

675
00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:39.200
This is too big, too.

676
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:44.800
Who on earth are you trying to give it to by testing it on me?

677
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.760
Just a moment, I have a situation so let me just try...

678
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.220
Just a moment...

679
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.310
Are you going to try everything here on me?

680
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:57.330
This is really the last one! I'll just try this and be done.

681
00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:05.530
Wow, amazing!

682
00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:16.120
I really can't understand you.

683
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:26.020
I thought about what if someone else wanted it,

684
00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:30.540
but I couldn't do it. Because it's you

685
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:36.230
that's why I wanted to try it.

686
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:47.490
But... I don't think I can give it to you.

687
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:13.130
The door's open! Come in.

688
00:56:18.060 --> 00:56:20.610
It was you? I thought it was Eunyoung.

689
00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:25.010
Why are you meddling? Why would you call Jungwon?

690
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.490
I was just thinking about Doha.

691
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.400
Would she look at her baby pictures and think, "Oh, this is when my mom abandoned me?"

692
00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.720
I was afraid she'd think that.

693
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:44.080
Do you really hate her that much?

694
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.640
No. I hate you more.

695
00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.780
Ah, seriously! Why do you always act like a brat?

696
00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:54.970
So immature.

697
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:56.780
Hey, Jang Hari.

698
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.530
What? Huh? Why?

699
00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:05.420
Do you think I'll get scared because you're acting like this?

700
00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:08.910
Do you want me to get back together with Jungwon?

701
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:12.740
That's you guys' problem.

702
00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.270
I don't.

703
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:18.200
I don't want you to date Han Yisang!

704
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:24.420
Why is the door open?

705
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:27.720
What are you guys doing? Are you fighting again?

706
00:57:27.720 --> 00:57:31.190
No, we're not.

707
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.890
Gosh!

708
00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:37.920
Get a grip, guys. Get it together.

709
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.600
Why are you guys fighting again?

710
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:49.930
I just got mad, all right? Just let it go.

711
00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:54.630
All right, all right. It's all my fault.

712
00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:01.720
I caught my brother-in-law cheating and sent a picture to my sister, right?

713
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:03.930
But she's mad at me.

714
00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.730
Why?

715
00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:08.940
She knew about it this entire time and pretended to not know.

716
00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:14.200
But because of me, she can't pretend anymore so she's throwing a fit.

717
00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.610
My sister can't live without my brother-in-law.

718
00:58:17.610 --> 00:58:20.750
Because of the kids, they can't get a divorce.

719
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:27.610
If you have a kid, even if you divorce, your relationship doesn't end.

720
00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:35.220
I understand you're in a bad mood because you met your ex-wife.

721
00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:38.560
What can I do about being really happy when I'm finally dating after ten years?

722
00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:41.630
Even if you hate seeing it, tolerate it.

723
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:44.820
What excuse do you have not to tolerate it?

724
00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:47.540
I'm proud of you, Jang Hari!

725
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.960
I thought you were going to grow old alone. My goodness, seriously. Hey,

726
00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:55.780
forget about kids, just date! Don't get married!

727
00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:00.040
I wonder what kind of man he is. I want to see him quickly.

728
00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.680
You're going to be shocked when you see him.

729
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.670
Talking about him makes me miss him more.

730
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:07.960
That's enough.

731
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:13.260
Don't get hurt and cry all night. Moderate yourself.

732
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.190
How can you moderate how much you love?

733
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:23.220
Do you measure out your love and only give and take a certain amount?

734
00:59:26.570 --> 00:59:29.790
Why do you think we're going to break up?

735
00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:33.010
You were always like that.

736
00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:37.850
Getting hurt, coming back, getting hurt, coming back.

737
00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.370
You're such a horrible jerk, seriously...

738
01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:05.350
Bye.

739
01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.200
Yoon Jaeyoung!

740
01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:14.500
- Is it your dream to end relations? 
 - What?

741
01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.640
After all this time, how can you look at her that way?

742
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.030
If she finds out you have feelings, Hari won't see you.

743
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.670
What did I do?

744
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:34.350
You're blocking me like this from seeing her. What can I do?

745
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:39.030
It was to that extent?

746
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:45.230
She's so happy that she finally has someone she likes in ten years.

747
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:50.400
She doesn't see you. If you do that, you can't even be her friend.

748
01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:59.770
- Come on!  Come on! 
 - My goodness, how pretty!

749
01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:02.320
Here!

750
01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:04.010
Look.

751
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.790
Despite everything, your mother managed to pick out a good gift.

752
01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.360
It's fascinating, right?

753
01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.420
Really.

754
01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.660
<i>Even if it doesn't end well with that guy, Hari won't go to you.</i>

<i>If you want to keep seeing her, don't get caught and sort out your feelings.</i>

756
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:27.070
Try it again!

757
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:28.170
Look at this.

758
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:30.710
Look at this! Look at this.

Oh?

762
01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:51.980
<i>Hello?</i>

763
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.980
How did you call at the right time? Did you know that I missed you?

764
01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.280
- Did you not know that I missed you? 
 - Oh...

765
01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:04.290
Did you win or "The Mom"?

<i>My head got hit a lot.</i>

767
01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.000
A hole was about to form.

768
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.020
I should go and blow on it.

769
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.830
Where should we go next time?

770
01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:18.430
There's a spicy rice cake shop in front of my house. Do you want to go? It's really delicious.

771
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:49.620
<i>Will you be okay?</i>

772
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.860
It was hard for you mentally at that time.

773
01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:57.140
This time, I think I'll be able to withstand it.

774
01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.650
You have to get the hormone shot twice a week for more than three months.

775
01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:07.980
But since you said it'll be hard to go to the hospital every week, I'll teach you how to insert the shot.

776
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.500
As you know, the results you want may not come out.

777
01:03:14.350 --> 01:03:22.120
If there's no effect after 3 months... 6 months... or even 1 year... I'll do it until it works.

778
01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.020
Did you tell your girlfriend?

779
01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.560
I should have.

787
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.060
I thought it wouldn't come in.

788
01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:38.850
Good job!

789
01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.470
Did you see? "The Mom" has all gathered back.

790
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:46.880
Okay.

791
01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:52.850
I saw the video. Chairman did too and he told me to come on up.

792
01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.630
He didn't say anything?

793
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.990
I would know once I go.

794
01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:01.590
If there's no particular issue, the result will come out.

795
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:12.590
You did well, Chief Editor Jang.

796
01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:18.380
You did it!  Good job!

797
01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.650
Chief Editor Jang!

798
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:26.470
Now... we should clean up and leave. Thank you.

799
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.790
It's because of you guys.

Hello?

Where are you?

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.990
Here.

819
01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:19.630
I feel really good today!

820
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:27.440
Because I feel good, I thought about you all day and missed you even more.

821
01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:34.360
So... I need to say something today.

I love you.

Hari didn't come in.

830
01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:25.960
Did you not hear anything?

831
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.200
Are you worried that Hari is going to live without a child?

832
01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.770
I'm worried she's going to live alone.

833
01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:38.570
Are you okay... for Hari to give birth and raise a baby alone?

834
01:08:38.570 --> 01:08:41.910
What mother wants her daughter to receive hate?

835
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:45.740
It's my wish for her to meet a good man, have a child with him, and live well.

836
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:50.750
Since she can't have a baby, she can at least do that.

837
01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:55.570
Aunt... shall I bring her to live with me?

838
01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.490
You?

839
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:05.350
Well, I... I can just be by her side like now.

840
01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.990
Until now... I've done that.
