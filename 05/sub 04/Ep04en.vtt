[Backstreet Rookie]

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.980
I don't want your phone.
I want your money. Give me money.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.560
Hey, I don't care what you're doing,
but take it outside.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.430
You can't just hog the bathroom like this.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.100
Where do you think you're going?

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.770
Did... Did you do that to my friends?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.200
Why? Do you need a beating as well?

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.870
Go ahead and try if you can.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.110
Where are you going? Just stay inside.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.880
Stay right there. Everything will be fine.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.550
You'll get hurt, so stay inside.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.790
I guess you're here with a big group.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.820
Can't you see that I'm here by myself?
You must be pretty intimidated.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.020
No, I'm not.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.790
Oh, hello.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.200
You little... What just happened?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.300
You're safe now. You can come out.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.140
You can come out now. It's safe.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.940
Why are you doing this to me?

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.610
Why do you think?
I really need to go to the bathroom.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320
Get out already!

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.150
My goodness, I need to go!

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.420
You're so stubborn. Come out already!

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.560
-Come out now.
-I'm fine.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.030
-Gosh, please get out.
-Yeon-joo!

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.200
Stop it!
Yeon-joo, are you okay? What happened?

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.300
-What happened?
-I don't know.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.770
-Gosh, what was that?
-Are you okay? What happened?

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.700
Mr. Choi?

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.340
Jung Saet-byul?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.009
Who?

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.080
She's the part-timer at my store.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.580
She's the part-timer?

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.310
Yeon-joo?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.020
What happened?
What are you two doing here?

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.090
What are you doing here, then?
This is a women's bathroom.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.760
Yeon-joo, are you okay?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.900
Do I look okay to you?

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.370
Saet-byul, what are you doing here?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.970
-Sorry?
-Why are you beating people up?

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.880
No, it's not what it looks like.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.210
Then what is it? What happened?
Did Yeon-joo do it?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.150
No.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.650
Excuse me.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.350
Tell him that I saved you.
I wasn't bullying you.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.320
How would I know that?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.230
I saved you from getting beaten up!

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.560
Jung Saet-byul! Are you threatening her?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.470
-Mr. Choi, why don't you listen--
-Whatever.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.840
You told me that you have a family thing
and you're fighting at a bar?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.040
Is this all that you are?

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.980
I'm so disappointed in you.
Yeon-joo, let's get out of here.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.410
We'll talk about this later.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.350
Are you okay?

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.520
Darn it.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.720
Isn't that Saet-byul's boss?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.300
You're right, it's the stingy boss.
She must be his girlfriend.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.970
What kind of a convenience store
has an owner and a part-timer

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.840
who don't even watch the store?

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.340
Do you think Saet-byul saw them?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.980
I feel so much better.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.380
Isn't this bar so mediocre?

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.120
-Totally.
-I know a better one. Let's go.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.320
Okay? Thank you. Let's go!

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.020
Bring my purse for me.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.420
-Let's go.
-Darn it.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.329
[What was that?]

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.100
[It was definitely someone else.]

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.370
Jung Saet-byul?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.910
What are you doing here, then?
This is a women's bathroom.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.340
[I don't like her eyes, either.]

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.220
-What's the deal with that part-timer?
-What?

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.220
I don't like the way she looks at you.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.420
It's nothing. She was just surprised
to see me there.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.860
So, what are you going to do?

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.090
-About what?
-"About what"?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.590
Do you know how terrified I was?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.200
She fights better than a man!

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.970
She's a strong one, indeed.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.700
How can you hire someone so lowly?

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.470
You told me to be nice to her.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.440
That's before I found out
what kind of a person she is!

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.640
Are you going to keep her there?

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.950
Remember when I had
a little misunderstanding with her?

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.920
I promised her that I'll let her
continue to work at the store.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.590
Is keeping that promise that important?

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.159
Even after watching what happened to me
back there?

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.890
Can you imagine what would've happened
if you didn't come for me?

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.900
Should I have gotten hurt back there?
Would you have taken care of it, then?

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.230
Why would you bring me to such a place
and let this happen to me?

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.600
Yeon-joo, I'm sorry.
I'm the one who did wrong.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.270
I was hoping that we'd be able
to reminisce our old days there.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.570
Sorry that I made you make
a bad memory of the place

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.280
when I only wanted to reminisce
the good days.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.710
Exactly. We could've just passed by.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.450
Why did we have to drink there?

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.920
As a business owner,
I know how bad it feels

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.350
to have a customer come in
and just leave after.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.420
Come on. You only think about others.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.930
Don't let this go like the last time.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.460
I'm serious.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.930
Yeon-joo.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.240
My goodness.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.350
Some girls were trying to steal money
from that woman,

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.680
so I beat them all up.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.550
So, Mr. Choi's girlfriend was getting
beaten up and looted,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.190
and you saved her but got misunderstood
like an idiot?

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.660
Are you a guru or something?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.130
You're Daily Guru, aren't you?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.130
You idiot, you didn't say anything?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.010
What would this idiot even say?

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.310
I'm fine.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.410
-Let's keep drinking.
-Drink it up.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.050
Welcome.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.950
You're the customer here.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.320
Really?

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.820
He's looking at us!

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.790
-He's looking at your pretty face!
-He is!

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.530
Your beautiful face shines
even in the darkness!

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.900
You're Saet-byul, right? Jung Saet-byul?

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:51.970
Yes, that's me.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.480
Who is this?

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.180
It's me, Kang Ji-wook.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.780
-Goodness!
-No way.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:00.920
Who's that?

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.520
He's Kang Ji-wook the celebrity!

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.550
You said that you know someone
with the same name.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.790
Kang Ji-wook?

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.860
Yes, your father used to train me.
Don't you remember?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.860
Wait, you're Puppy?

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.700
I haven't heard that in so long.
You always used to call me Puppy.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.240
Hey! Puppy!

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.240
-Hey!
-Puppy? Puppy who?

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.409
Look how much my puppy has grown.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.020
-She's touching his face!
-She's touching him!

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.790
My goodness, she's touching him!

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.460
No way. My goodness!

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.560
Look how much you've grown.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.370
You little... What just happened?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.980
[What is she?]

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.120
I'm going to beat someone up
sometime soon, so get ready.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.960
Get ready to fight when I call, okay?

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.320
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.230
Whatever it takes, I'm going to find her.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.230
Let's go.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.530
Hey, kids.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.340
You must clean up after yourself.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.040
We're not kids.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.179
How dare an insect talk to me? Let's go.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.280
Where are your manners?

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.679
I need to smack some sense into you all.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.150
You brats.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:13.110
[Does that mean people don't change?]

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.490
-Yes, Editor?
-Hey, Fire Volcano.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.830
I just finished working on the last cut.
I'll upload it soon.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.430
Okay, thank you.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:36.070
Okay.

-Hey, Dae-hyun.

Why do you look so tired?
How are things these days?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.050
It's going well.

The profit drops
when Saet-byul isn't here.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.330
Of course.

Have a good shift. I'll get going.
I'll come back in the morning.

What is it?

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.450
A couple of nights ago,
the part-timer girl...

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.950
You mean Saet-byul? What about her?

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.250
Nothing.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.420
No, but you should know.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.320
But I can't tell you.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.190
Should I tell him or should I not?

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:30.860
I can't decide.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.360
Dal-sik?

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.960
-I saw the part-timer girl...
-Yes?

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.400
beat people up.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.570
Jung Saet-byul did?

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.140
She completely beat up three men,

that you saw?

She didn't just do double-flying kicks
and slap their faces.

She had them kneel down
and had a whole talk with them.

-Saet-byul had to go home,

his employee like this!

Don't be like that.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.520
Indeed. Imagine how the store
would've been if it weren't for her.

Don't you know how much the sales have
gone up ever since she started working?

She's just a temporary part-timer.
That's unnecessary.

We can increase our sales without her.

because of sales?

-We know.
-That's why we're here.

It was her dad's death anniversary?

And your girlfriend avoided getting
beaten up thanks to Saet-byul.

But instead of thanking her,
you thought she...

The liar here is your girlfriend,
not Saet-byul.

so much on your mind?

That's not true. You can't lie to me.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.470
Is it because of the sales queen?

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.300
Because she works
at his convenience store?

on Mr. Choi's part-timer?

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:16.320

It's been a long time, Mr. Choi.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.600
Yes, it has.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.230

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:35.940
Okay.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.410
I can't wait to hear
what you're going to say.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.980
That day at the bar...

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.260
Everyone else was on the floor.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.160
And you were the only one who was fine.
Why was that?

00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:02.500
You made a surprise visit to ask me that?

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.970
I don't even want to think about it,
so you can make your own judgment.

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:07.900
Yeon-joo.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:11.200
This might not mean much to you.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.170
But to that kid,
her life might depend on it.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:16.680
I think you're overreacting.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.880
All jobs are precious
whether it's an office job at a big firm

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.480
or a part-time job at a convenience store.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:21.810
No one deserves

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.820
to lose their job for an unsure reason.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:33.690
I know I'm just a manager
of a small convenience store.

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.530
But she's the first employee I ever hired,
and I don't want to fire her like this.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:40.830
I want to make a decision
after I check the facts.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.700
The fact is that she used violence.

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:47.940
But she didn't use it on you.
She used it on those girls

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:50.540
who harassed you. Isn't that also correct?

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:54.180
What doesn't change
is that she's a violent person.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:04.990
Yeon-joo.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.360
You know how you said
you never did anything behind my back?

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:10.400
The same goes for me.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.600
Please don't think
that I'm taking someone's side.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.740
You see, I'm just trying

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.110
to stick to our principle
and do what's right.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.510
But no principle is more important to me

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.680
than you, Yeon-joo.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:28.710
You're the most
important principle of all.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.380
So Yeon-joo,

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.350
I'll just do as you say.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.430
Think about it carefully,

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:44.630
and let me know
once you've made up your mind.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:49.340
I should go now.

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.310
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.780
You're just going to leave like that?

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:07.590
Gosh, you make it so hard for me
to hate you.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.430
-You should go now.
-Yeon-joo.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.030
Hey, Mom.

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:23.540
-You should go now.
-Your... Your mother?

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.580
Gosh, what should I do?

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.690
I should go and say hello,
but I'm not dressed properly.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.750
Let's go.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.030
Mother.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:54.000
Hello?

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:56.470
[Hello, are you
the convenience store manager?]

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:57.870
[This is the police station.]

00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.810
The... The police station?

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.310
Stop asking me.

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.540
What kind of person is he?

00:43:03.610 --> 00:43:05.180
-My gosh.
-Come on.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.650
He has common sense, he's conscientious,

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:09.620
and he's also a very trustworthy guy.

00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.680
No, not that. What is his job?

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.350
Why does that matter?

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.190
Did you recently start dating him?

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.020
No, we've been together
for over two years.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.790
What? "Two years"?

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.890
Then why didn't you tell me?

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.600
Because I'm finally confident now.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.530
I'm going to stand my ground
regardless of what you say.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:33.770
Saet-byul, what happened?

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.870
Are you okay?

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:39.140
Why did you come?
You'll only get disappointed again.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.550
Did you get hurt?

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.880
No, I'm okay.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:45.320
-What about the convenience store?
-Dal-sik is there.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.860
My gosh, I think I tore a ligament.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.930
I won't let this slide.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:54.830
-We meet again.
-Yes.

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.260
My gosh, you're very busy.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.270
What happened?

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:02.770
He apparently tried
to encourage her a little,

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.940
but she twisted his arm.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.440
He didn't encourage me.
He kept massaging my hand.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.870
See? Look at her!

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:10.840
You did nothing right!

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.680
You deserve to go to prison.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:22.390
Hello, sir.
Let me apologize on her behalf.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:24.920
-I'm sorry.
-Who are you?

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.390
I'm the manager of the convenience store.

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:30.830
You're the manager?
How did you educate your staff

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.730
for her to be so rude to me?

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.170
You see, I held her hand

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.200
because I thought of her like a daughter.

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:40.840
Then the least she could do
was thank me for it.

00:44:43.310 --> 00:44:44.480
Hey, listen.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:47.350
You sexually harassed her,
but I still apologized.

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:48.780
You should be satisfied with that.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.880
What? "Sexually harass"? You little punk.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.890
I was going to let this slide
because I didn't want to be like you.

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.820
But you know what?

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:00.590
I want you to apologize to my part-timer

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.030
for sexually harassing her.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:13.010
Hey, you punk. This is slander.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.610
You also deserve to go to prison.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.540
Officer, I'd like to sue him for slander.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.410
Let's see if you really did
sexually harass her or not.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.120
-What?
-Take a look.

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.150
[Hello, everyone.

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.360
-I guess that's your hobby.
[-Hello, I'm Choi Dae-hyun!]

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:36.560
This isn't the right video.
No, it's not this.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.330
Here. This is it.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.610
My gosh.

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.910
This is good enough evidence.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:51.980
Should I file a complaint?

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:54.780
No, wait. Excuse me.

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.080
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:01.450
Don't go around telling girls
you think of them like a daughter.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.420
Some people might get heartbroken
after hearing you say that, okay?

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.530
Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize.

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.930
Don't apologize to me!

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.100
Hey.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.970
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.680
Saet-byul, let's go.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.380
Hey, wait. Your cell phone.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:32.120
-Right. I forgot.
-You should take it.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:34.820
That crazy jerk.

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.530
Saet-byul.

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.770
Why did you help me?
I harassed your girlfriend.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.470
Why would you say that?
I know you didn't harass her.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.610
You should've told me
that you were innocent.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:57.780
I tend to learn things very quickly.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:59.810
I learned that it's better
to feel a bit wronged

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.210
rather than to have expectations
and get disappointed.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:03.750
What do you mean?

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.650
I don't have parents,
and I got expelled from school.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:07.820
Everyone thinks I'm lying.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.290
No one ever believes me.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.820
What are you talking about? You have me.

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:13.690
I will believe you.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:22.570
I'm sorry

about what happened that day.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.240
I think Yeon-joo got mistaken
because of the situation she was in.

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.580
She's usually not like that.

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:34.880
I'm jealous of her. She even has someone
who apologizes on her behalf.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.790
You were wrong for what you did today.

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.730
What? What did I do wrong?

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.960
You could've gotten hurt.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.730
He wasn't worth the quarrel.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.900
You should've just
reported him to the cops.

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:55.970
And why did you beat those guys
who stole from our store?

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:58.570
Do you know what would've happened
if they reported you to the cops?

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:02.010
-Why are you so angry at me?
-I'm not angry.

I'm scolding you.

You're scolding me?

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:11.880
Yes, I'm scolding you
because you deserve a scolding.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:15.750
I'm going to be your guardian
while you work part-time at my store.

So if you do anything wrong,
I won't stay still.

I'm going to scold you, okay?

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.860
You should know better
than to fight with people like that.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.600
Are you such a good fighter?

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.600
Then go ahead and hit me.
Let me see how good you are.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.070
Hit me.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.370
-Are you serious?
-Yes, I'm not kidding.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.440
-Hit me.
-Are you sure you won't regret it?

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:39.750
No, I won't. Just don't tickle me.

Where are you going?

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:01.370
She doesn't beat people up for no reason.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:04.100
She only beats up people who deserve it.

to deserve this.]

I would've just ignored you.

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.870
My gosh, should I go there
and encourage her a little?

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.610
Hey, forget it. Don't go there.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.380
Yes, it's best
that she doesn't know about you.

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.110
You shouldn't come.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.580
Why? Do I embarrass you?

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:40.820
-Yes, very.
-Yes, we're very embarrassed of you.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.220
My gosh, come on.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:45.520
Threefold?

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.660
What...

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.600
[Jung Saet-byul, the staff
at Jongno Shinseong branch,]

00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:55.900

-What is it?

00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.940
-This... Look...
-What is it? Let me see.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.370
-What is it?
-I can't see.

00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.610
-What's this?
-Wait a minute.

00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:03.910
-"Best employee". My goodness!
-"Best employee"?

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.040
Saet-byul became the best employee!

00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.550
-The best employee!
-"The best employee"?

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.850
-Nice!
-This is great!

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.590
-I can't believe this!
-Be careful!

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:18.620
-My gosh, this is unbelievable!
-We finally made it!

a happy occasion ♫

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:37.610
Mr. Choi, why is the sign...

00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:42.580
What? You mean this sign?

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.450
[Part-timer Wanted]

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.220
Why did you...

00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:48.990
Because we don't need this anymore.

00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:52.660
You became the best employee
of this month, Saet-byul.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:56.600
That's nonsense.

00:53:56.660 --> 00:53:59.930
Saet-byul, you became
the best employee of the month!

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:06.370

♫ Congratulations ♫

Why aren't you happy?

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:16.550
A job-hunting site is even going to come
and interview you.

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:17.850
What's so great about that?

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.250
We'll just end up getting more customers
and be more tired.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.950
How could you say that?
You're the employee of the month.

00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:24.860
Employee of the month, my foot.

00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:27.290
All I do is make you go
to the police station.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.260
Yes, will you please stop
making me go to the police station?

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:34.100
Oh, right.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:36.600
You told me to come early yesterday
because you had something to say.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:37.870
-What was it about?
-What?

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.580
Oh, well... You were late two days ago.
I wanted to talk to you about that.

00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.010
That's because someone outside
asked me the directions--

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.580
Anyway, you'd better work hard.
Otherwise, I'll demote you to a temp.

00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:53.120
Gosh, you're so narrow-minded.

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:56.490
No wonder my friends call you
Mr. Narrow-minded.

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:59.560
I'm not narrow-minded.
I'm just not generous with everyone.

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:02.290
People who know me know that I'm a man

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.030
with a very generous heart.

00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:08.730
Are you impressed?

00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:13.440
Why did you start
a convenience store business?

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.610
What?

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:19.880
Most of the convenience store owners
are middle-aged men.

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:24.320
I've never seen one
who's as young as you are.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:26.220
I remember you telling me

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.220
that the convenience store
is your life and future.

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.090
And I can't stop thinking about that.

00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:41.070
You want to know why I do this business?

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.170
I guess I should answer since you became
the employee of the month.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.980
Instead, don't tell anyone.
This is a secret.

00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:00.320
I'm sure you already know
that I used to work at the main branch.

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:03.590
I spent my days working really hard.

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.060
But one day,

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:11.200
a spirit showed up in my dreams
and said this.

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:14.670
"Dae-hyun, quit your office job"

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:18.240
"and open up a convenience store."
I was given a message.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.710
So this story almost made it
to the show called "Incredible Moments".

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.710
My gosh, you're such a liar.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.510
Don't try to find out why. It's a secret.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:31.520
It'll make me seem too attractive.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.760
Your confidence is so groundless.

00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:39.520
What are you talking about?
I'm confident for a reason.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:40.560
That's nonsense.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.830
You just don't know.
There are reasons to my confidence.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:47.200
But is this it? You're going to
congratulate me just by tearing the sign?

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:50.100
Yes, that's it.
Now, you need to clean it up.

00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.840
-Throw me up in the air.
-I can't do that alone.

00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:56.470
Then give me a ride on your shoulders.

00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:59.240
No one's ever done that for me before.
You can be the first one to do it.

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:02.010
Didn't I tell you that I have
a herniated cervical disk?

00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.080
My neck is bent forward like this.

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:09.550
How lame. Then at least give me
a piggyback ride.

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:11.320
Forget it. Why would I do that?

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:16.900
Seriously? This is it? This is how you're
going to congratulate the best employee?

00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:20.870
What more do you expect?
I think I've done enough.

00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:22.570
Gosh, forget it.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:25.100
My gosh, what do you expect?

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:26.770
Is this what you want?

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.290
-Is that for me?
-Yes, it's for you.

00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.620
Take it.

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.300
This is my favorite flower.

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:53.360
I was going to buy red roses.

00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:56.000
But the florist told me
the meaning of that flower.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.740
It means admiration,
gratefulness, and faithfulness.

00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.870
I chose that flower
because the meaning suited you.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.840
There's also another meaning.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.410
What's that?

00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.320
[A pink rose symbolizes
a declaration of love.]

00:58:10.350 --> 00:58:12.320
-You don't need to know.
-My gosh.

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:15.550
I'm so happy.

00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.220
Now, you just need to give me
a piggyback ride.

00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:20.690
You still haven't given up on that?

00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:24.400
Of course. I don't give up that easily.
That's how I became the best part-timer

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.100
among millions of part-timers
in this country.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.230
I'm sure you know how hard it is
to become that

00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.600
since you used to work
at the headquarters.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.310
Okay, fine. I'll give you a piggyback ride
just this once for one second.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.680
-Forget it.
-Okay, fine.

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.110
Three seconds. No more negotiating.
Three seconds. Deal?

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:45.220
Come here.

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:48.520
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

00:58:49.090 --> 00:58:51.290
Wait. Let me get my knees ready.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:52.890
Okay, come on.

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.690
-Are you ready?
-Yes. In 1, 2, 3.

00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:00.170
Okay. Now, 1, 2, 3. Get off.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:04.070
-Hurry up and get off.
-Try and make me.

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:06.440
Are you kidding me? Hey, get off me.

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:09.640
Hey, you'll get hurt if I use my strength.

00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:11.940
-Get off me.
-No!

00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:13.880
Gosh, will you please get off me?

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:17.780
Yeon...
