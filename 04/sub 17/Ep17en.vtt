32
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.760
It's so late,

33
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.320
why isn't Adviser back to report on the refugees?

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.530
If things were normal, she would definitely be back by now.

35
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.650
But now...

36
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.490
The county office's back yard is not a comfortable place.

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.450
Your Miss Jiang is tidying up as if it's her own home.

38
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.940
She even cleaned Adviser Tan’s study extremely thoroughly.

39
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.970
If it were me, I wouldn't come either.

40
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.350
I never imagined that you, the omnipotent and self-important Sir Tang,

41
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.740
would end up like this.

42
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.010
How does it feel to be ruined because of a woman?

43
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.600
Who's ruined because of a woman?

44
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.880
You're a winner! Your beloved has never looked you in the eyes.

45
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.560
Are... Are all women on earth the same?

46
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.320
I picked my beloved from tens of thousands.

47
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.530
It might be a challenge but there will be bitterness before the sweetness comes.

48
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.820
You picked yours from tens of thousands, but is my Adviser inferior?

49
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.300
Your Adviser has such an explosive disposition. I wouldn't want her even if she were gifted to me.

50
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.490
Hey, where are you going?

51
00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.380
I'm bloated from all the food. I'm going for a walk.

52
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.010
Sit down and stop looking for excuses.

53
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.430
Going for a walk? You're going to be out all night.

54
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.260
Then first thing tomorrow morning, you'll be squatting in front of Gutang Bookstore.

55
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.630
That's right. You have more experience than me with this.

56
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.430
Can you not talk about me? Let's have a drinking competition.

57
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.450
Who wants to compete with you? I don't drink.

<i>[Phoenix Village]</i>

59
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.730
No way you're my husband!

60
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.520
Why did you hit a girl?

61
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.200
You hit me first.

62
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.230
An eye for an eye is how I live my life.

63
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.690
No matter if they're man or woman.

64
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.050
You are not chivalrous.

65
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.490
You don't look like a man at all.

66
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.060
Whether or not I am a man... Why don't you give it a try?

67
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.490
You wish!

68
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.750
I already have someone I like. I won't marry you.

69
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.750
Idiot girl!

70
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.050
You had better figure out your current situation.

71
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.260
If you don’t marry me, I can kill you at any time.

72
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.870
I am a bandit, not your father.

73
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.070
B-B-Bandits can also understand reason, right?

74
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.920
There are so many women in the world.

75
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.390
You don't need to insist on having me. How about this?

76
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.120
Let me go and I will find you an even more beautiful woman.

77
00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.650
I won't.

78
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.590
I fell in love with you at first sight and it is meant to be. I won't trade.

79
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.360
I even pulled off your clothes when I first met you.

80
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.820
I'm not respectable so I'm not a match for you.

81
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.480
That's right.

82
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.590
You pulled off my clothes when you first met me.

83
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.940
You are the first girl to do that. You should take responsibility for your actions.

84
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.890
Th-There are a lot of ways to be responsible.

85
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.830
For example, if you want compensation for emotional damage, I can give you money.

86
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.550
What does money have to do with this?

87
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.310
I can get money by leaving the mountain and doing some random plundering.

88
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.890
No matter if you agree or not,

89
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.740
we'll conduct the wedding ceremony tomorrow night at this time. There's no room for discussion.

90
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.540
Where are you going?

91
00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.700
Washing up and sleeping.

92
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.350
Be good and stay there.

93
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.370
Stay there.

94
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.680
- Sir— 
 - Shh!

95
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.210
He's asleep.

96
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.800
Head Constable Zheng, Sir Tang asked us to investigate Old Tie.

97
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.920
- In the last few days, there has been a new clue. 
 - That's right.

98
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.750
Rumors are that in the last few days, near the county office,

99
00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.630
someone saw a suspicious man appear.

100
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.870
According to the description, his figure and appearance

101
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.070
are quite similar to Old Tie.

102
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.700
Then, what was he doing at the county office?

103
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.220
If he wanted to plead his case, he could come during the day.

104
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.740
Maybe he's worried.

105
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.910
Or maybe he wasn't here to plead his case.

106
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:03.740
Old Tie worked for their family for two generations.

107
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.560
But exactly two months ago,

108
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.270
there is no record of Old Tie's

109
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.660
clothing, food, housing, and transport in the accounts.

110
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.130
This means that before Sang Jie died, Old Tie

111
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.010
had already left the Sang Manor.

112
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.550
So only one person, Old Tie,

113
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.160
knows where the gold is.

114
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.960
So, Old Tie's appearance

115
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.340
is merely to make secret inquiries at the county office to

116
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.030
find out whether or not we know

117
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.920
the exact location of the hidden gold.

118
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.560
Tomorrow, all of you should

119
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.070
go together to the pawnshop to find Shopkeeper Wen and tell him

120
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.800
that all the impure gold on the market

121
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.420
should be collected.

122
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.820
We will exchange it with government money at a conversion rate of one to one.

123
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.880
There is only one condition and that is that

124
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.610
every person who comes to exchange must be recorded.

125
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.940
What are you doing? It's just us.

126
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.810
Why are you so covered up?

127
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.340
It's all because of you. Do you know who she is?

128
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.180
A woman.

129
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.620
That is the adviser of the Tongling County Office.

130
00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.820
That's even better.

131
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.640
With a government official linking with bandits, our Phoenix Village

132
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.610
is about to start prospering!

133
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.870
Is now the time to make trouble?

134
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.790
Tang Feilong is currently investigating the gold mine.

135
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.960
Now you have kidnapped his adviser.

136
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.330
It's not a big deal if he brings troops to destroy Phoenix Village. However, if he finds out that those are our people,

137
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.910
we are all doomed!

138
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.540
You are making it sound so scary.

139
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.550
How many soldiers does Tongling have? Why would we be scared of them?

140
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.400
Look at you... We escaped death together and should be of one heart.

141
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.400
You are constantly thinking about splitting the gold.

142
00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.610
When we first came to Phoenix Village, we agreed to help each other for better or worse.

143
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.260
Are you regretting it now?

144
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.650
If you get yourself in hot water

145
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.320
because of this woman,

146
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.240
our brothers will all be doomed with you.

147
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.220
Tomorrow's my wedding day.

148
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.770
Don't forget to come for some wedding wine. I'm off.

<i>[Miaosheng Restaurant]</i>

151
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.020
Why have you come?

152
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.210
You shouldn't do things that would reveal your identity, except as a last resort.

153
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.710
There's a matter I have to tell you right now.

154
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.840
Notify your adoptive father immediately so he can make preparations.

155
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:41.800
Tell me.

156
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.370
Tang Feilong is actually Tang Tianyuan.

157
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.650
What we should do now is

158
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.280
to ask your adoptive father to plan ahead.

159
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.060
We also have to make preparations for every eventuality.

160
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.290
Qingchen, why are you here?

161
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.970
My sister didn't return home last night. We searched all night but couldn't find her.

162
00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.180
Sir, please help us find her.

163
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.470
She's not at Miaosheng Restaurant?

164
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.270
Dawang! Xiaoliu!

165
00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.340
Gather all our men and find her!

166
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.800
- Adviser! Adviser! 
 - Adviser! Adviser!

167
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.270
- Adviser! Adviser! 
 - Adviser! Adviser!

168
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.000
<i>- Adviser! Adviser! 
 - Adviser! Adviser!</i>

169
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.870
<i>Adviser, can you hear me?</i>

170
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.670
<i>- Adviser! 
 - Adviser!</i>

171
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.530
<i>- Adviser! 
 - Adviser!</i>

172
00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.500
Sir.

173
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:49.540
<i>- Adviser! 
 - Adviser!</i>

174
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.570
- This is Adviser's shoe. 
 - Yes.

175
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.290
In front is Phoenix Mountain. Wild beasts can often appear in this area. Adviser Tan—

176
00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:00.570
Nothing bad will happen.

177
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.470
Right, right. Maybe she dropped this shoe when she was running.

178
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.400
She ran away... She ran away...

179
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.160
Is someone keeping watch at the county office?

180
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.140
The assistant is there.

181
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.530
Where did you find this?

182
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.510
Just over there, beside the mud pit.

183
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.990
<i>- Adviser! 
 - Adviser!</i>

184
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.310
<i>- Adviser! Adviser! 
 - Adviser! Adviser!</i>

185
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.210
<i>[Miaosheng Restaurant]</i>

186
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.700
Boss, give me half a kilogram of roast meat and a bottle of good wine.

187
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.460
We're not open today. Go somewhere else to eat!

188
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.280
What kind of attitude is this! Why bother opening a restaurant then?

189
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.550
Er Tong! I asked you to put up a notice, you're slacking off again!

190
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.520
I didn't. I didn't.

191
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:54.600
Boss, I just went to help you print out the missing person notice.

192
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.760
I only just got them printed.

193
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.800
Ask all the staff in the restaurant to go out and paste the notices.

194
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:05.330
Anyone who finds a lead will be heavily rewarded.

195
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:09.110
But Boss, are you sure that it we find her, 
 <i>[Missing person notice]</i>

196
00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.710
we will reward them with a thousand taels?

197
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.790
Our restaurant doesn't have that much money!

198
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.520
Is this your business? Go!

199
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.990
Hey, come with me! Let's go and paste these notices.

200
00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:22.050
Hurry up!

201
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.850
This time, I must save my wife

202
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.560
even if I have to sell this restaurant.

203
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.450
I can't let Tang Feilong be ahead of me.

204
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.830
Assistant Zhou.

205
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:41.780
Have they found Adviser Tan yet?

206
00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.060
We found her shoe at the bottom of Phoenix Mountain.

207
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.760
Phoenix Mountain? Isn't that where bandits gather?

208
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.800
Did bandits kidnap Adviser Tan?

209
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:55.830
That's possible. But Adviser Tan has no grudges with the bandits.

210
00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.290
If the bandits kidnap her, won't they be making enemies with the county office and cause more trouble for themselves?

211
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.500
I'm going to ask some watchmen

212
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.960
if they have any news about Adviser Tan.

213
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.570
Adviser Tan is a good person who will be protected by the heavens. Nothing bad will happen to her.

214
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.690
Oh right!  This is for you.

215
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.300
- This is...? 
 - Take it.

216
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.880
This... Even though I'm poor, I won't be corrupted!

217
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.540
I can't accept this.

218
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.160
Take it. This isn't for you, it's for your younger sister.

219
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.460
This is a few months of my salary and bonuses.

220
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.280
I have been so busy recently so I really don't have time to visit Miss Ruyi.

221
00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.670
Pass it on to her and tell her not to worry.

222
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:33.990
Tell her I've been saving money. I'll be able to give her freedom back soon.

223
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.820
I'm going to find Adviser Tan now. Help me pass this to her,

224
00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.660
Cousin!

225
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.450
<i>[Zhongyi Hall]</i>

226
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.640
Boss!

227
00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.040
So pretty.

228
00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.840
Boss, am I pretty?

229
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.220
Pretty.

230
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.870
Did your other eye go blind, too?

231
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.410
I asked you to buy a wedding dress. If you stole one that's fine,

232
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.010
but you had to steal one from a widow?

233
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.360
- Are you cursing me? 
 - No, no!

234
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.610
Do you want to become the King of the Mountain?

235
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.500
Boss, don't hit me anymore.

236
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.050
I'm only getting married once in this lifetime.

237
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.070
Get yourself down the mountain now and buy the most expensive one!

238
00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.390
Money.

239
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.150
Off with you!

240
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.020
I know I'm as beautiful as a flower but you don't have to look at me like that.

241
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.570
Eat breakfast.

242
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.260
Are you not afraid at all?

243
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:32.170
I am. Will you release me if I'm afraid?

244
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.030
- I can't. 
 - There then.

245
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.160
Eat more. If you're full,

246
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.600
you'll have the energy to get married tonight.

247
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.920
The thing on your neck is a mark of a refugee, right?

248
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.930
You are worthy of being my wife. You're impressive!

249
00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:02.830
Previously you helped Sang Jie privately mine gold.

250
00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:06.750
Afterward, they wanted to kill you, but you escaped.

251
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:10.240
You also know this?

252
00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.370
We were from the same village that was destroyed by disaster, so we came to Tongling.

253
00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.680
Who expected that old man Sang Jie

254
00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:21.170
would want to silence us after getting the gold.

255
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.560
I saw that the situation was bad so I brought a group of our brothers to run away.

256
00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:33.050
I had no idea you had such a background.

257
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.720
But what does it have to do with me?

258
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.390
Anyway, I am about to gain a huge merit.

259
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.570
Don't you have a single shred of sympathy?

260
00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.910
Why should I have sympathy?

261
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.440
You willingly became a bandit and then kidnapped me here to be your wife.

262
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.740
Why should I sympathize with you?

263
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:58.890
I just like how cool and emotionless you look when you're acting like a badass.

264
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.940
Don't worry. I won't marry you even if I have to die. Why don't you try?

265
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:09.860
Then go and die. After you die,

266
00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:14.190
I'll set up a monument for you so when we can meet and enjoy pleasures together in the afterlife.

267
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:15.930
You are truly shameless!

268
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:20.660
I'm a bandit after all. You should enjoy your food

269
00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:24.220
and I'll go see if your wedding dress is ready.

270
00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:43.590
What are you doing?

271
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.130
Do you want to run?

272
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:52.670
- Who are you? 
 - Don't worry about who I am. I'm here to save you.

273
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.890
Why should I believe you?

274
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:03.710
You're the county office adviser, and we are bandits.

275
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:08.570
Duan Feng was seduced by your beauty and kidnapped you. He's essentially making enemies with the authorities!

276
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.700
I definitely won't let him put our brothers into danger.

277
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.420
You sound so sincere, but do you have ways to tackle the people outside.

278
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.860
Isn't this too rash?

279
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:27.380
- If you don't want to leave, then forget it. 
 - I'm going. I'll change.

280
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:31.000
- Brothers, work faster! 
 <i>- Yes!</i>

281
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.480
- Tonight we will drink good wine and eat meat! 
 <i>- Yes!</i>

282
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.650
Where are you going on my wedding day?

283
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:49.040
How can we not have good wine on your big day?

284
00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.500
Wait for me, I'll bring you a few jugs.

285
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.230
- I'll have to trouble you then! 
 - Wait for me to return!

286
00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.940
Zhongyi Hall... sounds joyous.

287
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.910
I've finally escaped!

288
00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.390
Finally escaped!

289
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.190
Thank the heavens and the earth.

290
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.930
Uncle, you're really kind.

291
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.300
It's a pity if you continue being a bandit for the rest of your life.

292
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.060
Just wait a bit more. Once our Sir Tang solves the gold case,

293
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.620
you will have a great future!

294
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.200
What's your name?

295
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.190
My name is crude. Others call me...

296
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.500
Old Tie.

297
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.620
Old Tie.

298
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.670
You're the Sang family's housekeeper, Old Tie?

299
00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:02.260
That's right!

300
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:09.350
Did you think I would release someone who knows all the secrets?

301
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:11.640
Duan Feng insists on creating trouble for himself,

302
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.220
so I can only remove the trouble by its roots!

303
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.390
Put the sword down!

304
00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.140
I knew you weren't an honest person.

305
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:23.910
I finally managed to escape from death. You better not endanger me again!

306
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:25.940
You're just scared I'll keep all your gold.

307
00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.260
It was mine to begin with.

308
00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.170
Stop your nonsense. You won't be getting my share.

309
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.530
Move aside!

310
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.160
Sir!

311
00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.380
Was that Adviser calling me?

312
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.110
No.

313
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.410
- Where did Adviser Tan go? 
 - No idea.

314
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.700
Sir.

315
00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.930
Any clues yet?

316
00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.830
I've asked all the watchmen on shift last night. No one's seen Adviser Tan.

317
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.610
Cong Shun told me he saw bandits from the mountain

318
00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.730
coming to buy wedding supplies.

319
00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:46.770
The seller refused to take their money.

320
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.740
But the bandits didn't steal or make a fuss and paid for everything properly.

321
00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.040
I think Adviser Tan really did get

322
00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.670
kidnapped by bandits.

323
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:54.910
Have the emperor's reinforcements arrived?

324
00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:56.550
Not yet.

325
00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.740
Gather all the soldiers and horses in the county. Head to the mountain immediately.

326
00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.520
Don't be anxious.

327
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.270
Phoenix Village is in the deepest part of Phoenix Mountain.

328
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.440
Not only is the terrain dangerous, but we also don't know how many people they have.

329
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.240
With just a few flawed officers like us...

330
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.950
You might not want to live, but they do!

331
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.940
I can't wait anymore.

332
00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:17.980
Every second we wait puts her in more danger.

333
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.640
Just wait a little!

334
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.460
Perhaps the emperor's reinforcements will soon arrive.

335
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.670
How about this? I'll go to Phoenix Mountain to look around first.

336
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.470
I'll ask the hunters there if they know where Phoenix Village is.

337
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.470
Calm down. Don't be anxious.

338
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.060
Come with me!

339
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.750
Go!

340
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.240
I know how to walk! 
 <i>[Loyalty and virtue]</i>

341
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.350
Let go!

342
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.380
Duan Feng!

343
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.750
Can you be more gentle with me?

344
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.480
Oh?

345
00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:04.000
You do know your husband's name. Not bad.

346
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.870
Were you born in the year of the dog?

347
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.390
Let me tell you!  If you dare to marry me,

348
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.050
I'll poison you day and night. I'll make sure you're completely dead.

349
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.780
You're threatening me?

350
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.080
I'm a bandit. Nothing scares me. Try leaving.

351
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.780
I'll leave!

352
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.960
Run? I'll punish you on the spot, do you believe me?

353
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.690
Hey!

354
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.210
I was just joking. If you have something to say, say it properly.

355
00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.870
Stay here obediently.

356
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.080
Boss, there are officers from the county office hiding in the area.

357
00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.060
Did they see you?

358
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.810
They're more blind than I am. They didn't see.

359
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:52.100
The wedding garment I was carrying was too obvious so I left it behind.

360
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.600
Whatever. We'll just use the one from the widow.

361
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.510
Look after her.

362
00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.880
Try leaving!

363
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.830
Boss,

364
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.880
we've been searching day and night.

365
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.350
What are we looking for? What are we doing?

366
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.480
The informant said that my wife's shoe was found here.

367
00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.130
Also, on the way here,

368
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:35.020
you saw Tang Feilong's people have started searching the mountains.

369
00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:37.260
This means my wife is definitely here!

370
00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.630
But Phoenix Mountain is so big, how will we find her?

371
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:44.250
You're stumped, right?

372
00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.410
This is a dowsing rod. My father gave it to me before I left.

373
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.470
This dowsing rod will definitely lead me to my wife.

374
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:57.960
This time, we have to be the hero who saves the beauty and get there before Tang Feilong. Recite with me.

375
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.020
One must pass the obstacles to seek the dragon;

376
00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.880
Each obstacle is another challenge;

377
00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.330
Every obstacle is guarded by many dangers;

378
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:11.150
Obstacles are made of a mystic array. Lead the way!

379
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.560
A god who's here to guide us!

380
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.760
Excuse me,

381
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.690
brother, where's the path?

382
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:26.830
The path? Where you're standing.

383
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.840
You piece of trash!

384
00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.920
I can't see very well.

385
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.420
They're acting so suspiciously. They don't look like bandits at all.

386
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.810
Are you stupid? We are the bandits.

387
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.530
What do we do?

388
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.040
Bring them.

389
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.180
<i> This powder is colorless and scentless. </i>

390
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.820
<i> Just sprinkle it on the bedroom furniture.</i>

391
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:32.280
<i> Within three days the person‘s body will fester and die.</i>

392
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.030
<i> No one would know.</i>

393
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.660
Assistant Zhou, what are you doing?

394
00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:47.580
Sir Tang has specifically said that no one can come into his room.

395
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:50.850
Can I ask what your business is?

396
00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.740
The county office has some matters to take care of.

397
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.160
I'm here to find him.

398
00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.430
You are... Minister Jiang's daughter?

399
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:03.960
I am. I heard you liked to eat sweets.

400
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:07.730
What a coincidence! I recently acquired some specialties of Chizhou: walnut cookies.

401
00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.880
I want to gift them to you, in case you feel homesick.

402
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.610
Thank you.

403
00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.890
If there's nothing else, I'll head out.

404
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.670
The Phoenix Mountain hunters gave me a map of the mountain.

405
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.560
But it doesn't show where Phoenix Village is.

406
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.320
I heard the people at Phoenix Village are very sly.

407
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.030
They used the terrain to hide the village.

408
00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.750
Apparently no one has come out of there alive.

409
00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:54.240
All of the escaped miners must be hiding there.

410
00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.340
Previously, Lingyin said that she met a refugee with a tattoo.

411
00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:02.480
I'm afraid they'll kill her once they find out her identity.

412
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:07.610
No, no, no. Cong Shun told me the bandits were buying wedding supplies in town.

413
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.210
I don't think they'll think too much.

414
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.780
They just want her to be the bandit leader's wife.

415
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.830
The bandit leader's wife?

416
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.800
Hurry up and go to Chizhou right now! Find Zong Yinglin and ask for 500 soldiers!

417
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.260
Are we using your identity as the county magistrate to borrow them?

418
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.300
Borrow them using my imperial envoy identity. He'll have no choice but to comply!

419
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:27.140
We can't! You can't reveal your identity.

420
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.590
All our efforts will be wasted.

421
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.690
Also, we can't let His Majesty down.

422
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.280
We also can't disappoint the citizens.

423
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:42.020
We must save Adviser Tan but there's got to be another way.

424
00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.860
How many soldiers can we deploy from the county?

425
00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.020
Including me... 25 people.

426
00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.880
Since they are using the terrain to hide,

427
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.470
then we will use the terrain

428
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.400
as an advantage to us.

429
00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.470
<i> [Phoenix Village]</i>

430
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.450
Er Tong!

431
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:09.660
Where are we?

432
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:12.680
I don't know!

433
00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:14.060
Wait.

434
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.030
Who are are you?

435
00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.210
Yeah. Who are you?

436
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.660
Come here! Hang these two up and drop them into a pot of oil.

437
00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.200
- Yes! 
 - Wait,

438
00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.980
we can talk nicely.

439
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:36.020
I... I'm Zhu Dacong. My father is Jinan's magistrate.

440
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:39.470
If you kill me, my father will kill you in return.

441
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.500
Why don't you try?

442
00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.880
- Jinan's Magistrate? 
 - Yes, yes, yes.

443
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.200
That's very impressive.

444
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.910
Where is Jinan again?

445
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.750
1500 kilometers away from Tongling.

446
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:55.520
- 1500km! 
 -1500km!

447
00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.180
By the time your father arrives, you'll be a pile of bones.

448
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.000
I... I...

449
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.600
You... You are actually a bandit?

450
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.630
- That's right! 
 <i>- We are bandits!</i>

451
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:12.750
I am a bandit.

452
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:17.170
You didn't even realize you entered a thieves' den. Are you stupid?

453
00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.330
I'm here to look for my wife.

454
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:23.250
Wife? Is it you?

455
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:31.560
Falling into your hands is God bullying me to the extreme!

456
00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.070
Let me tell you, you bandit head.

457
00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:41.390
- When I go to hell and see the King of Hell, I'll complain about you! I'll bite you to death! 
 - Wait!

458
00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:46.620
Don't tell me your wife is Tongling's Adviser Tan.

459
00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.320
That's right. You're scared, right? She's an adviser.

460
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.370
Screw you!

461
00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.740
Come! We aren't putting him in oil anymore. Mince him up

462
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.420
to make flower paste for my wife!

463
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.560
- Hey! 
 <i>- Mince him, mince him!</i>

464
00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:06.790
Come! I'm commiting suicide!

465
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.610
Come!

466
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.590
Where are you going?

467
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:13.490
Don't treat me like this!

468
00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.730
I, Tan Lingyin, am a strong woman.

469
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.460
I would rather die with honor than live dishonorably.

470
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.600
Today... Today, I will fight you to the death.

471
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.340
Will you still not let me go?

472
00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.590
To this strong woman...

473
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:37.850
your wound is no bigger than a fingernail.

474
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:40.010
If you want to fake a death you need to do better.

475
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:43.350
How about I help you?

476
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:46.840
There's no need. There's no need.

477
00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.540
Why don't you... you have any sympathy?

478
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:57.690
You're cold, I'm ruthless. We're a match made in Heaven.

479
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.580
Let's discuss something.

480
00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.480
Stop playing these tricks on me. You can't run away.

481
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:08.850
I know. You see... Isn't it bad to see blood on the day of our wedding?

482
00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:13.100
Why don't we change the date? Next year... There's definitely an auspicious date next year.

483
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:17.010
As bandits, you care about that kind of stuff, right?

484
00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:18.270
Do you think I'm an idiot?

485
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:22.040
If next year doesn't work... What about next month? There's probably an auspicious date next month, too.

486
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.860
- If next month doesn't work— 
 - Stop this nonsense!

487
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.180
I'm determined to marry you tonight.

488
00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.200
I'm telling you!

489
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.890
<i>My body belongs solely to my wife!</i>

490
00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.030
Look at me.

491
00:31:35.030 --> 00:31:36.720
I'm still a virgin.

492
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.750
I must give my first time to my wife!

493
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:45.120
A virgin? A virgin?

494
00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.330
<i>- What are you doing? Don't push me! 
 - Virgin!</i>

495
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:50.620
What's that noise?

496
00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.920
Your lover is here. But don't worry. I'll turn him into flower paste later.

497
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.470
You have such bad taste. Why would you like someone like him?

498
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.440
Sir!

499
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.960
Zhu Dacong?

500
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:10.070
Zhu Dacong!

501
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:13.250
Wife! Wife!

502
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:15.610
- Why are you here? 
 - I finally found you.

503
00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:17.250
Why did you come?

504
00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:21.380
I came looking for you but then I met this bandit.

505
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.400
But I'm fine. Are you hurt?

506
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.220
I'm fine.

507
00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.000
Let him go. He's not my lover.

508
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.410
Then, why does he call you wife?

509
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:33.180
I only have one lover but many people see me as their beloved. Got it?

510
00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.900
Let him go.

511
00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:37.460
That actually works out well.

512
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.970
I was actually worried that no one would attend the ceremony.

513
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:43.460
What does that mean? What do you plan on doing?

514
00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:46.560
Idiot, tonight,

515
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:48.110
I'm going to marry your wife!

516
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.450
Keep dreaming!

517
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.870
- You are a toad that wants to eat swan meat! 
 - That's right.

518
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.870
How dare you, you damned bandit!

519
00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.400
Once we've done the deal, I'll see what you have left to say.

520
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.300
Okay, okay, okay. Zhu Dacong,

521
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.320
look at what our situation is. Can't you grow some brains?

522
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.700
Will aggravating him help you?

523
00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.890
And you! He's not that smart, so why are you being petty with him?

524
00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:13.920
Let him go. He's my friend.

525
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:17.040
If you touch even a hair on his head, I won't marry you today.

526
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.070
You've agreed to marry me?

527
00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.080
I have no choice.

528
00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:25.130
Get some medicine for me to clean my wound.

529
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.730
Don't forget you have to buy it according to my instructions.

530
00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:32.140
- I'll go right away! 
 - Go!

531
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.200
Wife,

532
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:41.790
you can't give in.

533
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.300
I'm not that dumb.

534
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.690
There's a ceiling above us, so let's duck our heads for now. 
 <i>(T/N: yield and seek opportunity later)</i>

535
00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.460
Stop playing around. Get ready to drink at my wedding toast.

536
00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.790
Loosen the ropes already!

537
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.440
Sir.

538
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.050
Sir.

539
00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:13.520
- Cong Shun, take five people to the cave on the cliff and set up with bows and arrows. 
 - Yes.

540
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.250
Dawang and Xiaoliu, take several people behind the creek

541
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.900
- and wait for orders. 
 - Yes!

542
00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.960
Everyone else, go to your respective positions

543
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.180
and wait for orders.

544
00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.620
Let's go!

545
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:30.620
Sir, everyone has already been deployed according to your plans.

546
00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.090
But why do you think that Phoenix Village is near here?

547
00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.390
On this mountain, there are three sources of water.

548
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:40.340
One is at the foot of the mountain and is used by the residents.

549
00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:43.960
Another is a plentiful water source that is located on level ground.

550
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:49.830
And then there is this one where the terrain is narrow and rugged.

551
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:56.280
Think about it. If you were a bandit, which one would you choose?

552
00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.620
I would naturally choose the place where the water is plentiful.

553
00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.220
Wrong.

554
00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:02.720
Look over there.

555
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.810
Although it is very narrow and isn't wide enough, but it runs through from top to bottom.

556
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.550
The terrain is rugged, dangerous, and complicated.

557
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:15.670
As far as a bandit is concerned, the more rugged the terrain, the easier it is to defend.

558
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:21.180
So unless I have guessed wrong, Phoenix Village should be near here.

559
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:25.210
Although what you said makes sense, but... but this...

560
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:28.510
Near the water source is a blind spot with a radius of 15 kilometers.

561
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.760
Even if we lie in wait, we can't succeed with one strike and can only wait.

562
00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.470
We can only wait for the bandits to descend the mountain.

563
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.270
We can only find the precise location when we find him.

564
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:42.230
If no one comes down before dark, then we will attack our way up.

565
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.520
Boss! Boss?

566
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.610
Boss, drink some water.

567
00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.080
I don't want to drink.

568
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.090
I want to die of thirst

569
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.330
as a sacrifice for lost love.

570
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:07.050
Come on. There's no need for you to act this way.

571
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:10.770
Drink this bowl of water then go and change.

572
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:12.710
Why do I have to change?

573
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.400
You forgot?

574
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.120
Boss Duan has already said

575
00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.160
that you are considered Adviser Tan's family.

576
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.530
Tonight, you are to marry her off.

577
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:23.940
Screw him!

578
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.520
If he really dares to forcibly marry my wife,

579
00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.770
I will have my father

580
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.380
conquer this mountain village so he regrets it!

581
00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:41.910
Boss, by the time your father arrives, they'll be gone.

582
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:43.700
What about Tang Feilong?

583
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.470
Doesn't he have a lot of skill?

584
00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:48.960
Where is he?

585
00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:54.010
Tang Feilong? Where are you?

586
00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.540
Wife has run away!

587
00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.760
You useless person! Screw you!

588
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:07.360
You're more useless than me!
