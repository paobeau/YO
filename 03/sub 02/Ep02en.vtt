I need to find the pharmacy but...

25
00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.950
Are you feeling sick again?

26
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.960
Why... do I feel like it's all over?

27
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.270
There's no reason it would end like this.

28
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.970
Do you want to marry me?

29
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.060
I... won't question it for now, since it seems like something is going on.

30
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.270
What?

31
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.280
What are you not going to question?

32
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.360
The marriage. I'm not doing that.

33
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.500
With who?

34
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.150
With you.

35
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.350
Why would you... marry me?

36
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.850
<i>Do you want to marry me?</i>

37
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.810
No, that was just an expression of my extreme gratitude.

38
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.060
I meant I am so thankful, I could marry you...

39
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.200
Wow, thanks so much! I love you! Like...

40
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.670
This type of expression. Do you get it?

41
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.400
Not... at all.

42
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.810
Oh, you don't understand? I see...

43
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.470
I was too overboard in showing my gratitude. I'm really thankful.

44
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.110
I would be even more grateful if you could just forget everything that happened today, including this.

Wait...

46
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.610
You seem a bit flustered right now. Would you like a ride?

47
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.070
No, no, no, no... I'm fine now. I'm okay, you should go.

48
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.130
- Miss Jang Hari— 
 - I'm telling you, I'm fine. Why do you keep—

49
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.770
You're very... friendly.

50
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.380
Cut it out! Stop that, and come down already.

51
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.220
I said I'll do it. Goodness.

52
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.440
Hey, look at me. I'm a woman that can even change lightbulbs.

53
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.780
Why would I let you do these kinds of cool things? You just keep calm and watch the baby.

54
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.760
You're plenty attractive without changing the lights on the front door, so you should just make me do all the work.

55
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.480
I didn't welcome you in to make you do work.

56
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.860
The women of this household have lived without a man for 30 years.

57
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.900
Will that work? I have to repay you somehow. I'm the only man in this house now.

58
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.730
Just lift your spoon (lift and give sound similar in Korean). That's what you're supposed to do at your wife's house.

59
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.560
Wife's house?

60
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.250
I'm saying just think of this place as your wife's house, and be comfortable here.

61
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.760
Tell Hari to watch over Doha too. She'd do a great job.

62
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.710
Why would Hari watch Doha?

63
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.730
She's Doha's stepmo—

64
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.430
Stepmo—

65
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.090
New family member.

66
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.250
Oh, new family member.

67
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.120
Hari really loves children.

68
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.020
She's so good at watching over them. Okay?

69
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.340
I mean, I do know. But why...

70
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.290
Here, drink this.

71
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.650
You really didn't need to. Thank you.

72
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.820
You need to rejuvenate.

73
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.960
Wow, it's herbal medication.

74
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.500
I hoped someone of high reputation would come in but someone in this state came.

75
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.990
Mommy!

76
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.610
Teacher. Teacher.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.140

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.690

81
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.550
No, I'm fine.

82
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.120
Can you come to Eun Joo's wedding this weekend?

83
00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.130
I have a deadline to meet.

84
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.100
Isn't the deadline before the weekend?

85
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.910
Just stop by for a bit, your aunt will be upset.

86
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.390
I'll think about it.

87
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.260
What do you mean you'll think about it?

88
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.340
<i>Is a deadline something life-threatening? You always use that as an excuse.</i>

89
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.030
<i>Your aunt knows you're avoiding events like weddings and baby showers on purpose!</i>

90
00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:42.220
What have you been doing while your young cousins are all getting married?

91
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.910
You look even more pathetic if you skip out on occasions like this.

92
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:53.700
You have to act confident and go congratulate them.

93
00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.750
Did I commit some kind of sin?

94
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.900
What do you mean "be confident?"

95
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.690
Do you have to have a husband and some kids to be considered successful?

96
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.500
Okay, you brat.

97
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.820
Mom, I really...

98
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.680
What?

99
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.920
<i>I'll cook for you, so come home early.</i>

100
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.250
Forget it, I'm hanging up.

101
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.660
Come here, come here.

102
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.360
Why did you get here just now? The Department Head is really angry right now.

103
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.100
Oh, yes.

104
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:07.300
Yes.

105
00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.200
Department Head, you're here? Weren't you supposed to come back next week?

106
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.260
How could I not come out in a situation like this?

107
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.280
Why? It's all been resolved.

108
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.990
From now on, if the advertisement team messes up, make them fix it.

109
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:22.290
Why were you doing the pregnancy experiment?

110
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.070
It still helped our sales.

111
00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.800
Then you can do the filming for Ego, too.

112
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.060
What?

113
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.370
Ego said they wouldn't renew the contract. I think the advertisement team has given up, so you should go and catch them.

114
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.740
Hand it over to Deputy Jang.

115
00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:37.760
What? I worked hard getting that sponsorship.

116
00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.030
Why would that come to me?

117
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.160
Why do you keep giving me more work? I'm not on the advertising—

118
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.620
If you want to disrespectfully lecture your superiors in front of your juniors,

119
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.660
then you should've been Chief Editor yourself.

120
00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.800
Do you think I left my children at home for work to listen to your complaining?

121
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.460
I'll head home early and start on that tomorrow.

122
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.640
Do your work.

123
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:31.240
Hey, did you hear Kyungjin chose a date for next month?

124
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:35.660
That's what I'm saying. Everyone's really getting married now.

125
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.840
I heard Yongsook's son is going to Seyeon University?

126
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.020
Yeah.

127
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.190
Is your daughter going to college next year?

128
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:42.940
Yes.

129
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.240
Wow, time sure goes by fast.

130
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:53.810
<i>[Episode 2 - Am I doing well?]</i>

131
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:10.010
What the— Are they sleeping already, with all the lights off?

132
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:15.320
Oh, god! You scared me!

133
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.540
What are you doing?

134
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.850
You are full of all sorts... all sorts.

135
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.970
Here! Aunty asked me to give this to you. She says your cousin is getting married before you.

136
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:32.850
Not you, too.

137
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.150
That must be why you seem a little depressed.

138
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.820
Not really.

139
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:44.580
In my twenties, I thought I would get married when I was ready. In my thirties, it felt like an exam.

140
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.820
Like I had to study men and dating. I attended more blind dates than interviews.

141
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:56.670
Now that I am approaching my forties, I know that dating and marriage are impossible, no matter how hard I try.

142
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.450
Hey, what should I do now?

143
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:04.730
What do you mean, "what should you do"? Just give up. If life always happened as we wanted, no one would be living a crappy life.

144
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.910
Even then, wouldn't things have turned out better if I tried a little harder?

145
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.830
Well, it's just...

146
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:17.370
Since I regret losing yesterday, I am reflecting so that I don't lose tomorrow, too.

147
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:19.450
But how do you—

148
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.710
Nevermind.

149
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:27.920
What did you put on your stomach? Are you constipated? Remove it.

150
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:35.120
Let it be. This is my current regret and possible loss to come.

151
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.800
I want to stay like this for a while longer.

152
00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.600
Fine. Do what you need to.

153
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:46.960
You are full of all sorts.

154
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.030
<i>I came to ask you for a favor but seeing how you are, I don't think I need to ask.</i>

155
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.850
<i>What favor did you want to ask from me?</i>

156
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:15.060
<i>Hari looks like she's going to always be alone. I guess she has no plans to get married.</i>

157
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:20.010
<i>She is always going between work and home, work and home. What if she ends up alone?</i>

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:26.130
<i>Why do you say alone? She'll find someone and live a great life, I'm sure.</i>

159
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.560
<i>Jaeyong, stay beside her and support her.</i>

160
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.680
<i>You need to be with people in order to meet new people.</i>

161
00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.970
<i>And then, both of you can just keep living together.</i>

162
00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.170
<i>Aunty, why are you saying something so horrible?</i>

163
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:43.630
<i>My Hari is horrible?</i>

164
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.840
<i>It's a bit...</i>

165
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.490
<i>You know she and I are like real siblings.</i>

166
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.680
<i>That's what I am trying to say. Live together like real siblings.</i>

167
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.860
Ugh, seriously!

168
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.170
She really does know how to make someone concerned.

169
00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:20.560
Hey! Get up! Lets have a glass of soju. Get up!

170
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.030
Get lost!

171
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.010
Fine. Then let's have a beer.

172
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.890
Beer, this little—

173
00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:29.930
What are you doing? Slapstick? Your face is funny looking enough already.

174
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.800
Here!

175
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.690
- Take this and leave. Don't come back again. 
 - What is this?

176
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.920
I bought underwear for Doha as a farewell present.

177
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.090
Goodbye. Let's not see each other again. Leave.

178
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:44.180
You even bought something like this.

179
00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:48.790
Yes, since I bought something like that for you, please leave. I don't like seeing you.

180
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.930
I don't think I can leave. Our fates are like that.

181
00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.700
What are you saying? Just leave, quickly. Go.

182
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.230
As a reward for this present...

183
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.820
should I introduce you to a guy?

184
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:14.080
Well... did I say I needed a man?

185
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:25.310
Do you really not need one? You seemed to be kicking yourself earlier about not having one.

186
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.480
Well, it seems a bit early to give up.

187
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.930
So, will you go on a blind date?

188
00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:43.160
Forget it. There is no guarantee that I will meet a nice guy even if I try hard.

189
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:48.040
Well... if you know someone with a good personality,

190
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:52.060
if he has a fit body, and a good sense of humor,

191
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:58.300
I don't look at faces, so an average person would be nice.

192
00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.390
What was that? Do you want to do it or no? If I know someone like that, are you saying yes?

193
00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.160
If you know someone like that, then set it up for me.

194
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.980
There's too much going on in your head, right? Just pick one voice.

195
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.660
I'll use the underwear well, thank you.

196
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.050
Brush your teeth and go to sleep.

Ha, this—

215
00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:09.260
It's so sad, why would you come here?

216

There aren't a lot of kid zones around.

You've been out for five months, right? What about expenses?

218
00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:18.720
I sold my house.

219
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:19.990
Aren't you going to go back to work?

220
00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.890
I don't know. Finding someone to look after the baby all day is difficult.

221
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.410
Oh! What is this?

222
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.400
Junghwan asked me to give you this for child support.

223
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.090
If she is going to abandon our child and run away, tell her to mind her own business.

224
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.240
Being once married means that even after a divorce, it is difficult to become strangers.

225
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.530
Although, I succeeded in becoming strangers.

226
00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.570
Bro!

227
00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.220
Would you like to go on a blind date?

228
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.330
What is this uncomfortable thing?

229
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:29.720
- Team Leader! 
 - Yes?

230
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.360
- I ran into that person, Han Yisang. 
 - Huh?

231
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.610
After saying he didn't like me,

232
00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:39.900
why is he liking my photos?

233
00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.910
Should I make a fuss?

234
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.160
What is this? Why are you here?

235
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:58.120
Following people and sending likes, isn't that what you do on this app?

236
00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120
Are we close?

237
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.510
Do you only do that with people you are close to? You also follow people you don't know.

238
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.400
I only follow people I am close to.

239
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.000
Ah. Okay then, unfriend me.

240
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.610
I didn't accept your request so you should cancel it.

241
00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:11.090
Okay!

242
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.070
You two are friends on social media?

243
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:17.260
You must be really close then. I hope you continue being close friends.

244
00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.000
I think I should be upset about this situation.

245
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.390
You said I wouldn't see her.

246
00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:27.870
I was trying to make sure you wouldn't but I didn't prepare at all and you met, so I'm in a tough spot.

247
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.860
Today... you dislike me a little more.

248
00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:43.160
You said you were so thankful you could marry me.

249
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:48.160
<i>It is my expression of extreme gratitude. I am so thankful, I could marry you.</i>

250
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:56.630
Mr. Han Yisang! No, Team Leader Han, let's have a proper conversation.

251
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.520
Just the both of us.

252
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.100
You are not going to continue being at the studio, right?

253
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.310
Why?

254
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.810
Let's check our schedules, so we can avoid running into each other.

255
00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.470
Why?

256
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.510
Do you find seeing me uncomfortable? I find seeing you uncomfortable.

257
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.090
I am actually all right now, do you still find me uncomfortable?

258
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:26.440
It would be strange if it was comfortable. The first time we met, you asked me to raise a dog.

259
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:32.310
If you say that, then I should be more uncomfortable with you.

260
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.920
- What do you mean? 
 - Don't you remember?

261
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.360
What would be uncomfor—

262
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.120
<i> Oh my days! </i>

263
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:13.120
<i>Hey, where are you going? </i>

264
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.920
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

265
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.040
<i>Just sit down.</i>

266
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:31.360
<i> Are you a misogynist? </i>

267
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.550
<i>- Excuse me? 
 - I mean... Well,</i>

268
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:40.520
<i>do you act like that whenever a girl shows an interest in you? </i>

269
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:46.240
<i>How did you develop that terrible prejudice?</i>

270
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.350
<i>A different prejudice is starting to form right now.</i>

271
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.310
<i>Do you think I won't understand because I'm drunk?</i>

272
00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.600
<i>You're saying that you don't like me.</i>

273
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.890
<i>I don't like you either.</i>

274
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.090
<i>If I knew you were crazy, I wouldn't have built up the courage either.</i>

275
00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.020
<i>You judged me correctly.</i>

276
00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.390
<i>I'm not the type of guy you're looking for.</i>

277
00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:27.330
<i>What are you going to do if you fall in love with me?</i>

278
00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:33.370
<i>I'm saying that you'll really fall in love with me.</i>

279
00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:37.330
No matter how drunk someone is, who would do that?

280
00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:46.610
You said I'd fall in love with you.

281
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.390
- Did you fall in love with me? 
 - No.

282
00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.140
- Are you going to fall in love with me? 
 - No. 
 - Then, what do you want?

283
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.650
Why are you asking me that?

284
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.540
You're the one who said it.

285
00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:04.890
No matter what, let's try to avoid one another to avoid any discomfort. So please cooperate.

286
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:08.290
- Okay. 
 - Let's work hard to never see each other.

287
00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.630
- I will. 
 - That was quick and tidy. Here.

288
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.350
This is for mine.

289
00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:23.870
What do you mean by that? You don't have the photo?

290
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.820
I have an interview with Yeonho. If the model is not here yet, what can we do?

291
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:32.320
- No, they said they're on their way. 
 - Do you really think that we can set up and finish shooting in one hour?

292
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:36.490
Yeonho said it was a meeting with a famous writer from abroad. I can't do both.

293
00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:41.690
It's the cover shoot. We can't push it back. We have to shoot video, too.

294
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.050
It was hard to recruit Naeun, whose popularity is skyrocketing amongst the internet aunties.

295
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.430
- Aunt! 
 - See, I told you about the aunts!

296
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.570
Is he crazy or something?

297
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:56.660
Hello! I'm Choikang Eutteum from the Advertising Team.

298
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.950
You used to be an idol, right? I feel like I've seen you somewhere before!

299
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:04.270
No, no. I used both of my parents' last names, so it's Choikang.

300
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.100
- Ah, you use both last names. 
 - Eutteum, why are you here?

301
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.990
Department Head Kim told me it was an important advertisement, so they told me to come here and assist.

302
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.670
It's an important advertisement but they sent you?

303
00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:18.230
I didn't know that they thought so highly of me either. I will do my best to help out!

304
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.000
Hari, we don't have time. Let's make a decision.

305
00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:35.110
I'm not going to do it.

306
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.760
You won't do it?

307
00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.340
Since you're not saying you can't, that means you can! Please just do it this once.

308
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:44.750
Your work is yours. My work is mine. We just agreed to use the space together.

309
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:50.290
This is a great part-time gig! You can get money, get the feel of things again, and feel good.

310
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.850
Why are you making our cover shoot sound like a practice round?

311
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.210
I'm just saying it for this.

312
00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:58.990
Let's stop. We're being so obsequious.

313
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.700
I'm sorry for asking you to avoid me and then asking this favor.

314
00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.110
But...

315
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.630
why do you make us face your back while talking to you?

316
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.550
It's... It's not even that broad of a back, either!

317
00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.860
You're here! Oh, thanks for coming all this way.

318
00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.960
- Hello! 
<i> - Hello!</i>

319
00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.690
Hey, Seungho! Look at the time. Time.

320
00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:41.620
Time.

321
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.730
All right. Naeun, let's go with this. This setup. This setup.

322
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.970
- Hurry up and get ready! We don't have time! 
 - Since we don't have much time, I'll explain really concisely.

323
00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.820
It's harmless to the human body, so it's fine if children suck on it.

324
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.590
- Please consider that point. 
 - You shouldn't eat it! It's dirty. It's dirty.

325
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:07.240
Yes... Well, if there's anything else you'd like us to emphasize.

326
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:11.460
Yes, and... it's very strong.

327
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.690
You know how children throw things while playing? Even if they throw it, it won't break easily.

328
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.990
This is so weak.

329
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.220
And... And... And...

330
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.470
Oh! Something urgent suddenly came up.

331
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.430
Would you be able to assemble it?

332
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.440
Oh, of course! I could do it with my eyes closed. Don't worry.

333
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.450
Thanks in advance.

334
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.770
Of course, goodbye.

335
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.320
- How much time do we have left? 
 - Seungho!

336
00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.260
Seungho! Attention! What time is it?

337
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.200
- It's 3:50. 
 - Ten minutes left.

338
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.860
- My hands are shaking. 
 - We can do it.

339
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.970
This can't be it!

340
00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.520
Auntie! Is this the right way to do this?

341
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.560
I'm really busy right now. Can you please just leave me alone?

342
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.980
Hari!

343
00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.540
He's someone who shouldn't leave us alone.

344
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.010
Do I just need to put this in here?

345
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:23.530
So pretty.

346
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.130
No, no. It's not going to work.

347
00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.220
- What are you doing? 
 - Oh, the thing is,

348
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.920
I really need to go to Yeonho. If something goes wrong, it will be a national disgrace.

349
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.930
What are you talking about? We can't find another time for Naeun.

350
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:40.220
Just a few. Please just take a few and go.

351
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.290
Give me the camera.

352
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.630
I don't like kids. You deal with her expressions.

353
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.780
What's the point?

354
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.630
Oh! Just get her to smile slightly to get a baby model feel

355
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.280
and make sure you can see the toys well! Here. There's a deadline, so...

356
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.450
I'll leave it to you! Sorry! Thanks!

357
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.110
I'm sorry!

358
00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.660
Hi! Little princess. Here, here!

359
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.360
Naeun! Smile!

360
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:26.210
Excuse me, fix your face. The baby might cry.

361
00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.880
Does my back still not look broad to you?

362
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.430
Now, it does look a little broader.

363
00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:41.090
Naeun! Naeun!

364
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:43.390
Look! Look! Naeun! Bubbles!

365
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:48.060
So pretty! Do you like these bubbles, Naeun?

366
00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.730
What about Section Chief Kim from the Publishing Team?

367
00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:01.250
There's a rumor that he's gay.

368
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.180
What about Senior Oh from Monthly Fashion?

369
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:10.390
He's had a girlfriend for 7 years!

370
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:15.720
What should we do about Hari? It's really dark under

371
00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.350
the lamp.

372
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:25.290
Office couples have a lot of sympathy for each other, understand each other well, and really understand each other's struggles. It's really ideal.

373
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.360
But it's hard to find.

374
00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:34.790
- You, do you want to date someone at our office? 
 - No! Our office sucks!

375
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:40.080
Look. She works here but for a boyfriend, it's not great.

376
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.210
If you look at office workers, they gossip behind other people's backs. It's not like people have eyes behind their heads.

377
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:47.620
I'm dating Seungho from the Video Team.

378
00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.490
- Since when? 
 - Since when?

379
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.450
The day that Senior Hari said that she was my future, I confessed my feelings to him.

380
00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.460
- That's admirable. 
 - Thank you.

381
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.850
The conclusion is that at an office where men and women are together, there is a reason that there are office couples.

382
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:08.720
If we can't find him outside, we have to keep an eye on the palace.

383
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.160
Well, he'll be at the shop anyway.

384
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.090
I'm on my way because I have some stuff to do in Gangnam. If I sell in Gangnam, ah, how much did you sell?

385
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:29.090
Okay. Yes!

386
00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:30.890
Oh, Hari.

387
00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.420
- Are you going on a blind date? 
 - No.

388
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.980
Even if you're not going on a blind date, can you carry all those heavy things in that outfit?

389
00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:42.900
It's the weekend so taxis will be hard to find, too. Hey! You should take her. You said you were going to Gangnam.

390
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.880
- I'm not going. 
 - You're not?

391
00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.030
It's fine.

392
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:50.970
I'll be on my way.

393
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:56.080
Will she be able to carry all those heavy— She can.

394
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.680
I was lying about not going. I'll drop you off. Get in.

395
00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.740
- I'm not getting in. 
 - It'll be boring, so let's go together.

396
00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.870
I'm not bored.

397
00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.800
Do I just have to wait until you leave?

398
00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.310
Since we decided not to see each other, I'll get in the back.

399
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:58.640
Thank you.

400
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.100
Yes.

401
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.310
♫ <i>Every day I find a light to make me shine</i> ♫

402
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.380
I'll see you later.

403
00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:19.260
♫ <i>It's okay if I have to wait a while</i> ♫

404
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:24.680
♫ <i>Like the feeling when you fall in love</i> ♫

405
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.250
♫ <i>Take me up (take me up), to the stars (to the stars)</i> ♫

406
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.930
♫ <i> I'm feeling raindrops in my hair </i> ♫

407
00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.530
♫ <i>They fall softly</i> ♫

408
00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:39.780
I heard you're going to the wedding hall. It's on my way. Get in.

409
00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.490
Do I have to open the door for you?

410
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.570
♫ <i>Just with you</i> ♫

411
00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.120
♫ <i> Just like now </i> ♫

412
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:58.970
Thank you.

413
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.270
My cousin is having a wedding here.

414
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:12.270
- Since you brought me all the way here, would you like to eat before you go? 
 - No.

415
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.560
The king crab here is amazing.

416
00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.240
Then I'll treat you next time, thank you.

417
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.340
King crab?

418
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.480
- Congrats, Aunt! 
 - Thanks, Hari.

419
00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.150
- You must be busy. 
 - I was a bit busy.

420
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.510
Go over there.

421
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.200
Welcome!

422
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.560
Thank you.

423
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560
You're here.

424
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.820
There was so much traffic.

425
00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:46.390
Why did you come dressed prettier than the bride?

426
00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:47.820
She's embarrassed.

427
00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.390
Congratulations. You must be really happy.

428
00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:58.040
Hari couldn't make it because of her work, she is really sorry.

429
00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.560
What are you talking about? Hari isn't dead and already arrived!

430
00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.490
Go over there.

431
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.550
Congrats!

432
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:16.220
You look so pretty! I'm about to cry.

433
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.220
People would think you raised me.

434
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.190
I thought you couldn't come.

435
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.860
I tried hard to get here.

436
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:25.880
I prepared a huge gift.

437
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.770
What?

438
00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:44.100
If you were coming, you should have said so. Even if we make excuses, we gotta work together.

439
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.480
When I thought it over, this is a hot place.

440
00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.990
All the single men are gathered here and they want to get married after attending the wedding.

441
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:53.460
What are you going on about?

442
00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:00.330
Stop shaking.

443
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:01.660
It's because I'm nervous.

444
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.290
Are you the one getting married? Why would you be?

445
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:14.590
Next, we have a guest performer

446
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.980
who would like to perform a wedding song to wish the couple happiness.

447
00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.680
Our bride's cousin.

448
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:21.950
Where are you going?

449
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:24.160
Please come up.

450
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.650
Hari!

451
00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.470
What is she doing?

452
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:38.720
Hello. I'm the bride's cousin, Jang Hari.

453
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.050
I know I look too young to be her older cousin, but still.

454
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.280
I'm a little older than her.

455
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.500
I can't sing well.

456
00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:55.110
I'm lacking but please accept it as

457
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:57.730
me congratulating my younger cousin's wedding.

458
00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:01.820
Music, cue!

459
00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.460
<i> Fill me with love</i>

460
00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:25.340
<i> My love battery must be dead</i>

461
00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:29.760
<i> I can't live without you, I can't live</i>

462
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:33.350
<i> You're my battery</i>

463
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.990
<i> It's okay if you don't have the perfect face</i>

464
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.700
<i>It's okay if you don't have the perfect body</i>

465
00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:44.010
<i>One that's always there for me</i>

466
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:48.020
<i>Is the perfect one for me</i>

467
00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:51.790
<i>Please hold me one more time</i>

468
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.360
<i>Hold me like my chest will explode</i>

469
00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.740
<i>My love battery is out of juice</i>

470
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.930
<i> I need you</i>

471
00:38:01.930 --> 00:38:05.430
<i> Fill me with love</i>

472
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.290
<i> My love battery must be dead</i>

473
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:16.960
<i> I can't live without you, I can't live, you're my battery</i>

474
00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:58.990
What are you doing? Why are you blocking my future?

475
00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:01.220
I'm not blocking anything.

476
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.430
You... just...

477
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.190
Why did you come?

478
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.080
Meal ticket.

479
00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.560
I never tried king crab before, only flower crab.

480
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:25.640
Thank you.

481
00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.840
The food is this way.

482
00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.140
I was about to get lucky, though.

483
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.730
Hari, stop already. You look so desperate.

484
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:47.070
If you get what I'm doing, help me out.

485
00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.990
How old is Eunjoo's husband? 32? 33?

486
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.730
Does he have an older brother? A younger uncle wouldn't be that bad.

487
00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.510
Don't embarrass yourself and just eat.

488
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.530
Mom, can you look after him?

489
00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.800
- All right. 
 - I'll be back in a bit.

490
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.970
Hwiseo, your mom will be back soon.

491
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.250
What do you want to eat?

492
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:10.360
Aw, you eat so well!

493
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.590
You were good at singing.

494
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:20.290
Hari, you're good at your job, just live alone.

495
00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:24.450
You can't get married and you don't have any kids. It's more comfortable to live alone.

496
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.950
It's fine if you're a little lonely at times.

497
00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:32.560
- You can earn a lot of money and move to Silver Town. 
 - Yeah.

498
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.500
But have you heard about old people getting beat up there?

499
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.490
That's evil. Evil.

500
00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.720
You're right.

501
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.450
Eat up.

502
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.210
I'm going to get married.

503
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:50.210
My mom should also blow the candle and get congratulated.

504
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:55.190
If you know someone nice, introduce me. Aunt, if you find someone, set a date right away.

505
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.360
You all heard, right?

506
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.400
The king crabs have come out.

507
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.670
Aunt wait-

508
00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:14.950
Aunt! Aunt!

509
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.830
Caring about snow crabs more than you.

510
00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:33.780
How many men did Aunt introduce to you? There's no one left. Who's going to introduce you when you're forty in two days?

511
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:38.260
Don't you know the constellation has been cut off for a few years? You're so tactless.

512
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.630
These days, who gets married this early?

513
00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:00.420
No one at your age has yet to get married.

514
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.340
There's no need to hurry. Your partner should show up at any time now.

515
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:14.210
I thought I couldn't get married because of my bad luck.

516
00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:21.460
You also don't have luck because of me. You don't even know the joy of having a son-in-law and grandchild.

517
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:27.100
Why don't I know? Is that something so great? I know even though I don't have them.

518
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:33.220
Also, don't look around me.

519
00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.240
Find a man near you.

520
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.830
Don't you know? The Blue Bird will be in the small room of your house.

521
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.200
Why is that there?

522
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.840
Why did you go to Gangnam? I told you that I would come here.

523
00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:15.530
I went to go see someone dance.

524
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:17.110
Dance?

525
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.390
Jang Hari!

526
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.630
Look, it's the dancer.

527
00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.290
Dancer? Where?

528
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:52.790
- Where? 
 - It's nothing.

529
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:55.670
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

530
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.660
It's dinner time, would you like to go out and eat something?

531
00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.190
I already ordered. What would you like?

532
00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:08.020
Iced americano.

533
00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:10.350
- What? 
 - Just a moment!

534
00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.670
Should we get going?

535
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:17.560
I'm going to stay here a little longer. I want another cup of coffee. Their coffee is really good.

536
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.780
That's a hot americano.

537
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:30.750
Guess I'll have the iced one then.

538
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.990
You heard about me from Jaeyoung, right?

539
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:38.190
I heard you were married for a little bit.

540
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.360
You must be concerned about meeting a divorcee.

541
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.390
I got looked down on so much because I still hadn't gotten married.

542
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:47.140
There are times when I think it's better to have been married before.

543
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.830
I got married at 40 as well.

544
00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.210
I am sure you never thought you would be unmarried at this age.

545
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:58.960
Yes.

546
00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.350
As you get older, meeting people becomes more difficult.

547
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.130
Actually, it becomes a burden. Right?

548
00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:12.130
I know from my marriage experience, you have to adjust to your spouse and also to your spouse's family.

549
00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:14.350
It's not easy.

550
00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:22.340
Dating and marriage are very difficult.

551
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.200
How about we...

552
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:37.400
Even if it may take a long time, how about we slowly get to know each other?

553
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:46.380
If you say slowly for a long time, how much time?

554
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:49.360
If I get older, it will be difficult to have a child.

555
00:45:50.830 --> 00:45:55.310
Regarding children, as long as you have money, you can have children in your sixties.

556
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:58.200
Even Trump had his youngest son in his sixties.

557
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.350
Women can't have kids in their sixties.

558
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.380
So if I have approximately 10 years until menopause,

559
00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:13.380
in a year twelve times, in ten years 120 times. I have only 120 chances to get pregnant.

560
00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.950
Within that, how many times do you think it is possible?

561
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:20.980
I couldn't do it for ten years. There is no guy and I don't know when I will get married.

562
00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.680
Even then, it needs to be a time when I have plenty eggs.

563
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.700
So I am trying to say that I am jealous.

564
00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:43.580
I am jealous of men.

565
00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.580
Ah! Doha!

566
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.250
Did you wake up from your sleep?

567
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.970
Oh! It's okay! It's okay.

568
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:19.340
<i> [We love to make coffee for the city that loves] </i>

569
00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:33.250
♫ My darling Doha's food. Let's eat food ♫

570
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.930
♫ Let's eat food ♫

571
00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.580
Let's eat, but...

572
00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:42.320
♫ Doha's daddy's food. Doha's daddy's... Doha's daddy's... ♫

573
00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.730
♫ Daddy's food ♫

574
00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.860
Let's go.

575
00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.890
Do you live near? I live in this neighborhood.

576
00:47:54.890 --> 00:48:00.830
I didn't think the guy from earlier would share his umbrella with you, so I ran to buy one.

577
00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.620
Shall we share an umbrella?

578
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.630
Are you having fun?

579
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.880
You were watching from afar on purpose, right?

580
00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:14.370
Don't get angry.

581
00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:18.390
Don't you know how to apologize?

582
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.610
Why do you always appear at my worst moments to make me feel embarrassed?

583
00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.360
What's wrong with you?

584
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.310
Don't follow me.

585
00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:34.130
I mean, I thought immaturely and took a look.  I mean...

586
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:37.430
I didn't mean to make you feel embarrassed. I am sorry.

587
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.760
Jang Hari! Jang Hari! Jang Ha...

588
00:48:40.760 --> 00:48:42.550
Jang Hari...

589
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.180
Why did this rip?

590
00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:49.020
My clothes!

591
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:51.080
<i> I'm sorry.</i>

592
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:56.400
Jang Hari!

593
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.750
Jang Hari!

594
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:05.350
What are you doing? What the— What? Ah!

595
00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.520
Hari! Are you okay?

596
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.290
- What are you doing? 
 - You jerk, what do you think you are doing?

597
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:12.240
Let go of me.

598
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.190
Why are you behaving like this?

599
00:49:14.190 --> 00:49:15.780
Who are you? A burglar? Public security?

600
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:17.370
What do you do? What's your profession?

601
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:21.470
How on earth do I look like a burglar or public security?

602
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:24.680
It's even more suspicious that you are walking around normally.

603
00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.480
You! Get over a man that talks to you like this.

604
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:32.550
What bullshit are you talking about? Let go! Let go!

605
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:47.750
You're sure something.

606
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:53.410
You are embarrassing the neighborhood. Seriously.

607
00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:01.630
Look at this.

608
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.350
My boob, boob, boob.

609
00:50:25.470 --> 00:50:27.450
My boob.

610
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.370
Stop

611
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:41.130
it! Please!

612
00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:43.060
Let go! Let go!

613
00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.390
Gosh! Why are you holding this?

614
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:47.360
Let go!

615
00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.990
Anyways, I— I'm sorry.

616
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:15.690
I didn't know you were her coworker.

617
00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:17.630
He's not my coworker.

618
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:23.000
We are no different than siblings, so I thought something happened.

619
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.550
You. You should be getting along with your coworkers. Why were you fighting in the streets?

620
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.120
- We're not coworkers.
