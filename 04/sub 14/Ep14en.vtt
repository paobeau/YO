"Love is All"

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:55.423

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.160
"Justice for the writer,
Shao Feng's date with Ru Yi"

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.250
-Sir, why are you here?
-Ling Yin.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.488
Why are you here?

00:02:15.742 --> 00:02:17.119
I drugged the guards.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.268
They won't wake up for another hour.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.903
You need to leave.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.018
We don't know why they arrested me.

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:24.542
What if they caught you in here
and use me as leverage?

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.508
I can't leave if you keep grabbing me.

00:02:29.944 --> 00:02:31.059
Is that so?

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:36.787
I am sorry for this.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.795
When I first came working
at the District Bureau,

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.742
I just wanted material for my books.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.034
I never thought so many lives
would be at stake.

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.282
This is not our fault.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.377
Someone was already after their lives.

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.398
We didn't make it in time
to save them.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.219
Even after I started working
at the District Bureau,

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.195
I brought nothing but trouble

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:01.367
Maybe you are right.

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.909
I am not suited for this job.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.479
Can I lean on your shoulder?

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.664
I feel cold.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.544
I just need a shoulder to lean on.

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:43.468
I feel cold too.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.325
Ling Yin.

00:03:53.271 --> 00:03:54.633
I could tell.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.807
You really are afraid this time.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:03:59.412
I am sorry.

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:01.941
You are here because of me.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.547
But have faith in me.

00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:08.758
The Tang Fei Long in your book
could do anything,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.211
but his namesake in real life...

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.348
will not let you down either.

00:04:16.467 --> 00:04:17.698
I believe in you.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.379
I know you won't ask for a payback.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.578
You won't mind that I used you
for my stories.

00:04:21.679 --> 00:04:23.643
Now is not the time for petty feud.

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:26.015
I'll deal with you after we got home.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.519
You are sleeping during your shift?
This is outrageous!

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:39.820
Sir, you need to go. Someone is here.

00:04:41.832 --> 00:04:43.983
-Just go.
-Don't worry.

00:04:44.703 --> 00:04:46.922
You will leave this place...

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.830
with your name cleared.

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:52.628
I must go now.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.059
That joyous look on your face,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.866
that look in your eyes,

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:27.044
you were clearly with a girl.

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.738
If you are so keen in your duty
as the Commissioner,

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:33.409
Tongling's crime rate
would be much lower.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.323
I am not like you.

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.136
If I were to choose between
success and woman,

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.956
I would choose the later.

00:05:40.223 --> 00:05:42.139
Yes, I would choose to have woman too.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.798
And speaking of you,

00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:51.559
I ordered you to bring me the books.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.095
What do we have here now?

00:05:54.799 --> 00:05:56.480
We had a foot bath together.

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.119
You two were in love
with the same woman.

00:05:58.252 --> 00:05:59.990
-That's right.
-Don't be so calculating.

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:01.258
That's right.

00:06:03.799 --> 00:06:05.186
How much did he pay you?

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:07.640
Is that how you see me?

00:06:07.741 --> 00:06:09.923
That's right.
Isn't that so, Commissioner Zheng?

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.372
Fine, he did pay me.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:18.751
Do you know how to beat
a drum and make an appeal?

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.057
Preceptor Tan.

00:06:29.612 --> 00:06:33.083
It's only been a few days and
you've committed a heinous crime.

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.858
In terms of cruelty,

00:06:36.973 --> 00:06:39.146
you are just as cruel as
any man could be.

00:06:39.341 --> 00:06:40.415
Sir.

00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:44.367
Your cunningness is just as
treacherous as a girl could be.

00:06:44.468 --> 00:06:45.558
Insolence!

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.658
I was doing just fine in Tongling.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.920
What makes you think I came here
just to kill a man?

00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:51.135
I saw it!

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.379
It was you!

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.239
You killed my husband!

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.423
Madam.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.499
Don't go back on your conscience.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.943
I don't even know you.

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:00.522
But I know you.

00:07:01.799 --> 00:07:03.000
My husband...

00:07:03.101 --> 00:07:05.194
worked his way to Chizhou
through hard work.

00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:07.229
He did so by running
a printing service.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.099
We may be just a printing service,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.146
but he had always wanted
to become a writer.

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:12.967
But no one could see his talent.

00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:14.899
You were going through his drafts.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.256
It was you...

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.939
who asked him to
hand over the story...

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.819
and promised to pay him 500 taels!

00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:21.195
500 taels?

00:07:22.799 --> 00:07:25.244
You are even better at making up
stories than I am.

00:07:25.359 --> 00:07:26.730
You should become a writer yourself.

00:07:26.831 --> 00:07:29.119
Sir, I witnessed the whole thing
two nights ago.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.112
She was having a fight
with my husband.

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.082
She resorted to vile means.

00:07:33.427 --> 00:07:35.200
She killed my husband!

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.799
Please, I need justice.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.081
My husband deserved to have justice.

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.040
Tan Ling Yin.

00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:42.518
What do you have to say?

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:44.236
What is the evidence?

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.694
Do you have any evidence?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.329
Show it to her.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.186
Why do you have this?

00:07:57.119 --> 00:07:59.366
We have both the witness
and the evidence.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.271
Sir, halt!

00:08:33.287 --> 00:08:34.362
Sir.

00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:36.013
Zhu Da Cong?

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:38.840
Sir, I am Zhu Da Cong.

00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:40.660
My father is the Governor of Jinan.

00:08:41.228 --> 00:08:42.719
I came here to make an appeal...

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.861
so that my bride could
be proven innocent.

00:08:48.599 --> 00:08:49.728
Sir, please have a look.

00:08:57.924 --> 00:09:00.624
Sir, these are the most
commonly used words...

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.119
that appears in
Miao Miao Sheng's books.

00:09:02.225 --> 00:09:04.320
Silly, fool, and naughty.

00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:05.840
They each appears 63 times,

00:09:05.944 --> 00:09:08.007
52 times and 87 times in the books.

00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:09.520
In Tang Fei Long's Mystery...

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.354
they each appears 11 times, 15 times
and 32 time respectively.

00:09:13.039 --> 00:09:15.299
The tones of the storylines
may be different,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.599
but the way of narrative...

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.520
still bears the writing style
of Miao Miao Sheng.

00:09:18.621 --> 00:09:20.200
The lines are mean and overbearing.

00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:23.131
The male protagonist is
shameless and pretentious.

00:09:23.454 --> 00:09:25.321
This is a writing unique only
to Miao Miao Sheng's work.

00:09:25.744 --> 00:09:27.114
Not bad.

00:09:29.862 --> 00:09:32.981
Those who are hired could
easily copy the style.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.686
Copying is nothing special these days.

00:09:36.787 --> 00:09:39.465
Sir, you accused my bride of murder.

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:41.073
The victim was tall and strong.

00:09:41.174 --> 00:09:43.734
My bride here is almost too
feeble for any sort of fighting.

00:09:44.359 --> 00:09:45.760
How was she able to...

00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.919
strangle the victim from behind
and stab his neck...

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:50.239
with a hairpin thrusted
by brute force?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.458
That's right.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:53.327
Those skilled in martial art...

00:09:54.574 --> 00:09:57.935
have a way to conceal their
mastery in fighting.

00:10:03.909 --> 00:10:06.324
Okay, just get to the point.

00:10:07.055 --> 00:10:09.423
How much do I have to pay
to bail my bride out?

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:11.997
Guards.

00:10:14.013 --> 00:10:16.419
This man here is trying to bribe me.

00:10:16.575 --> 00:10:19.552
Take him outside and grant him
30 heavy beatings.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.015
No!

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.756
Tang Fei Long only
gave me 15 beatings.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.336
You are giving me double?

00:10:25.582 --> 00:10:26.711
60 beatings!

00:10:28.965 --> 00:10:30.058
Wait!

00:10:30.159 --> 00:10:31.899
You are the Governor.

00:10:32.047 --> 00:10:34.012
You won't look at the evidence
and refuse to hear us out.

00:10:34.345 --> 00:10:36.599
My bride here only had a minor dispute
with that old man.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.000
So you accuse her of his murder?

00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:40.970
I should tell my father
about this injustice.

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.613
You mean to say...

00:10:43.714 --> 00:10:48.034
you witnessed the fight between
Tan Ling Yin and Master Liu?

00:10:48.553 --> 00:10:51.541
Yes, I saw it at the doorstep
of Gu Tang Workroom.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:54.559
Very well.

00:10:56.694 --> 00:10:57.790
Tan Ling Yin.

00:10:59.215 --> 00:11:03.107
Because of her jealousy for
Miao Miao Sheng's talent,

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:06.191
she murdered the man and
wished to take over the fame.

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:09.230
For this case,

00:11:09.958 --> 00:11:12.178
both witness and evidence are present.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.169
I hereby sentence her...

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.695
guilty of murder and must be
punished with execution!

00:11:22.078 --> 00:11:23.258
No!

00:11:23.359 --> 00:11:25.119
-Zhu Da Cong.
-Hold on!

00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.472
What took you so long? Save her.

00:11:35.071 --> 00:11:36.180
Master Tang.

00:11:36.911 --> 00:11:38.891
Even if you are in love with her,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.880
this is still considered
an abuse of authority.

00:11:40.981 --> 00:11:42.108
Lord Zong.

00:11:42.239 --> 00:11:43.513
You have known to be wise.

00:11:43.719 --> 00:11:46.826
You can't ruin your reputation
because of false judgement.

00:11:52.773 --> 00:11:53.916
My husband!

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:56.539
You stole his body!

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.618
-This is madness!
-We apologize.

00:11:57.719 --> 00:11:58.979
To find the truth,

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.075
we need your husband to show it.

00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:03.230
The fatal wound is at the neck.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.179
The mark is very deep and clear.

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:07.512
The skin even cracked open.

00:12:07.613 --> 00:12:10.777
This is not something a mere girl
could have done.

00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:12.237
Besides,

00:12:12.887 --> 00:12:14.557
look at his hands.

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.536
The skin is smooth and delicate.

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:18.919
There is no sign of callus.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.740
Those are clearly not
the hands of a writer.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.799
Now let's have a look...

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.036
at Tan Ling Yin's hands.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.384
She has been living on her own
away from her family.

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:31.880
She has to work day and night...

00:12:32.014 --> 00:12:33.813
writing books to make a living.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:35.824
Day or night

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:37.881
winter or spring, rain or sunshine,

00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:39.859
she never stops writing.

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:42.679
So her hands are covered in calluses.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:43.858
And these hands...

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:45.914
show that she is a true writer.

00:12:48.463 --> 00:12:50.103
Rumour of her hiring another writer...

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.943
is absurd at best.

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:55.859
Sir!

00:12:56.092 --> 00:12:57.320
What now?

00:12:57.421 --> 00:12:58.658
-Sir?
-Guards?

00:12:59.406 --> 00:13:01.970
This woman attempted to deceive me.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.505
She framed an
innocent girl for murder.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.752
Put her into prison.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.739
Sir!

00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.414
Sir!

00:13:11.944 --> 00:13:13.189
Sir!

00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:21.507
Your name is clear, why the long face?

00:13:24.783 --> 00:13:25.894
Sir.

00:13:26.727 --> 00:13:28.291
Thank you for saving my life.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.327
I will do anything I could
to repay your kindness.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.917
You already owe me
too much to begin with.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.465
So what then?

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.170
Okay, I can do anything you want.

00:13:41.415 --> 00:13:42.912
But what I have in mind...

00:13:43.119 --> 00:13:44.519
might be too complicated for you.

00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:46.431
You are silly after all.

00:13:49.757 --> 00:13:52.973
Look! Miao Miao Sheng is here!

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.107
Miao Miao Sheng!

00:13:59.599 --> 00:14:01.353
I know you care about
your readers the most.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.719
I know you are concerned
about the rumours.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.780
You are afraid of losing their trust.
So I brought them here.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.179
Miao Miao Sheng! We love you!

00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:14.006
You are an outstanding writer.

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:17.177
But I am not a good Preceptor.

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.041
You are when I think you are.

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.172
Master Miao.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.960
Please come up here.

00:14:23.061 --> 00:14:24.938
Share your thoughts with the readers.

00:14:25.479 --> 00:14:26.919
Yes!

00:14:27.101 --> 00:14:29.258
-Go on.
-Miao Miao Sheng!

00:14:29.359 --> 00:14:31.799
-Let's go.
-Miao Miao Sheng!

00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:36.235
The stage is yours, Master Miao.

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.119
Welcome, Master Miao.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.640
Miao Miao Sheng, we love you!

00:14:41.799 --> 00:14:42.837
Ladies.

00:14:43.559 --> 00:14:46.614
I am the Miao Miao Sheng
who has been writing the books.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.671
I don't have much
thoughts to share with you,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.130
that's because I started writing just
to make some decent money.

00:14:56.659 --> 00:14:59.739
But your books are great!

00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:02.179
I didn't know so many of you like me.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.825
But because of your support,

00:15:03.926 --> 00:15:06.858
I realize that even a girl
can pursue her own career.

00:15:08.222 --> 00:15:09.877
Thank you for supporting me.

00:15:09.978 --> 00:15:12.259
You will always have our support.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.182
-You have our support.
-So the girls...

00:15:14.654 --> 00:15:16.441
are just as great as the men.

00:15:16.542 --> 00:15:19.466
Yes! That is right!

00:15:19.599 --> 00:15:20.958
I owe someone my gratitude.

00:15:24.275 --> 00:15:26.719
I had caused him plenty of troubles.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.912
But he tolerates me unconditionally.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.154
He let me realize...

00:15:33.013 --> 00:15:35.140
what it's like to be in love.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.219
-That is so romantic.
-So sweet!

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.179
But he can be too full of himself.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.159
He think I am a fool
who knows nothing.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.586
But I know everything.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.125
I saw it when you were trying
to hide a smile.

00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:55.381
I saw it when you were humming a tune.

00:15:56.458 --> 00:15:59.332
I heard it when you couldn't help it
and said the word"darling".

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.463
I am not a fool, I know it all.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.113
Tang Fei Long, are you
in love with me?

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.063
My goodness!

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.138
There are so many witnesses here.

00:16:19.239 --> 00:16:20.415
Don't you back out on me.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.559
If you ever need anything,
just let me know.

00:16:37.669 --> 00:16:39.614
I will do anything I could
to repay you.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.359
-It's all right.
-You don't have to.

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.659
Just stop causing us any trouble.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.039
Fine, let's drink.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.239
The bill is on me today.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.792
Take it as my token of gratitude.

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:49.519
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.760
Cong Shun, Da Wang, and Xiao Liu.

00:16:54.479 --> 00:16:56.807
Thank you for standing out for me.

00:16:57.359 --> 00:17:00.179
The way you drew your blades
is so cool.

00:17:00.415 --> 00:17:01.775
Of course it looked cool,

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:05.707
but we didn't do much to rescue you.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.948
I appreciate it, so just
accept my thanks.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:11.840
And I must thank you as well.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.219
Although your statement
during the trial was absurd,

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.858
and it almost got me executed,

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:17.963
however,

00:17:18.064 --> 00:17:20.160
seeing that you rushed all
the way to Chizhou for me,

00:17:20.261 --> 00:17:23.040
I shall forgive you for
having a crush on me.

00:17:23.486 --> 00:17:25.812
This is not over yet,
so I don't need forgiveness.

00:17:26.997 --> 00:17:28.069
Cheers.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.744
Where is our hero of the day?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.920
District Aide Zhou and Master Tang
are personally escorting...

00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:37.532
the woman who framed Preceptor Tan.

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:39.320
I think...

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.196
he will only be back by afternoon.

00:17:41.776 --> 00:17:43.839
Master Tang's love
for Preceptor Tan...

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.488
is beyond any measurement.

00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:49.239
Those who dare to harm her...

00:17:49.341 --> 00:17:50.738
will pay dearly for it.

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:52.899
Master Tang would even
go so far as to...

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.800
personally escorting the prisoner.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.881
Er Tong, bring the wine.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:03.059
Someone might be planning to kill
the old lady.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:04.306
What?

00:18:08.047 --> 00:18:10.138
It's nothing, let's drink.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.053
We'll drink the day away.

00:18:13.374 --> 00:18:16.239
Preceptor Tan, it's brand daylight.

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.666
We should...

00:18:17.767 --> 00:18:20.498
While the Magistrate is away,
the Preceptor is in charge.

00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:22.400
-Cheers.
-Come, cheers.

00:18:22.508 --> 00:18:24.388
-Preceptor Tan wants us to drink.
-Come.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.160
Sir!

00:18:48.445 --> 00:18:50.805
Sir, you are back.

00:18:51.336 --> 00:18:53.618
Master Tang is back.

00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:55.230
He is back.

00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:57.021
Don't you have to work today?

00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.929
No, I am not at work.

00:19:00.199 --> 00:19:01.567
Why are you yelling?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.077
-Have you seen the Preceptor?
-The Preceptor?

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.343
She is at the backyard.
I'll take you to him.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:11.966
Who is asking for me?

00:19:20.703 --> 00:19:22.064
Tang Fei Long.

00:19:23.719 --> 00:19:25.639
Why were you drinking
at broad daylight?

00:19:26.095 --> 00:19:27.196
How much did you drink?

00:19:29.236 --> 00:19:30.599
You got drunk after
a couple of drink?

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.918
A couple of bottles!

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:34.079
I'll make you some hangover soup.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.333
I have to go now.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.228
Tang Fei Long, do you plead guilty?

00:19:42.079 --> 00:19:43.564
I didn't drink anything.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.059
How am I guilty?

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.701
You are bullying me.

00:19:47.241 --> 00:19:48.521
When did I ever bully you?

00:19:48.719 --> 00:19:50.061
You are picking on me.

00:19:55.679 --> 00:19:57.309
Do you plead guilty?

00:19:59.022 --> 00:20:00.487
So how should I be punished?

00:20:03.319 --> 00:20:04.611
I want to bite you.

00:20:06.094 --> 00:20:07.119
You want to bite me?

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.372
Like this?

00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.372
Are you sober now?

00:20:19.261 --> 00:20:20.402
Stop right there.

00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:24.479
Stop right there.

00:20:26.182 --> 00:20:28.182
-Commissioner Zheng.
-I am going to catch you!

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.560
How much wine did you drink,
Commissioner Zheng?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.790
Brother Zhou.

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:35.380
You are here.

00:20:35.967 --> 00:20:37.382
While Master Tang is not around,

00:20:38.199 --> 00:20:40.655
Maybe we could be partner in crimes.

00:20:44.131 --> 00:20:45.959
You haven't tried...

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.900
what a fresh koi tastes like.

00:20:48.119 --> 00:20:49.912
No? Let me catch you one.

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.995
No, don't do it!

00:20:52.119 --> 00:20:54.378
They are Master Tang's pet!
Don't eat them!

00:20:54.479 --> 00:20:57.781
Preceptor Tan ate
the other fish anyway.

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:00.359
Come on and have a look. Look at it.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.103
See?

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.899
Look at it.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.018
It's swimming all alone just like me.

00:21:07.119 --> 00:21:09.160
I should give it a swift death.

00:21:09.261 --> 00:21:10.858
No! What if Master Tang finds out?

00:21:10.959 --> 00:21:12.110
Stay still!

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.478
I am drunk anyway.

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:17.319
I am drunk I could do anything.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.996
So,

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:24.719
why do I feel like...

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.253
Miss Ru Yi...

00:21:27.473 --> 00:21:29.635
is right next to me?

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.412
Brother Zhou,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.239
you and your cousin look so similar.

00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:47.880
I am so confused.

00:21:51.094 --> 00:21:52.612
We are relative after all.

00:21:53.119 --> 00:21:54.472
Of course we look alike.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.172
I want to ask her out.

00:22:08.959 --> 00:22:10.664
But...

00:22:11.394 --> 00:22:14.715
I am afraid she would
think I am annoying.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.149
Brother Zhou, it's hard to be a man.

00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:22.450
You...

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.717
Do you really think so?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.476
Yes.

00:22:30.079 --> 00:22:31.498
I am taking her out for an hunt.

00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:32.900
I want her to see...

00:22:33.479 --> 00:22:35.301
just how dashing I can be.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.978
Maybe...

00:22:38.079 --> 00:22:40.050
Maybe I could...

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:42.824
impress her.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:45.640
But look at Miss Ru Yi.

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:50.123
She looks so thin and frail.

00:22:52.119 --> 00:22:54.100
There is no way she would
like to go hunting.

00:22:54.791 --> 00:22:57.108
No, she wouldn't like it.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.177
She would like it.

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.954
Really?

00:23:04.087 --> 00:23:06.453
Brother Zhou, do you really mean it?

00:23:06.791 --> 00:23:09.765
You could give it a try.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.239
That is great. I should get sober.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.894
I am going to ask her out.

00:23:15.177 --> 00:23:17.220
Commissioner Zheng.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.903
I have to go now.

00:23:41.252 --> 00:23:42.342
Sister.

00:23:43.943 --> 00:23:46.073
This will help with the hangover.
Drink it.

00:23:49.662 --> 00:23:51.295
Do you have something to say to me?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.025
No.

00:23:57.119 --> 00:23:58.485
I wan to say...

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.925
I am sorry.

00:24:00.743 --> 00:24:02.150
I make you worry again.

00:24:02.503 --> 00:24:03.904
If it were before this,

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:06.119
I would have yelled and lectured you.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:09.501
But I am just glad that
you came back in one piece.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.849
Finish the soup.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.859
Wipe your mouth.

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:44.361
How could I forget this?

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.852
Sir!

00:24:50.012 --> 00:24:51.760
Sir, please wait.

00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:52.939
Slow down.

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.218
I forgot to mention this.

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:56.098
I met Sang Jie's
servant in the prison.

00:24:56.199 --> 00:24:58.401
-He left a clue for us before he died.
-What is it?

00:24:59.839 --> 00:25:01.659
He knew I am a Preceptor.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.560
He didn't trust anyone in Chizhou.

00:25:03.661 --> 00:25:05.338
He knew he would die anyway.

00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:07.354
So he wrote the word...

00:25:08.557 --> 00:25:10.217
-"Jin" for me.
-Old Jin?

00:25:11.239 --> 00:25:12.439
Yes, that's him.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:15.800
If we search for that man,
does that mean we could find the gold?

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:17.599
It's a blessing to have you with me.

00:25:23.423 --> 00:25:24.612
Sir.

00:25:25.239 --> 00:25:26.342
Come back.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.626
It's okay. I am just about to leave.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.595
Where are you going?

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:35.153
Drought at the neighbouring district.
Many refugees have entered Tongling.

00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.846
-We need to make arrangement.
-Yes.

00:25:37.542 --> 00:25:38.861
If the refugees need food,

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.914
I know how to help.

00:25:43.766 --> 00:25:45.030
Sir, I have to go.

00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:46.471
Where are you going?

00:25:46.572 --> 00:25:49.207
-I must check on the refugees!
-I told you I can help!

00:26:04.552 --> 00:26:05.618
So,

00:26:06.075 --> 00:26:08.072
it's not like you get to
hunt with me every day,

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:09.985
but this rain ruined everything.

00:26:11.199 --> 00:26:13.893
You are drenched,
take off your clothes.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.978
But...

00:26:17.718 --> 00:26:20.583
We are all alone on this mountainside.

00:26:20.959 --> 00:26:22.078
This is embarrassing.

00:26:22.558 --> 00:26:23.657
Come here.

00:26:24.385 --> 00:26:26.075
-Never mind.
-Come here.

00:26:28.199 --> 00:26:30.920
Stop it, I think this is too much
for me to handle.

00:26:31.127 --> 00:26:32.254
Take it off.

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:36.515
Here, put this on.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:39.255
It would be bad if you catch a cold.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.730
Tianmu Mountain is a weird place.

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:56.358
Master Tang and Preceptor Tan ran
into danger twice here.

00:26:56.439 --> 00:26:57.899
It's like fate...

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.521
is trying to put couples in danger.

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:02.179
You seem very close with him.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:03.851
Have you known each other
for a long time?

00:27:03.936 --> 00:27:05.170
Of course.

00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:07.936
We grew up together.

00:27:08.118 --> 00:27:09.518
He has always been the genius.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:11.299
When it comes to knowledge,

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.909
he is the best in school.

00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:14.523
But I am different.

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.085
I fight, skip classes
and prank the teacher.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.160
If it wasn't for him,

00:27:19.318 --> 00:27:21.117
I would still be a student.

00:27:22.199 --> 00:27:24.779
But he looks like a prideful person,

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.591
you two don't have much in common.

00:27:27.126 --> 00:27:28.378
You are right about that.

00:27:28.479 --> 00:27:29.800
When we first met,

00:27:29.901 --> 00:27:31.505
I was so annoyed by his arrogant face.

00:27:32.239 --> 00:27:34.280
Then one day after school,

00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:35.479
I tried to tie him up.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.302
We fought all the way to
the mountain side.

00:27:37.439 --> 00:27:38.548
Then?

00:27:38.959 --> 00:27:41.456
That day is just like today.

00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:43.242
We were stuck on this mountain.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.160
We were both starving.

00:27:46.261 --> 00:27:48.419
So we set out difference aside.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.257
We caught ourselves a chicken.

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.467
Miss Ru Yi.

00:27:59.959 --> 00:28:02.739
Seeing this chicken is all alone here,

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.876
maybe we could...

00:28:05.702 --> 00:28:06.988
"Miao Sheng Parlour"

00:28:08.302 --> 00:28:09.718
We have no customers.

00:28:11.063 --> 00:28:12.372
This is a bad day.

00:28:13.253 --> 00:28:16.404
After making so much money,
it's time to give back.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.479
You saw it yourself.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.294
Supernumerary Sun died
inside my premise.

00:28:20.426 --> 00:28:23.134
The big shots are not coming any more.

00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:24.531
I...

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.773
is at the brink of losing money.

00:28:29.079 --> 00:28:32.548
The son of Governor of Jinan
is complaining about money.

00:28:33.338 --> 00:28:36.180
I am not complaining.
It's because of you.

00:28:36.479 --> 00:28:38.049
My father wrote me so many letters...

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:40.326
I have enough of them for firewood.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.758
Because of the three-month
promise with you,

00:28:43.918 --> 00:28:45.959
I am doing my best
to run this business.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.327
My father is upset with that
so he cut off my allowance.

00:28:52.686 --> 00:28:53.769
My bride.

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:56.495
What if one day...

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.538
I were to become as poor
as a beggar,

00:29:00.215 --> 00:29:01.927
would you still be with me?

00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.290
That depends on our relationship then.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.405
Well, you know...

00:29:08.506 --> 00:29:11.445
Forget it, whether you are rich
or poor as a beggar,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.098
I will never be with you.

00:29:13.246 --> 00:29:14.958
My heart belongs to Master Tang.

00:29:15.557 --> 00:29:17.008
What is so great about him?

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:20.299
If I return to my parents...

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.546
-Are you helping or not?
-Yes, sure.

00:29:22.889 --> 00:29:25.642
If Tang Fei Long could do it,
there is nothing I couldn't do.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.664
If I have to give up
Miao Sheng Parlour,

00:29:28.855 --> 00:29:30.156
I would still help you out.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.498
Thank you, I appreciate this.

00:29:33.599 --> 00:29:35.552
Cheer up, you are not short
on money anyway.

00:29:49.071 --> 00:29:50.578
This is delicious.

00:29:52.526 --> 00:29:53.806
You should try it too.

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:02.059
This is marvellous.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.623
Commissioner Zheng.

00:30:05.581 --> 00:30:08.395
If there were no way out for us,

00:30:08.986 --> 00:30:11.631
would you give up on your
chances and accept your fate,

00:30:12.079 --> 00:30:14.824
or would you fight to have a chance
for the better?

00:30:15.998 --> 00:30:18.337
In desperate situation,
safety comes first.

00:30:22.784 --> 00:30:23.961
You get the drumstick.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.690
Does it mean we are a couple now?

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.618
What else could it be?

00:30:38.719 --> 00:30:41.186
But you never said
anything nice to me.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.828
Do you want to hear it?

00:30:44.959 --> 00:30:46.285
You are all I see.

00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:50.369
And?

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.816
Since your giant face
is blocking my view,

00:30:53.408 --> 00:30:55.502
I can't see anything else.

00:30:57.479 --> 00:31:00.212
My face is perfectly slim and thin.

00:31:00.479 --> 00:31:02.389
If you pick on me again, I would...

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:04.391
-What would you do?
-I would...

00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:07.926
I would give you a giant hug of love.

00:31:10.253 --> 00:31:11.310
Tell me.

00:31:11.904 --> 00:31:13.059
Where were you yesterday?

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:14.343
I am not telling you.

00:31:15.783 --> 00:31:18.373
I can help you with the refugees.
Don't worry about it.

00:31:19.383 --> 00:31:21.040
Just carry on with your investigation.

00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:23.557
You can let me handle
the refugee relief.

00:31:24.127 --> 00:31:25.307
Don't worry about it.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.461
That is exactly why I am worried.

00:31:27.719 --> 00:31:29.699
Every time you told me not to worry,

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.338
something bad always happen.

00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:32.640
That is not true.

00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:33.940
Sir.

00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:36.977
Sir.

00:31:37.078 --> 00:31:39.131
There is a mob of refugees
outside Miao Sheng Parlour.

00:31:39.239 --> 00:31:40.800
Should we go and subdue the situation?

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.884
What is going on?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.065
Everyone, I am the Preceptor
from District Bureau.

00:32:00.239 --> 00:32:02.179
Miao Sheng Parlour is indeed
giving out free food.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.889
May I know what caused the unease?
Please help me understand.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.368
Food? Does this look
like food to you?

00:32:08.575 --> 00:32:10.426
Yes, see for yourself
what this junk is.

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:14.264
Everyone, please calm down.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.179
I understand your situation,
I'll do my best to resolve the issue.

00:32:17.364 --> 00:32:19.040
-Wait here.
-Where is she going?

00:32:19.141 --> 00:32:20.197
Where did she go?

00:32:21.839 --> 00:32:23.479
Hurry up and get it done.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.160
We can't let our customers down.

00:32:26.261 --> 00:32:27.959
-Zhu Da Cong!
-Fine, enough.

00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:30.439
My bride.

00:32:33.038 --> 00:32:34.842
-What's wrong?
-You promise free porridge for all.

00:32:34.943 --> 00:32:36.000
So why are you giving them bland soup?

00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.898
My bride, hear me out.

00:32:38.319 --> 00:32:39.909
My father is the Governor,

00:32:40.314 --> 00:32:42.050
I've seen my fair share
of charity works...

00:32:42.151 --> 00:32:43.439
and how it works.

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:45.319
This is just for show, nothing more.

00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:46.959
A portion of rice and
ten portions of water.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.482
The taste is bland enough
and it fills the stomach.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.895
You don' say,

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.498
these refugees are
helping my business.

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:55.167
With the long cue of them...

00:32:55.268 --> 00:32:56.819
outside my front door,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.280
the foreign caravan would see them...

00:32:58.381 --> 00:33:00.119
and think the food here is
too special to miss.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.742
So they booked my whole restaurant.

00:33:02.119 --> 00:33:03.138
Tell me,

00:33:03.239 --> 00:33:05.547
the refugees are humans
and you are feeding them water!

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.217
My bride.

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:11.063
When hunger takes over the mind,

00:33:11.164 --> 00:33:13.119
no one would be picky on food.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.457
I am letting them have
the food meant for VIPs.

00:33:15.573 --> 00:33:17.373
You can't blame me.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.600
The customers only order the food...

00:33:19.727 --> 00:33:21.989
just to make them look rich.

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.239
They mostly don't even eat the food.
See?

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.479
The food is intact.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.880
If I serve the customers the food,

00:33:26.981 --> 00:33:28.018
I must reheat the food...

00:33:28.119 --> 00:33:29.779
and that costs money as well.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:31.338
This is too good a deal for them.

00:33:31.439 --> 00:33:32.618
Do you see how nice I am?

00:33:32.719 --> 00:33:33.830
Zhu Da Cong.

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.218
People are born equal.

00:33:36.422 --> 00:33:38.784
Without your status,
you are just like them.

00:33:39.856 --> 00:33:41.435
I thought you were just stubborn.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.882
Now I see how shallow
and arrogant you are.

00:33:44.766 --> 00:33:46.718
You can't say that about me.

00:33:47.365 --> 00:33:48.554
I am...

00:33:48.959 --> 00:33:50.776
I did what I could and helped you out.

00:33:51.215 --> 00:33:53.113
Why must you be so mean to me?

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.520
Because you have no conscience
and you are blinded by greed!

00:33:57.621 --> 00:33:59.640
No, I am not doing any shady deal.

00:33:59.741 --> 00:34:02.265
Fine, what can I do to
make up for you?

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.707
You gave me your word.

00:34:09.879 --> 00:34:10.953
Come in.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.699
-Let's go inside!
-Let's go.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.600
-Quick, there is food!
-Let's eat!

00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:18.014
Let's have some food!

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:20.307
Master Tang.

00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:25.760
-Over here!
-I'll sit here.

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.760
Hurry up, let's go.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:30.560
You didn't pay!

00:34:30.919 --> 00:34:32.186
Stop right there!

00:34:34.622 --> 00:34:36.270
Everyone, enjoy your food.

00:34:41.771 --> 00:34:43.701
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.120
Thanks to you,

00:34:46.221 --> 00:34:47.959
I got to have a delicious chicken.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.081
If you ever get upset again,
let me know.

00:34:50.239 --> 00:34:52.234
I know how to enjoy
the finer things in life.

00:34:52.335 --> 00:34:53.477
This is unbelievable.
This is unacceptable!

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:54.822
-I am so sorry, sir.
-Unacceptable!

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.814
I am so sorry.

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.471
-This is outrageous!
-I am sorry.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.923
I am so sorry.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.780
Miss Ru Yi.

00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:10.778
So what if Miao Sheng Parlour...

00:35:10.879 --> 00:35:13.254
has to be closed,
would you be taken into custody?

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:18.968
That would be good.

00:35:19.399 --> 00:35:20.840
I could pull some strings...

00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:22.202
and make you mine.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.638
I am not an object.

00:35:28.182 --> 00:35:29.217
Miss Ru Yi.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.659
Commissioner Zheng.

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.040
Where have you been all day?

00:35:34.145 --> 00:35:35.219
-What's wrong?
-Where were you?

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.459
-What?
-We have work to do.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.560
-Let's go.
-Where are we going?

00:35:38.661 --> 00:35:40.010
-Come with us.
-Where are we going?

00:35:40.563 --> 00:35:43.040
Er Tong?

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.360
-Did they pay?
-No.

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:47.750
Served you right.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.526
As long you are happy, my bride.

00:35:51.834 --> 00:35:52.865
-Let's go.
-As long as you are happy.

00:35:52.966 --> 00:35:54.403
I can walk, don't drag me.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.040
Miao Sheng Parlour's business
is doing well.

00:35:57.142 --> 00:35:58.747
Why is it losing money?

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.179
Zhu Da Cong is making up
for his past mistake.

00:36:03.459 --> 00:36:06.000
-Keep an eye on them.
-What does that mean?

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.739
Preceptor Tan just treated
all the refugees to a feast.

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.865
No way, she is not that generous.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.459
They ate 50 taels worth of food,

00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.699
then another costs 300 taels.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.298
-300 taels?
-But...

00:36:19.399 --> 00:36:21.009
Women are so terrifying.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.578
She plays with your heart,

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:24.976
then she empties your bank.

00:36:25.077 --> 00:36:26.338
Don't be absurd.

00:36:26.439 --> 00:36:28.270
I didn't force him to do it.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.736
I can't let you lose too much money.

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.137
My father is the governor.

00:36:37.399 --> 00:36:38.645
I don't need your money.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.001
This is meant for the refugees.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.202
I'll keep this for you.

00:36:50.138 --> 00:36:53.236
Let me know later
if you need something.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.959
-Eat while you can.
-Sure, carry on.

00:36:57.399 --> 00:36:58.890
You seems very happy with
the refugee relief.

00:36:59.903 --> 00:37:01.226
Of course I am.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.800
We only aid those in immediate need.

00:37:04.901 --> 00:37:07.000
We can't just give them aid
for the rest of their lives.

00:37:07.122 --> 00:37:08.639
It's not my style to leave
them to their fate.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.199
We need to help if we can.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.458
As long as the conscience is clear.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.138
Anyway, I have you watching my back.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.602
I am not going to clean up your mess.

00:37:18.199 --> 00:37:19.899
Stop denying it.

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:21.636
Where did you send Zheng Shao Feng?

00:37:23.338 --> 00:37:25.019
There are works at
the District Bureau.

00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:27.061
There are plenty of works for him.

00:37:29.239 --> 00:37:30.520
I overheard it.

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:33.419
You are relocating the poor
of Tongling and the refugees...

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:34.793
to a new shelter.

00:37:35.376 --> 00:37:38.289
They are going to get registered
and be given incentives.

00:37:38.439 --> 00:37:40.608
It won't be much but
enough for them to survive.

00:37:41.629 --> 00:37:44.368
Preceptor, eavesdropping
is not good.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.404
You can have this as my apology.

00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:52.717
Forget it, I am eating it.

00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:54.393
Hold on.

00:38:12.959 --> 00:38:14.543
Isn't this you always write about?

00:38:14.879 --> 00:38:16.075
Why are you used to it in real life?

00:38:17.656 --> 00:38:18.745
Qing Chen?
