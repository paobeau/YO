<i>When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower</i>

3
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.060
The Leon you planted was still there.

4
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.540
Someone kept looking after it I guess.

5
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.620
That's fascinating. How can that be?

6
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.030
Actually that's not Leon.

7
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.990
Right?

8
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.860
No wonder.

9
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.830
I planted it recently.

10
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.100
Deliberately, at this place.

11
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.940
I had forgotten what this place was.

12
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.730
Because it is an asylum,

13
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.440
where the world's eyes and feet cannot touch...

14
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760
So, for just a moment...

15
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.220
I was afraid to be held back by the days of the past,

16
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.610
so I walked diligently forward, without ever looking back.

17
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.690
But once I stopped, this is where I was.

18
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.030
Perhaps I walked all those years, to reach this place.

19
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.250
Now my legs hurt

20
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.290
so for today, I'll just stay here.

21
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.860
If it's here

22
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.750
we'll be okay.

23
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.060
[Episode 9]

24
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.480
I'm going to head back.

25
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.200
Good night Jisoo.

26
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.440
Go safely.

27
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.740
Would you like to eat ramyeon before leaving?

28
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.410
You don't eat ramyeon anymore?

29
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.770
Well, not often.

30
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.100
As expected, those higher-ups from that neighborhood don't eat it.

31
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.920
I guess the ramyeon you would've eaten for a lifetime is now halved.

32
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.250
Is that how it is?

33
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.860
Are you going to leave some?

34
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.230
Huh? No.

35
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.310
Since we ate ramyeon and drank coffee at a convenience store,

36
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.050
it's like we went on a date just like young kids nowadays.

37
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.680
If we were to speak like them, is today our "day 1?" (first day of dating)

38
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.970
We... might get stoned.

39
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.990
I'm not afraid of getting stoned

40
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.030
but if we get stoned, there are those who will also get stoned with us.

41
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.930
I can take all the hits.

42
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.770
You're not some kind of Iron Man, Seonbae.

43
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.390
How can you endure with all those hits?

44
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.290
I can. Because you are here.

45
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.580
You are my Iron Man suit.

46
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:47.510
If I'm that suit, doesn't that mean I get all those hits, too?

47
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.950
Is...that how it is?

48
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.000
About 20% of the time, he is completely lucid.

49
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.430
About 50% of the time he is a patient and gentle elder.

50
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.590
The rest, well, he doesn't even have the strength to talk and is a sick senior.

51
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.330
It must be hard on you.

52
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:17.920
The person who first taught me piano was my father. "The Island Baby."

53
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.440
Did your father also play piano?

54
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.010
Only one hand. Tinker tinker.

55
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.630
While living I never understood my father. Now I do somewhat.

56
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.520
He lived as a tiger for 50 years and now he's become a kitten.

57
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.150
He must be so astounded when he becomes clear of mind every so often.

58
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.810
So, that's why he probably throws things at me and shouts at me. I understand a bit why.

59
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.650
Though I understand, I don't just take it

60
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.920
because I also get mad, too.

61
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.320
Listening to old songs on the radio is her sole hobby.

62
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.910
Your mother was also a beauty.

63
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.670
Last time because the radio was broken, I sang to her directly live.

64
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:12.720
Really?
 - Yeah

65
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.530
Which song did you sing?

66
00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.900
"Because I Love You" (singer Yoo Jae-ha)

67
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.260
How did it go? Did you do well?

68
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:27.240
Not really. I just sang it ignoring all the pitch and rhythm etc.

69
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.490
Sing for me too.

70
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.340
I can't sing.

71
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.570
Lies. I know that you sing well, Seonbae.

72
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.860
In the past I did, but I forgot.

73
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.220
Really?

74
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.890
Yeah.

80
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.530
It was light.

81
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:29.060
That's not a compliment you know.

82
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.000
Hurry inside.

83
00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:36.450

It's me Secretary Kang.

93
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.320
What is it?

94
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.340
There.

95
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.960
Oh here.

96
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.600
This is right, right? 
- Yes it is.

97
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.850
This doorlock is the most well-specc'd one in existence.

98
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:17.310
Bio-identification, Indestructible, Motion-sensoring. Directional. Waterproof, Circuit-breaker proof

99
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.620
Even if all the burglars and the strongest ones came as a huge gang, they won't be able to open it.

100
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.760
Yeah Jisoo.

101
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.010
The people who are here won't listen.

102
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.770
You tell them Seonbae to leave.

103
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.920
Until the police come to drag them away, they won't go those people.

104
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.780
Seonbae

105
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:42.390
It's all because of me, not you.

106
00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.800
Because I want to sleep soundly with my legs stretched out.

107
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.670
Now if you're to stay up nights, you need to be sure to eat a lot of good things.

108
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.240
You find me objectionable don't you?

109
00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.110
Pardon?

110
00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.030
It's not work-related, nor family-related.

111
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.710
And all the things others would point fingers at, those are the things I keep having you do.

112
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:05.990
Oh, that.

113
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:10.170
Your body must be tired and your heart must be uncomfortable as well.

114
00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:17.830
Of all the people in the Republic of Korea, I am probably number one for knowing how you've lived, Vice President.

115
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.220
Not Ms. Yoon Ji Soo, not Madame, not Chairman

116
00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.580
but I am the one who knows the most about how you've lived, sir.

117
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.920
I am on your side, sir. I don't ask questions or quibble.

118
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.040
Wow. You've grown a lot!

119
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.010
I am on the tall side, but because I hang around with you.

120
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.270
You know how to kid around, too.

121
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.070
My apologies.

122
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.930
Thanks.

123
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.350
Care Center

124
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:17.290
It's "The Island Baby."

125
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.390
My kid was good at piano.
 All Things Care Facility Family Day.

126
00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.880
What did you say Dad?

127
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.480
My child was good at playing the piano, ma'am.

128
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.320
Good day?

129
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.020
Hello.

130
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.590
What's that?

131
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.980
I didn't think it would fit inside your home.

132
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.340
I also knew you definitely not accept it, so that's why I donated it here.

133
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:55.250
I said that it would also help the patients, so the director agreed.

134
00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.780
I took all of my non-existing imagination to come up with this. So isn't it great?

135
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.120
No, it's not. It's not like it costs a few farthing.

136
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.760
I said to let anyone come and play.

137
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.950
I said that, but I still hoped you'd be the only one playing the whole time.

138
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:16.920
Have a go. Father's memory might come back.

139
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.290
Hey, by the way, are you under investigation with detention or without?

140
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.780
I wouldn't know.

141
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:28.960
What are we doing? Laying down the rhymes? You wanna have a go with me right?

142
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:33.380
Oh. Oh. Arrest and now that even being cornered isn't enough

143
00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.730
You even got sued for an incident from 5 years ago.

144
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:40.550
Can you be so free man? Yeah? Ho.

145
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:44.150
What are you doing? Huh? Geez.

146
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.740
Ah. I see you don't know this.

147
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.270
Yeah. If I don't know should I pray? That I don't get detained?

148
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.370
Well, if you were in your right mind right now, that would mean you were still crazy.

149
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:54.820
I'm doing really well nowadays.

150
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.930
Look at this crazy guy.

151
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.690
Look. He's crazed. Look.

152
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.440
Hey. 
 - What?

153
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.570
When do you get off work?

154
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.290
You wanna drink?

155
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.690
Then let's flex now.

156
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.980
The soundproofing here is good right?

157
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.860
Soundproofing? Why are you asking?

158
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.820
Hey, let me use this room at night.

159
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.340
Wait. Hold up.

160
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.440
So at night. soundproofing?

161
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.390
You with Jisoo?!

162
00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.400
Woah. Your imagination is incredible.

163
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.070
The problem is that it's towards the gutter
 Yo yo yo yo my man.

164
00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.740
Hey be honest. Then I'll let you borrow it, kid.

165
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.010
What did you say? Geez.

166
00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.140
Emergency Medical Services 119

167
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:24.720
Can you make some time for me in the evening?

168
00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:33.190
♫ <i> At night when the stars swim, I hear your voice </i> ♫

169
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:41.870
♫ <i> I want to turn into pollen that breaks away </i> ♫

170
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:49.680
♫ <i> And lands on your flower </i> ♫

171
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:57.360
♫ <i> If you were to leave my side </i> ♫

172
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:05.270
♫ <i> I would follow you to the ends, the very ends my love</i> ♫

173
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:15.700
♫ <i> Come stay in my arms </i> ♫

174
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:24.530
♫ <i> Let's share a dream of love </i> ♫

175
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.480
Jisoo

176
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:38.060
I will go back to you

177
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:45.900
I won't stop. Nor turn back.

178
00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:01.570
During these past few days and now today

179
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.810
I felt like I had become some protagonist in a movie.

180
00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.920
Amongst those days, today was the best scene

181
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:23.000
However as I keep walking alongside you Seonbae, my footsteps grow heavy

182
00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:30.260
The things I had learned from you Seonbae, I cherished in my heart

183
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:35.180
just in case I run into you, so that I won't be ashamed.

184
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.480
For you, and towards anyone, I will walk a path without any shame.

185
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:45.120
I won't deceive anyone anymore.

186
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:52.710
I have some things to organize which is why it might take some time,

187
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.000
but I will return to you.

188
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.710
Deputy Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol

189
00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.970
The sun just rose and everyone is so busy.

190
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.460
- Let's start
 - Yes.

191
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.790
That kid Jae Hyeon, to what extent does he plan on increasing the stakes?

192
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.650
According to the Deputy Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol, Kang Seung Ho

193
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.080
under the auspices of Real Name Financial Law, violation of both Free Market Laws and Payment of National Taxes

194
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.050
is what the warrant was issued under.

195
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.130
Aside from the false-name accounts,

196
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.600
even the slush funds are probably

197
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.650
Wait. How did that kid know even about that?

198
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.910
I believe he was preparing since his time at the planning and development board.

199
00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:31.980
That's why at that time I had wanted him to--!!

200
00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.450
If it weren't for Seo Gyeong, I would have

201
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.870
It is certain that the one who leaked the false-name accounts to the press is him

202
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:48.280
and though I told him to go to jail.

203
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.980
Yet he prepared to pay taxes means that he intends on swallowing those shares.

204
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.890
means that he intends on swallowing those shares.

205
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.780
I'm sorry.

206
00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.860
The best attack is the best defense.

207
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.040
A fight means to win by taking down the opponent.

208
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.510
Enduring and holding on is not how it's won.

209
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.530
Find a fighting ring

210
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.740
one not where he lies await, but

211
00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.250
one where we can summon him.

212
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:29.000
there is a place that he puts in a lot of effort.

213
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.880
<i>Days of Being Wild</i>

214
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:12.600
Because you watch Love Letter or only this movie

215
00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:14.990
I watched it once.

216
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.360
But it wasn't fun. Days of Being Wild.

217
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:28.240
So I plan on getting rid of this room.

218
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.720
Whether it will be a dressing room, or a wine bar I'm debating.

219
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:40.650
I think it's because you keep reminiscing down memory lane here is why we've come the way we have.

220
00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.370
Since before I met Jisoo

221
00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.050
our marriage was over.

222
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.150
I was indifferent and you met another man.

223
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.780
When my fight with Father-in-Law finishes

224
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.850
only one person will pay the price.

225
00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.140
Whether it be me or Father,

226
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.570
it'll be hard for you to endure.

227
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:15.380
It's all in the past. Must you go this far?

228
00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:21.680
Being thrown away after being used is an order that was already planned for a human like me.

229
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:29.030
No part anywhere in this fight is your responsibility.

230
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:32.510
Yet you will get hurt.

231
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:35.780
So what is the best thing I can do for you,

232
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.520
I'm ruminating on it.

233
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:44.100
There's only one thing I want.

234
00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:51.360
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can divorce you. 
 (In Korea BOTH parties must agree to divorce)

235
00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:59.370
I am crying like this, so that woman must also.

236
00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:05.950
If if I don't have love, she shouldn't have any.

237
00:24:09.330 --> 00:24:11.700
It might seem monstrous,

238
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:16.630
but my love is still love, too.

239
00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:35.680
You are Ms. Yoon Jisoo, right?

240
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.560
What is it?

241
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.570
Could you give me some time?

242
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.730
Our chairman hopes to meet with you.

243
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.760
Chairman?

244
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.780
You look very much alike

245
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.250
What are you talking about?

246
00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:05.510
Prosecutor General Yoon Hyeong Gu's only remaining child

247
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.900
his dearest child.

248
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:17.620
The world is quite small Ms. Yoon Jisoo.

249
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.940
Have you ever heard about me from your father?

250
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:28.120
Before that incident we were a relationship without barriers

251
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:33.900
Did you know your father wanted to get into politics?

252
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:39.160
Politicians need money and a corporation needs the networking relations of the prosecutor's office

253
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.650
so we often hung out, drank, and went golfing.

254
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:49.230
His daughter went to Seoul National University, so he was always so proud

255
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:51.470
Is that you, Jisoo?

256
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.880
I don't think you called me to reminisce about old times.

257
00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:03.080
You might misunderstand because I'm smiling as I speak

258
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.630
but i'm not a face that always smiles.

259
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.280
If it weren't for that incident, he would have been great at politics

260
00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.640
becoming a national assemblyman and even prime minister

261
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.910
but why is that such a respected person's daughter seeing my son-in-law?

262
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.460
Do you perhaps need money?

263
00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:33.080
Then tell me. Because of my relationship with your father

264
00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:36.280
I can give you some, with no strings attached.

265
00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:45.550
I told even my son-in-law multiple times

266
00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:48.430
if it concerns my kid

267
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:52.730
I can't control my temper.

268
00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.460
It's a warning if we call it one.

269
00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:01.080
So I hope that you act wisely.

270
00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.510
I report the Murderous Hyeong Seong Corporation's misdeeds! Shameless Chairman Jang family repent!

271
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.270
Since when has he been like that?

272
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.090
Pardon? Whom?

273
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.760
The guy who Lee Se Hoon is representing in the lawfuit.

274
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:46.040
Ah that man, it was a bit before you sir were imprisoned, so it's a bit over 4 years.

275
00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.200
And also the person who had thrown eggs at you, is also him.

276
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:54.960
I report the Murderous Hyeong Seong Corporation's misdeeds! Shameless Chairman Jang family repent!

277
00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.530
Sir? The prosecution that you asked about earlier, I looked into it.

278
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.870
Did you know he was that fellow's father?

279
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:05.900
That fellow?

280
00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.030
Kwon Hyeok Su.

281
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.910
Ah. Kwon Hyeok Su.

282
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:23.780
If you come here without an appointment, it makes us uncomfortable.

283
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:29.180
Last year's labor negotiations, we agreed on an increase on 20% base pay and 50% increase on bonus pay

284
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.220
and that 50% of the subcontracted workers will become regular employees.

285
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.950
It has all been agreed upon. Now a year later, none of that has been kept.

286
00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:38.810
We didn't even start this year's negotiations.

287
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.390
I had time and time again asked for a meeting. Yet there was no response so

288
00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.770
No answer is the response, but you keep asking for--

289
00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.860
In the agreement there were stipulations about implementation

290
00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.680
that if the finances of the corporation become difficult the agreed upon terms become null?

291
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.380
Listen, without properly investigating supply the investment itself

292
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:57.680
into the Australian steel business was a strain itself then the corporation was in straits.

293
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.100
Then that was our fault?

294
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:03.380
When that was being decided upon you had never consulted us once.

295
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.190
Decisions based on investment are the sole responsibility of management

296
00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:09.070
not something to be negotiated on with labor.

297
00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.460
You people make the decisions, yet want us to take responsibility?

298
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.700
It is because of steel that the entire corporate holding group is in a difficult position.

299
00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.710
At this point the best we can do is to wait and endure until the shipbuilding and construction do better.

300
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:24.300
The joy is relished last while we are the first to burden difficulties.

301
00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.090
Is that the management philosophy of Hyeong Seong?

302
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.320
Think what you wish.

303
00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.340
The "enduring" that you speak of so easily

304
00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.610
is a matter of life and death to us.

305
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:48.270
Since it's a matter of survival, you should decide for yourself all the more. Before someone else decides for you.

306
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:52.210
Han Jae Hyeon was the Hyeong Seong Group's strategics chief at the time.

307
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:57.100
From what I gather, right after Hyeok Soo met with Han Jae Hyeon

308
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.920
he ruptured the labor and management negotiation and resolved to a general strike.

309
00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.270
But the strike didn't quite last a day.

310
00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.600
It didn't...

311
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.900
My conclusion as of now is that Hyeok Soo was used by the company.

312
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.320
was used by the company.

313
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.440
What?

314
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.620
The reason they ceased the strike was that Hyeok Soo brought a new offer from the company.

315
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:23.720
They offered to increase pay and accept other demands.

316
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.210
They persuaded the union members with that

317
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:31.800
to end the strike and drop all the charges and suits against the management.

318
00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.940
Afterwards, the company changed their stance.

319
00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:42.400
The strike leaders all underwent structural lay offs and even simple participants

320
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.390
were scattered and sent to other subsidiaries.

321
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.250
Hyeok Soo was the only one who stayed in the same position during that process.

322
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.250
He was even promoted to operations manager,

323
00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:03.010
but we don't know how those who stayed and left treated Hyeok Soo.

324
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.750
Our Hyeok Soo... I feel so bad for him.

325
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.780
We need to make them pay.

326
00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:18.340
The person who played the biggest role in this tragedy.

327
00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.220
Yeong Min, is everything alright with you?

328
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.680
Yes.

329
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.790
Then why did your grades drop?

330
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.200
I'm sorry.

331
00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.800
If you're sorry, work harder.

332
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.170
Yes.

333
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.700
Do you want to go study abroad, Yeong Min?

334
00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:38.830
Abroad?

335
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.440
A company that does a lot of good deeds

336
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.800
has a program where they send students with good grades to study abroad.

337
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.150
You got picked this time.

338
00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.730
But my grades dropped a lot.

339
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:52.350
It has nothing to do with your grade–

340
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.100
You did well before.

341
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.940
Doesn't it cost a lot of money?

342
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.390
All you have to do is say you want to go–

343
00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.800
It doesn't cost money.

344
00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.780
The company will pay for your tuition and all living costs.

345
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:17.730
Hi, Yeong Min.

346
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:22.100
Mom. I got chosen as a study abroad scholarship student!

347
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.960
Study abroad?

348
00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.840
It's a scholarship from Hyeong Seong.

349
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.000
It's like a Hyeong Seong scholarship program. It will be advantageous for getting a job there later, too.

350
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.320
Isn't that kind of thing for college students, though?

351
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.040
It is. I was really surprised when I heard Yeong Min got chosen, too.

352
00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.980
But it means that Yeong Min is that exceptional, right?

353
00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.200
I see.

354
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.020
I can tell you more in detail if you come by this weekend.

355
00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.600
Okay.

356
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.900
I gained.

357
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:56.890
Share some information.

358
00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.300
Is the rumor true?

359
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.580
No, it's not true.

360
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:24.770
I know, right?

361
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:34.160
Yeong Min.

362
00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:38.310
I have a bit of a bad aftertaste.

363
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.060
About what?

364
00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.460
Being a Hyeong Seong scholarship recipient.

365
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.630
Why?

366
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.400
There's no such thing as free food in this world, except for mom's food.

367
00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:56.090
If you eat outside of the home, you naturally have to pay.

368
00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.500
That's why if I receive something too big, whether it's feelings or objects,

369
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:06.550
I start to worry about how I'm going to repay them.

370
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:12.540
I worry that you're going to get indigestion after eating because you're worried about the price of the food.

371
00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:17.830
Are you disappointed?

372
00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:22.970
A little, but I had a feeling I couldn't go.

373
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:24.210
Why?

374
00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.760
Because I can't take you with me.

375
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.420
Why would you take me with you? You go alone to places like that.

376
00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.160
I'm stuck to you like glue.

377
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:53.510
- Dad, let's go home now. 
 -Yeah?

378
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.040
Okay.

379
00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:07.000
Aren't you cold?

380
00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.250
I was really cold.

381
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:16.610
When I'm out on the streets for the strike

382
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:21.980
I feel so cold no matter how many layers I wear.

383
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.500
My son did not commit suicide.

384
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.430
The company and Vice President Han Jae Hyeon made him die.

385
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:53.300
According to Mr. Kwon, the father of the chief exectuive of the Hyeong Seong Steel Industry's labor union who passed away 5 years ago,

386
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.350
Han Jae Hyeon, who was the strategy planning chief at the time...

387
00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:01.780
<i> I report the brutality of the murderous company, Hyeong Seong! </i>

388
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.400
Are you wanting to confirm? I can confirm for you

389
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:18.700
all the things Han Jae Hyeon did.

390
00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.050
If what you're saying is true, he'll receive the appropriate legal judgment he deserves.

391
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:24.050
I'm not going to blindly take his side.

392
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:28.370
I'd like to see if you'll still be able to say that later on.

393
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.690
Are you targeting Seonbae because of me?

394
00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:36.180
Han Jae Hyeon was at the heart of that case.

395
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.180
He was the one in charge of all the decisions regarding the labor union at that time.

396
00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:46.710
To be honest, I did start because of you.

397
00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:52.010
But now, I've become interested in Han Jae Hyeon himself.

398
00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:58.170
There are a lot of stories aside from that man.

399
00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.560
The genre is close to Noir.

400
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.480
Did you anticipate the dismissal of the arrest warrant?

401
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.320
Are the borrowed-name stocks really yours?

402
00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.690
What are your thoughts on the allegations of slush funds?

403
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:14.030
Is there anything you would like to say?

404
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.460
How are you feeling about this?

405
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.670
Why, why, why are you wanting to drink at a place like this? Are you really poor?

406
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:28.010
I came a few days ago and really liked it. It feels better than drinking at a hotel and costs less.

407
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:32.900
Then at least order some eel or chicken gizzard!

408
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.140
This is so lame. I get off the sides more than the alcohol.

409
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:39.610
Okay, okay, I'll set up a buffet for you. An entire buffet.

410
00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:41.800
Alright!

411
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.800
-Ajumma! 
 -Bring us a buffet!

412
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:54.650
I wonder if time is to blame for what's happening to us now.

413
00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.700
We didn't have to study as hard as now.

414
00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:05.240
We didn't have to go on crazy strikes like in the 80's.

415
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:10.900
There were so many good movies, books, and songs.

416
00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:15.360
Exactly. No matter how much I think about it

417
00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.370
those were some good times.

418
00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:24.600
But those were some insanely cruel times, too.

419
00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.690
A lot of good people were lost.

420
00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:32.430
And good people became bad people.

421
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Hello?

422
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.990
I'm Kim Mi Hwa. Do you remember me?

423
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:59.580
Yes, Unni. Hello, are you doing well?

424
00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:02.400
I'm doing well. How about you?

425
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.180
I'm doing well, too. But did you need something?

426
00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:10.120
We heard from Seon Hee. Can you play the keyboard for us, too?

427
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.740
The keyboard?

428
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:17.100
We have a separate market labor union and we're doing a culture festival, too.

429
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:22.510
Of course I'll go. I'm part of the family, too.

430
00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.800
I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

431
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.700
Jae Hyeon.

432
00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.080
Sunbae, get up.

433
00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:10.830
You're here?

434
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.100
Why much did you drink?

435
00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.490
Dong Jin keeps seducing me too, that Dong Jin.

436
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:24.380
Why would you come here? You should've gone home.

437
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.500
The road home was too difficult.

438
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.670
It bothers me that the elder who used to always protest isn't at his usual spot anymore,

439
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:38.710
and that his son died so unfairly.

440
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.770
I think about my mother, too,

441
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.890
and her stupid son.

442
00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:54.480
I think about Seo Kyeong,

443
00:40:57.060 --> 00:40:59.780
and Joon Seo.

444
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.150
And Ji Soo...

445
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:12.380
and Young Min.

446
00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:17.730
I promised to go to you,

447
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:22.760
but things keep holding my feet on my way to you.

448
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:26.770
It's because I live in a harsh place.

449
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.460
Its a bumpy and difficult stony path

450
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:39.880
so it's really difficult to come to me.

451
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:53.430
Why is it that your lashes still so pretty?

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.760
Where's Secretary Kang's number...

455
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.240
This is not a person, but a carpet.

456
00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:34.560
This isn't me offering him any ramen, but an unavoidable situation.

457
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.950

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:24.100
Right? It did seem like there was something between them that day.

473
00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.140
That day?

474
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.930
I mean, when they were here on the weekend,

475
00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.150
the way they looked at each other was something else.

476
00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:34.120
They did that even at school?

477
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.200
They're so bold.

478
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:43.700
Yes?

479
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.820
It's Secretary Kang!

480
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:58.640
I didn't even get to properly greet you earlier.

481
00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.460
You're looking good!

482
00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.780
- Really? 
 - Yea.

483
00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.250
Are you dating someone? How did your face brighten up so much? Is it botox?

484
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.160
What do you mean, botox? She was always pretty.

485
00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:12.210
Earlier, when she was playing the keyboard, she looks so sophisticated and pretty.

486
00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:16.320
It's all because your face suits that, and your fingers are so slender too.

487
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:21.560
I used to play when I was younger,  but I had to quit because I kept hitting the keys  in twos.

488
00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.530
Just head on out now.

489
00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.590
Why did the lights go off now?

490

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.130
This was such a great pick!

495
00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:19.000
The strawberries are so good.

496
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.740
Let me try some.

497
00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.880
It's so good!

498
00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:01.930
What a relief that my birthday and his visit day overlaps.

499
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:04.850
What are you doing?

500
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:06.790
You're taking everything.

502
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:09.790
She's probably going to her boyfriend.

503
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.260
Where are you going on your birthday? You should eat with us.

504
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.500
We can eat right now.

505
00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.640
Your father already left for work.

506
00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.900
Then what can I do?

507
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:19.610
Dad wants to eat dinner. That's why we haven't even bought a cake yet.

508
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.130
Dinner doesn't work for me.

509
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.330
You should still try to make it back on time. Should we eat by ourselves when it's your birthday?

510
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:27.610
You're never around otherwise.

511
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.880
Okay, I'll come back as soon as I can.

512
00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.760
What about the cake? Which do you want?

513
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.430
Whichever.

514
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:38.090
I'm going to the department with mom to fix my watch. Should we buy a strawberry cake there?

515
00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.290
Do whatever you want.

516
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:41.180
Come back soon! Else your father will get angry.

517
00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:42.200
Okay!

518
00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.220
Look at her, leaving without even properly showing us her face.

519
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.800
Unni, your face will tan!

520
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.450
This cake is great.

521
00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:51.700
This cake.

522
00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:53.790
Delicious.

523
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:58.520
Young Min, why aren't you eating the cake?

524
00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.150
Oh, that's...

525
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.390
Why? Does it not taste good?

526
00:50:03.390 --> 00:50:04.710
I'm just so full.

527
00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:08.830
You don't look too good. Are you feeling sick?

528
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.640
No, I'm fine.

529
00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:15.340
Shall we pack some for you to take home? It's a birthday cake, it's meant to be shared.

530
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.060
Package it.

Why are you riding the train?

546
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:25.200
It may seem like a lie, but Secretary Kang is on vacation.

547
00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.800
Then you could just drive.

548
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.820
This may seem like a bigger lie, but my car's undergoing routine maintenance.

How did you know I would get on this one?

550
00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:37.310
Well, I've been waiting at the station since dawn.

551
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:41.200
Why would you do that?

552
00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.730
I just wanted to.

553
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:47.780
You're at home alone, you eat alone,

554
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:54.050
and you always ride the train alone. Those things kinda tugged at me.

555
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:58.830
Why am I alone? I have my dad and Young Min.
