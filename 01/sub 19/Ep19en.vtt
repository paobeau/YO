00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.180
(Previously on Episode 18)
There's not a single person I can't locate.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.860
Then why did you disappear
and disconnect from her?

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.860
I think I'm the one who couldn't
get in touch with her.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.380
Why do you bring me here?

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.300
We haven't broken up.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:05.220
(Episode 19: When the enemy is quiet, I'm quiet.
When the enemy moves, I take actions.)

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.180
Hello!

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
Haicheng?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
I was planning to visit Haicheng.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.980
I didn't know Lu was going

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.580
to have a sketching there during the holiday.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.300
What are the odds?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.060
Didn't Zhou Xiao

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.220
tell you about it?

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:49.380
Hey.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.100
I'm not stalking Lu.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.900
I planned this trip a month ago.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.420
I've bought the ticket.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.540
I have the reservation message.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
If you don't believe me,
I can show it to you.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.180
What are you doing?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.700
Show it to me.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.700
It's ridiculous.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.500
Why should I?

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:16.340
Hey,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.100
Lu will think I'm stalking her whatever

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.300
won't she?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.740
Yes.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.740
How about this?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.260
Fanzhou,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.140
you and Zhou Xiao go with me.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.780
This way, Lu won't have any doubts.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.300
No.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.380
Why?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.740
Hey,

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.540
do you know how dangerous it is for a girl

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.540
to spend sketching holiday all by herself?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.820
Lu

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.100
is Zhou Xiao's roommate.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.460
You're Zhou Xiao's boyfriend.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.340
Don't you think you should do something here?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.780
You're so indifferent to your schoolmate.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.300
What does Zhou Xiao see in you?

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.980
Hello?

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.780
How about we go to Haicheng with Lu
for her sketching holiday?

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.500
It's right on my way home.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.140
I'm going to the supermarket

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.660
to buy some snacks for the trip.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.900
I'll be waiting at the supermarket.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.100
Xie Yixing.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.660
What's up?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:42.380
We'll go to Haicheng.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.540
What did you say?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.620
Can you repeat it? I didn't get it.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.300
Where are we going?

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.580
Haicheng.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.060
I thought you didn't want to go there.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.740
Alright.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.780
No problem.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.780
I'll rent the car.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.780
The trip only takes two hours.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.900
Why do you buy two of them?

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.020
One is for Lu.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:11.340
I see.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.900
Do you want some jelly?

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.180
OK. OK. We'll take it.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.020
Which one?

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.020
All of them.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.820
Oh.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.300
I like it!

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.500
What?

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.940
Xiao, put the basket here.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.540
You're here.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.380
You buy so many things.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.220
Can you finish them all?

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.260
Of course.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.580
I feel like I'm rolling.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.220
Ah?

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.820
I'm the third wheel here.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.300
Give it to me.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.140
Snacks are on me.

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.300
Take whatever you want.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.180
Keep your word.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.660
I want that.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:54.700
Just take it.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.380
Do you want this?

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.260
Yep.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.420
Cai Yasi.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.820
Cai Yasi.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.700
The vacation is around the corner.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.020
Why do you buy so many instant noodles?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.500
They're on discount because of the vacation.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.380
I'd stock up on it.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.100
You're a rich guy.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.060
You...

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.380
You don't get it.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.780
Cai Yasi

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.260
wants to use his money well.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.100
You haven't visited his place.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.780
He has this USB flash drive

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.700
which costs several thousand yuan.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.260
And his most expensive game skin

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.260
costs more than a thousand yuan.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.860
What about you?

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.180
What brings you here?

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.980
We're going to Haicheng for a trip.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.620
How about you go with us?

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.380
Are you in or not?

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.820
Both Lu and Xie Yixing are in.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.700
After the trip,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:42.980
we three can get back home together.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.260
Don't bother asking.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.220
He won't participate in any activities

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.540
that cost money.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:51.580
I'm in.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.220
That's great!

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.980
Finally, I don't have to be the only third wheel.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.060
Wow!

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.260
Who owns this car?

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.180
It's so cool.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.740
Of course it's me.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.580
Who else could it be?

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:09.500
Fanzhou,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.460
take it.

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.900
That's your car.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:13.100
Get in the car.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:13.660
Let's go.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.620
Let's go.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.380
You get in the car first.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.180
I'll settle the luggage.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.620
OK.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.180
Bye.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.540
Bye.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.700
Xie Yixing,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.100
here is my luggage.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.660
There is no room in the car.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.500
You can get on that car.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.300
So, what do you think?

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.500
It's a cool car, isn't it?

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.540
Not too bad.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.580
Look at the interior.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.700
It's so delicate.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.540
Let's fasten our safety belts.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:44.980
Thank you.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.380
We all know what Xie Yixing is trying to do.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:13.860
Hey.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:14.860
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.700
The car

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.500
is locked.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:27.300
It's so childish.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.860
Let's go.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.420
Let's go.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.380
Let's go.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.140
Zhou Xiao,

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.660
fasten your safety belt.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.180
Oh, that's right.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.620
It's so exciting!

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.860
Slow down.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.140
The one in the backseat,
please fasten your safety belt.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.380
Keep your eyes on the road.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.460
I'm looking

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.060
in the rear view mirror on your side.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.700
How about we listen to music?

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.820
I've been waiting to hear that.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.820
I've downloaded so many songs.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.300
Let me show you

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:20.980
my good taste in music.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:21.980
OK.

The sea!

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.380
Hey,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.540
wait for me.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.620
Zhou Xiao.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.500
Here we are.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.500
Wow, the sunshine is so strong.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.660
Where is Cai Yasi?

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.300
They've got out of the car.

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:35.580
He forgot his backpack on the car.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.020
He is so careless.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:42.700
What's up?

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.180
Why did you...

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:03.300
Let's go.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.780
Your backpack.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:25.940
What took you so long?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.820
Where are they?

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:29.860
They went to the sea.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.860
Here are your identity cards

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:34.300
and room card.

00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.020
Your room is on the second floor.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.260
I'm not sharing a room with him.

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:43.140
I want to share a room with Lu and Ling.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:47.420
Your room card

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:49.420
is here.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:52.980
What were you thinking?

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.620
I'm sorry, Zhou Xiao.

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.140
I only

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.140
get two rooms for us.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.500
One for boys, one for girls.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.300
If you have some other plans,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.380
you two can discuss it privately.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.180
I don't have to know about it.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.900
What are you talking about?

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.020
What's so funny?

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.220
It's Cai Yasi's backpack.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.620
Would you also bring my luggage to the room?

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.460
Thanks.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:25.140
I'll help her.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.100
OK.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:36.100
Finally, we're here.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.900
Your luggage is already here.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:52.860
Lu, where are you?

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:53.980
When will you come back?

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.780
What's up?

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.340
(Cai Yasi)

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.340
Let me check it.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.020
Nope.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.100
I need to take it.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:26.660
Nope.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.620
Zhou Xiao,

00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:32.260
Xie Yixing asks us to meet at the terrace.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.500
What took you so long?

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.580
I opened the door immediately, OK?

00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.380
Let's go.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.140
The sea!

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:02.300
Yeh!

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.780
Why don't you join me yelling?

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:07.420
Where is Lu?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.140
Lu? She is drawing.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.020
Who knows what Xie Yixing has planned?

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.500
What are you doing?

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:18.780
I'm gonna tell Lu my feelings for her.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.140
Come on.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:20.860
Ah?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.820
What?

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.340
You guys don't know

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.180
I like her?

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.140
I mean,

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.660
why do you choose tomorrow?

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:28.380
It's kinda out of the blue.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.140
Well, there's no time like the present.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:31.980
Besides,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.860
I'm gonna need some help

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:34.780
for this great plan.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.780
Tomorrow, as soon as you hear my whistle,

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:41.140
you guys fly the kite into the sky.

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:42.540
You gotta help me.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.580
So these are the kites
you're gonna use for you plan?

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.500
Are they gonna work?

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.540
Not these.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.380
These ones are for rehearsal.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:53.620
Is there even a rehearsal for flying a kite?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.700
You'll understand tomorrow

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.460
when you see

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.260
the beautiful, custom-made kite I booked.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.820
Why should we help you?

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.740
Well, we're on this trip together.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.340
Besides, it's fun to fly a kite.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:11.820
Don't you think so, Fanzhou?

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:14.900
No, I don't think so.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.820
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:17.460
look!

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.580
It's so fun to fly the kite!

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.060
Let's get started.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.500
Come on.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.020
I don't know how to do it.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.500
I just don't.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:34.500
Yes, you do.

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.380
You definitely do. Come on.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.460
Let out the string.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.340
Why is it so easy for you?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.300
Wow,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.620
it's so delicious!

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.980
Zhao Fanzhou, you're so good at it!

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:07.780
Don't eat too much.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.500
I've been drawing all this afternoon.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.740
I'm exhausted. Save some for me.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.580
Let me have a taste.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.900
There is chopped scallion on it.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:21.540
Your boyfriend is so good at it.

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.540
Sure.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.460
He is my boyfriend, after all.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.420
It's just barbecue.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.460
What's the big deal about it?

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:13.340
Come on, taste it. It's just off the grill.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.780
What is it?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.260
It's too big for me.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.300
Have a try.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.980
Finally, you're here. Let's get started.

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.580
OK.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.500
Well done.

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.500
I'm back.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.700
Barbecue and beer

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.580
always pair well together. Come on.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.180
So many bottles of liquor!

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.740
What if we get drunk?

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.180
Don't take me for granted.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.860
I'm a heavy weight.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:48.860
Cheers!

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.900
-Cheers! -Cheers!

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.100
Zhao Fanzhou.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.540
Cheers!

00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.300
Come on.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.020
Lie down here.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:01.900
Today, let's get drunk.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.300
Let's get drunk.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:04.660
Are you alright?

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.700
How come they are so drunk?

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.860
These three boys don't get credit

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:14.940
for their drinking capacity.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.460
I know Cai Yasi

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.220
is a light weight.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:20.060
How come Zhao Fanzhou
can't hold his liquor at all?

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.100
I have no idea.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.900
And why did they start this drinking game?

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.420
I don't know.

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:30.980
Are you alright?

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.620
Slowly. Slowly.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.100
They shouldn't drink so much.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:44.940
Let's leave them here.

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.140
I can barely keep my eyes open.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.860
-Are you OK? -Let's go.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:50.540
Are you OK?

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.100
Alright.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.060
Slowly. Slowly.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:53.500
Let's go.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:56.660
Just lie in bed.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.140
No, no, no. He is still in the bathroom.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.100
He is in the bathroom.

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:08.860
The bed is ruined.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.540
You need to find him another room.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.740
What are you doing?

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:20.580
I'm not done yet.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.340
No way.

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:23.620
Excuse me,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:26.700
I want a room.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:28.940
OK. I'll check it for you.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.300
OK.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:30.980
Stand straight.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.900
Miss, I'm afraid

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.180
we only have one standard room left.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.780
Is it OK for you?

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:36.660
OK. OK.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.180
OK.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.100
Stand straight.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:41.260
Miss, it seems your boyfriend

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.380
is really drunk.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.420
Please don't let him lie on his back

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.820
in case he gets chocked

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:46.740
by the vomit flowed into his trachea.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.180
Do you hear that?

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.820
Miss, here is your room card.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.540
OK.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.100
Thanks.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.860
You're welcome.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.660
Let's go.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:58.900
Stop.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:03.540
Wait a moment.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:05.940
Go!

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.140
Go!

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.780
Give me your hand.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.020
Your hand. Your hand.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.060
How about

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.260
later?

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.420
Nope.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.540
Nope.

00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.380
It's stuck.

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.260
I don't care.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.100
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.060
is this how you look like when you get drunk?

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.300
I want to hold your right hand.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:47.060
Left hand.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:21:59.980
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.460
are you faking it?

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.060
I'm not drunk.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.220
I can even help you

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:11.780
push...

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.460
See? I'm pushing the cart for you.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.500
Let's go.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.180
Go. Go.

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.180
Go. Go.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:22.900
It's stuck.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.700
You're such a light weight.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.180
It's so hilarious.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.660
I said,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.300
I'm

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.140
not

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:50.900
drunk.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:12.700
I'm

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:13.460
not

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.380
drunk.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:18.940
I'm not drunk.

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.420
Here we are. Here we are.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.220
Get up for a moment.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:59.900
Why?

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:01.220
Get up and have some water.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:02.500
Come on.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:03.620
Have some water.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.500
Lie down.

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.060
Zhao Fanzhou,

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.740
I'm leaving.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:41.500
Call me if you need anything.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:53.140
Where is the room card?

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.180
Pick up the phone.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.100
Just pick up the phone.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.940
Please don't let him lie on his back

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:16.260
in case he gets chocked
by the vomit flowed into his trachea.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.740
Do you feel better?

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:26.860
Yes.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:34.820
Let me tuck you in.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.300
Otherwise you might catch a cold.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.700
What is he doing?

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.540
Is he

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.860
gonna...

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.060
No way.

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.660
Zhou Xiao, what are you thinking?

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.180
You're awake?

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:53.540
What are you doing?

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.380
I'm getting back to my room.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.500
Put on some clothes.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.540
Otherwise you might catch a cold.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:05.780
Don't move.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:09.380
Go and take a shower.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.220
You have barbecue sauce on your hair.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.020
I'll take a shower in my room.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:30.220
What's up?

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:33.780
I can't find my room card.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:36.660
You can take a shower here.

00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:38.140
I'll put on some clothes

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.100
and get you a room card at the front desk.

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:56.820
Zhou Xiao, calm down.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.660
It's just a shower.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.220
It's no big deal.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:34.940
Zhou Xiao.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:41.980
Zhou Xiao.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.020
What's up?

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.820
Do you have your identity card with you?

00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:49.740
The receptionist said

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.540
your identity card is required

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.060
to issue a new room card.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:53.460
Ah?

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:55.700
But I left it in my room.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.540
Ah?

00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.180
What then?

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.580
How about you get out of the bathroom first?

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.820
Alright, in a minute.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:18.060
What's up?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.620
Wait a moment. It's alright.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:22.020
I'm not ready yet.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.500
Oh.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.020
I'm ready now.

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:49.380
OK.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:54.220
Without your identity card,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.220
we have to...

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.380
Good night.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.620
What are you doing?

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:30.020
When the enemy is quiet, I'm quiet.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.460
When the enemy moves, I take actions.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.380
I'm just turning out the light.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:35.300
Why do you turn out the light?

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:36.740
To get to sleep.

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:37.460
We don't sleep.

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.460
Then what do we do now?

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:40.980
I...

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.740
TV.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:47.740
I want to watch TV.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.740
Is this nurse a psycho?

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:08.620
Yes.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.700
Do you feel afraid?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.460
I'm OK.

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.020
Well, I've watched it for a while,

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.980
but I don't understand
what the film is about.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:28.460
It's about what happened

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.860
between the writer and this nurse
who rescued him,

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.340
which is thrilling and criminal.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.300
Oh, I see.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.340
If it frightens you,

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.020
we can stop watching it.

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.820
Though it freaks me out,

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.380
I'd like to finish watching it.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:19.300
Do you feel better this way?

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.500
Yes.

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.740
A writer tortured by his stalking fan?

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.380
There is so much tension in this story.

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.380
Maybe I'll create a crazy fan

00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.540
for my lead character as well.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:07.620
OK.

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.700
It's over.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.460
Let's go to sleep.

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:26.820
You...

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:30.100
How about you go back to your bed?

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:32.140
I'm so sleepy.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.700
Let's get some sleep.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.620
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:42.660
Do you feel

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.100
it's a little bit crowded here?

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:04.220
Are you mad?

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.180
No. Let's go to sleep.

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.260
I think you are.

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.420
No.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:17.420
Actually, you don't have to be afraid of me.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.540
Without your permission,

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.500
I won't do anything improper.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.500
I know.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:29.260
You better do.

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.260
I just do.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.780
Well, you don't have to
challenge me like that.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.140
You're noisy. Just go to sleep.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:58.900
Good night.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:00.220
Good night.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.060
Zhou Xiao?

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.620
Zhou Xiao?

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.620
You're really asleep.

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.300
How did you sleep last night?

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.660
I slept so well.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.660
Well, I didn't.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:15.860
Why?

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:20.580
I had a dream about you.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:23.660
What happened in your dream?

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.900
My hair!

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:31.820
Let me clean it up for you.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:35.300
That's what I dreamed about last night.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:54.940
Hello?

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.540
Hello?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:57.300
Did you get up?

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.140
I'm awake.

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.900
See you at the terrace in 20 minutes.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.380
I'm

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.500
counting on you.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.100
OK.

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:10.940
Who is it?

00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:12.420
Xie Yixing asks us to meet him

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:14.100
at the terrace in 20 minutes.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:15.620
We need to hurry up.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:16.540
Let's go.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:19.140
The watch.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.140
Why do you bring me here?

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.260
I have something to tell you.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.780
What is it?

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.380
You'll see in a minute.

00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.980
Just be patient.

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.420
(Beautiful Lu, I only love you.)

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.020
Don't you

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.340
like it?

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.780
Yes, I do.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:16.100
How about me?

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.700
What did you just say?

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:22.820
I like you.

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.340
Could you like me back?

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:37.420
Yes.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.780

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:54.300

♪Loving you.♪

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.820
Someone didn't come back last night.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:14.420
Well,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.100
that's because Zhao Fanzhou was drunk.
