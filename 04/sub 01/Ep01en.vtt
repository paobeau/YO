Seasonable weather for crop raising.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.000
Capital City
Seasonable weather for crop raising.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.060
Capital City

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.460
Dear listeners,
Capital City

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.020
Dear listeners,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.500
In this chapter, we'll talk about

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.820
the stories of a legendary girl

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.780
who's opposed to arranged marriage,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.020
and traveled a long way to the capital city to escape from it.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.500
That day, the scorching sun was directly overhead.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.660
With the vernal breeze, comes the swift trotting steed.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.700
In that carriage, there was a scholar.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.660
He's from the capital. His name is...

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.020
TANG FEILONG!

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.380
Tang Feilong uttered coldly,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.620
'do you know...'

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.860
MY HEART FALLS FOR YOU!

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.780

She's the most popular story-teller in capital city.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.580
Her series of Tang Feilong's Romance

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.700
wins the heart of millions of girls.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.380
And the character in her story

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.340
is not fictional.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.540
but this charming gentleman on the horseback.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.800
Hanlin gifted Tang Tianyuan!

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.380
Sister, slow down.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.180
We will always be your fans!

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.980
Hurry up.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.260
Prince charming Mr. Tang!

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.580
Protect us all along!

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.100
Tang Tianyuan! Tang Tianyuan! Tang Tianyuan!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.380
Tang Tianyuan! Tang Tianyuan!

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.860
Love Is All

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.300
Episode 01
Miaomiaosheng's start-up bookstore opens
Tang Tianyuan travels a long way to Tongling

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.980
The highest goodness
is like water.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.900
Tang Tianyuan
Most popular guy in the capital
No girls won't chase after him
He can only use a fan to hide his face
The highest goodness
is like water.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.140
Master! Master!

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.020
Boss.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.500
Your tea house is quite popular.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.780
Why are all your customers girls?

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.780
Zheng Shaofeng
primus of military exam

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.620
Let me explain it to you.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500
Of this whole city, the stories told by our narrator

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.820
are the most popular ones among girls.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.060
What would you like for the tea?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.300
Zucchini

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.860
Give our master a new pot of tea.
Zucchini

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.019
Zucchini

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.419
That's it.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.300
Sure. Please wait a minute.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.420
I've tried all the tea houses in the whole city with you.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.500
When can you break the habit of

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.460
listening to stories?

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.060
I heard among all the story-tellers

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.660
he's the most popular in this city. I can't miss this.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.140
No one is as popular as you.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.940
Just for a look of Mr. Tang,

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.300
girls come here from everywhere.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.340
Who's Mantis?

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.300
The girls nowadays are so annoying.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.620
Which girl

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.500
broke your heart?

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.460
The other day

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.940
a girl falls on my horse.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.060
I think that's God Blessed.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.580
That's how a sweet love story is supposed to start.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.980
Master! Master! Master!

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.500
It begins.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.780
Master! Master!

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.940
Master! Master! Master!

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.900
Master! Master! Master!

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.100
Recap of previous chapter: Tang Feilong lost lian

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.980
and was ordered by father to report in at Hanlin Academy.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.860
Tang Feilong?

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.540
He didn't expect that halfway there,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.220
a girl fell from the heaven.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.180
Isn't this the same as what you said?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.860
Make fun of me.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.060
Great honours are great burdens

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.980
Of course it was Tang Feilong.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.220
Tang Feilong held her tight.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.860
and took her away riding the horse.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.060
He dares defame me to such extent.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.060
Lian nestled against him coyly,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.660
too bashful to look her loved one in the eye.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.900
Where's Mr. Tang?

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.780
- Who's that? - No idea.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.180
The Tang Feilong you're talking about

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.980
is he Tang Tianyuan?

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.140
Where's your manners?

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.940
I'm telling a story.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.140
If you want to interrupt,

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.980
you need to pay first.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.820
So the answer is yes?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.420
I don't want to answer that.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.780
What's he doing?

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.940
Who's he?

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.660
Let's get back to the story.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.380
Boo!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.220
At this moment,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.460
Tang Feilong held Lian firmly with his arms.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.220
So sweet!

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.380
The two looked each other in the eye.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.220
Under the moonlight, the air became sweet

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.820
Don't talk about Tang Feilong anymore.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.620
Get off the stage! Boo! Boo!

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.100
Why?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.340
Boss!

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.180
Stage invasion here!

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.580
Get off the stage! Boo! Boo!

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.220
Master please continue.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.420
You're just telling the story out of pure imaginaton.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.540
It happened under my very eyes.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.300
And you also saw he hold her tight yourself?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.660
I-I can't make a guess on that?

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.660
- What bullshit guess? - Get off the stage.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.020
No.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.980
Stop right there.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.980
Leave if you don't want to listen.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.820
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.340
Get off.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.860
Alright.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:39.980
Get off. Get off.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.260
Seeing that, Lian closed her eyes.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.340
At that very moment,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.300
Tang Feilong was distracted by something else.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.860
Why?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.420
You guys might be wondering

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.300
if Tang Feilong is some kind of priest or saint.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.500
Is he a playboy?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.780
Actually not.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:05.100
It's because he found that Lian...

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:07.620
He found that Lian...

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.980
What is it?

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.380
What happened? What is it?

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.860
He found that Lian

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.260
had no legs!

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.140
She's a girl?

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.380
Embroidered shoes. Embroidered shoes.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:19.820
Shit.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.540
The storyteller is a girl.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.580
I forgot to change shoes.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.620
I haven't finished it yet.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.180
Don't leave.

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.060
Stop it.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.020
The guests are all leaving.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.940
Get down. Get down.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.020
Cross-dressing as a man. Brilliant idea.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.780
Turns out this storyteller is a girl.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:37.340
Mr. Tang. Let's go.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.620
Sir.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.580
Where did that storyteller go?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.860
I just fired her. She left.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.460
Boss.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.340
Shoo!

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.100
I can do a few days for free.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.260
No need. We don't need you.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.260
Why?

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.820
You haven't given me a chance.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.740
Why would you refuse me?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.900
Bro.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:08.900
No. This girl.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.300
All the capital city knows about you.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.540
No one wants a female storyteller.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.540
I suggest you to give it up.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.300
A girl should go back home

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.660
and marry someone.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.140
Don't show your face in the public.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.220
Sister. Forget about that. Let's go.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.580
We just got used to the life here,

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:36.900
but now we have to leave.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:37.940
Sister.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.620
Why don't you

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.460
find a hostel and stay there?

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.060
I'll find more jobs to do

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.900
and provide for you.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:45.820
I'm the elder one.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.060
How can I make you do that?

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.940
I miss the moon-cake mom made.

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:59.300
Me too.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.940
I know where we're going.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.900
Tongling.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.820
Tongling?

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.460
That's where mom was born.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.500
Where mom was born?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.980
The price there must be lower.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.340
But sister,

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.140
you haven't got a chance to talk to Tang Tianyuan.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.580
But we have a life to live.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.420
Although I didn't see his face clearly,

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.700
still I'm content to ride the same horse with him.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.900
That day when he was passing the street,

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:40.740
so many girls were screaming his name.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.220
Tang Tianyuan!

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.180
I want to climb higher to attract his attention.

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.140
Never have I thought...

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:50.100
It was so humiliating.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.380
I didn't get a chance to see his face.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.620
But...

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.100
I've already ridden the same horse with him.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.580
Help!

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.540
Get me off here.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.380
I don't want to go back to Jinan

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.260
and marry Zhu Dacong.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.500
Master. You alright?

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:16.940
Zhu Dacong
son of state administrator of Jinan

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:17.460
I...
Zhu Dacong
son of state administrator of Jinan

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.420
Zhu Dacong
son of state administrator of Jinan

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:19.540
In my dream, my fiancee run away with someone else.
Zhu Dacong
son of state administrator of Jinan

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.940
In my dream, my fiancee run away with someone else.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.420
It gave me a fright. Such a fright.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.180
She did run away.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.100
That's not the same as running away with someone else.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.100
I'll get my fiancee back.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.380
Shut your mouth.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.340
Master.

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.340
We've packed.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:35.940
We're ready to go.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:41.940
I'll search my fiancee to every corner.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.780
And track down the money from Sang Jie.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.660
Hit the road.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.540
Tongling

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.780
Sis. This is mom's hometown.

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.300
Right.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.180
Mom told me when I was young,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.300
\there's a good store for mooncake here.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.900
Why haven't I heard of that?

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.100
You were not born yet.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.380
This one.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.260
Excuse me. I'd like two of this.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.020
Here.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.900
Book sale. Book sale.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.620
Tales and anecdotes.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.580
Legends and novels.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.460
We have everything here.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:15.980
Excuse me. What books do you have here?

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:17.740
Who reads books nowadays?

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.580
All want to find some light readings like novels

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.900
for some fun.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.020
Domineering Lord In Love With Bossy Kitchen Maid

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.340
One Night

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.980
The content is all totally legal and logical.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.260
You want one?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.300
I'll buy all of these only I have money.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.100
Thank you. See you.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.500
Book sale. Book sale.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.860
Sis. This time we come here

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.180
only with ten taels.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.700
Later, I'll go find a bungalow.

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.700
The rent for month, let's say, it's five taels.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.820
Then the five left,

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.180
if we spend it only necessities,

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.460
should be enough for two months.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.980
If we can find a job before paying the rent,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.300
then we're making the first step.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:13.860
But the pay here is much lower

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.420
than in the capital.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.580
What can we do?

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.460
If girls can't find a job in the public,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.820
then I'll write novels.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:23.740
In that case, no one will find I'm a girl.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.460
Novel? What are you going to write about?

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.020
About...

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.900
About Tang Tianyuan.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.140
Tang Tianyuan?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.060
Tang Tianyuan is the dream of millions of girls.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.220
We only told stories based on him for a few days,

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.860
and we earned so much money.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.900
He's our money-spinner.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.180
But if you use his name,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.660
you might get into trouble.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.220
Of course I'll change his name.

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.100
And do you remember the name

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.940
I used when I was telling his stories in the capital?

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.180
Tang Feilong?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.380
If I don't show my face in the public,

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.300
no one will find out my identity, right?

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.220
Let's eat mooncake.

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.740
Just two here. You eat it.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.460
Two months later...

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:20.300
Tang's Mansion

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.220
Capital City
Tang's Mansion

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:22.340
Tang's Mansion

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:31.660
Flygon, where did you go to have fun?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.660
I miss you so much.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:35.660
I've told you so many times.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.860
Don't call me Flygon.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.380
Not just me.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.300
Now everyone in the city knows

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.500
you're F-ly-gon.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.700
You're an army general,

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:48.540
but spend all day reading novels.

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.460
That's such a waste a time.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.340
The novel about Tang Feilong

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:53.580
is the best-seller.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.500
I paid a lot for this copy.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.260
That storyteller girl got you into so much trouble.

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.530
At first, I thought the stories of Tang Feilong

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:02.620
will be short-lived.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.300
Now it seems

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.500
to become the prototype of Miaomiaosheng's novel.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.660
Now everyone knows

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.540
the Tang Feilong in this novel is Tang Tianyuan.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.460
It might not do you good as a county magistrate.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.940
County magistrate? What are you talking about?

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:19.940
Kneel down and accept the decree.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.180
Imperial Decree: third rank court official

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.100
Hanlin scholar Tang Tianyuan

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.540
under the name of Tang Longfei,

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:34.140
is hereby appointed as County Magistrate of Tongling.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.460
Follow the imperial orders, take down corrupted officials,

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.340
and help the citizens.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.320
Appoint primus of military exam Zheng Shaofeng

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.620
as head constable of Lingtong

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.780
to assist the investigation, assuming the office today

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.180
to investigate the illegal gold mining of Sang Jie,

00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.780
trace back the gold and bring justice to the public.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.100
Bestow commissioned purple goldstone government seal.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.780
Show it in time of need,

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:52.980
to mobilize

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.540
the government army of affiliate states as a commissioner.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.380
Respect this.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.420
I respect, Your Majesty.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.620
What a surprise.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:16.940
You two can leave.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.220
Yes.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.020
After Sang Jie mined the gold,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:34.420
he was assassinated on the way back to the capital.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.580
There must be someone behind it.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.980
Do you think

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.780
this has something to do with Mr. Jiang?

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.740
We can't be sure of that, not until we get there,

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.700
and look into it.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.340
Well, I think

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.820
His Majesty is really our best buddy since we were kids.

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.620
Give us all those work

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.180
that will get us easily killed.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.620
Actually, His Majesty is

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.380
young as we are.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.020
He clearly knows that

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:00.780
not everyone in the palace can be trusted.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.220
In time of this,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.860
we are the only ones that can help him.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.540
But His Majesty is so good to you.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.020
He asked me to go with you.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.100
A primus of military exam

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:12.979
works for you as a head constable.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.780
You must be so honored.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.660
Do you know that

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:21.100
a simple minded man is easy to win other's trust.

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.020
You...

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:25.299
You can keep the pleasure.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.500
But your good days are about to end.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.380
What does that mean?

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.700
You don't know this.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.780
Miaomiaosheng's bookstore is in Tongling.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.260
Unscrupulous writer | Poor ending

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.220
Shameless and greedy | Disappoint the readers

00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:50.900
Who did this?

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.220
Make me sick every day.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.740
Might be some assholes

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.220
that are not satisfied with the ending,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.420
and find ways to mess with us.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:56.620
Foul eggs for yesterday.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:57.500
Fang
Foul eggs for yesterday.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:57.580
Rotten fruit before that.
Fang

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.060
Rotten fruit before that.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:17:58.780
Zhuang
Rotten fruit before that.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:58.820
Rotten fruit before that.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.100
And shit might come tomorrow.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.020
You aren't arresting him?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.700
That's the duty of constables.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.220
How can we do that?

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.020
That's right.

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.020
He's your loyal reader of your novel,

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.060
We think it might be just a burst of anger.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.740
He'll quiet down if we ignore him.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.260
Taking out anger on others.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.820
I must teach him a lesson,

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.140
and tell him what is teaching.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.620
Whey will he come?

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.860
In one-incense-stick's time.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.340
Clean it up.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.780
Zhuang, rip those on this side.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.980
Fang, clean those on that side.

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.980
Rip them all down.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.460
If it goes on like this,

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.780
we might have to go back to Jinan.

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.140
Readers are so prone to new stuff.

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.620
Bossy manager,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.460
spiteful lord,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.380
romantic scholar

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.100
I've written all I can think og.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.540
Sis. Tongling is not safe lately.

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.980
Lord Sang died.

00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:58.060
No one's managing the County Office.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.260
Pickpocketers and cons are everywhere.

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.180
Everyone's disquieted?

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.940
Who wants to read our novel at time like this?

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.260
Sang Jie was arrogant despotic here,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.860
and even mined gold.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.340
His death did justice.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:14.940
But...

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.860
he's really a good topic.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.380
Qingcheng, how about I make a transformation

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.740
and start to write detective novels?

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.140
Sis. I've told you so many times.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.980
We have no idea of the officials.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:27.700
How can we write it?

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.060
Things will eventually sort themselves out.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.300
The rent won't wait for us.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.740
I can write a prequel first to attract the readers.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.700
I'll leave the rest for the future.

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:50.500
Detective Tang Feilong
Prequel

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.900
Tongling County Office

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:03.660
Five. Five. Six.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.140
Eight.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.420
Bite it. Bite it.

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.420
Xiaoliu. This novel is intriguing.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:09.700
Cong Shun
Xiaoliu. This novel is intriguing.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.700
You can borrow it.
Cong Shun

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:10.980
Cong Shun

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.020
Zhao Xiaoliu

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.580
Li Dawang

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:24.660
He's sleeping?

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.900
Who's this?

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:35.820
The new county magistrate.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.260
The new county...

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:41.500
Get up. All of you. Wake up.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:42.420
Line up. Line up.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.420
Please.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.740
The officials are all here?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.780
Yes. I'm Cong Shun.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.860
This is Zhao Xiaoliu. Li Dawang.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.860
Right. My lord.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.100
Just call me Dawang.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.420
Where's my adviser?

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:19.980
How about my assistant?

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:25.180
Nice to meet you. I'm Tang Feilong.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.920
What's so funny?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.800
My lord. Your name...

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:43.190
My name is not good?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.110
It's good. Good.

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.310
It's so good that it becomes a household name.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:52.560
I took office.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.760
Why do you all know my name?

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.230
Actually, we know the name...

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.800
But don't know your name.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.760
Do you know my name or not?

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:03.680
My lord.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.640
What we know is another Tang Feilong.

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:10.760
The Tang Feilong in Miaomiaosheng's novel.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.830
Yeah, that Tang Feilong

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.500
can bring down thief gangs and fight bandits.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.470
Travel in heaven and Hades.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.230
Just for dating girls.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:19.430
What are you talking about?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.470
It's called win's the heart of the pretty.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.040
Right.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:24.830
The pretty.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:28.430
Is that a coincidence?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:29.400
that he shares my name?

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:32.520
My lord.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.560
This shows that you are destined for Tongling.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.680
Destined. Destined.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:42.470
Right.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.070
Now I'm going to give you a very important thing to do.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.830
We'll do that, my Lord.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.310
Cleaning up.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.710
See how messy this place is?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.760
Look at that. Look.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.760
Start it now.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:00.760
Come on.

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:01.470
Get started.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.350
Cleaning up.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.760
Where is Miaomiaosheng's bookstore?

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.100
Gutong Bookstore

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.880
Pour water on you is leaving you some dignity.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.430
I'll make you pay if you dare find me trouble.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.070
The way you welcome guests

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.760
is quite extraordinary.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.470
No wonder it's Miaomiaosheng's place.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.310
Where is he?

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.430
Why would I tell you?

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.280
What are you doing?

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:46.190
I'll sue you for harrassment.

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:48.640
Hands off.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.280
No.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:49.710
Hands off.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:50.230
No way.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:06.920
What are you doing?

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.560
She had no legs.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:16.920
My enemy?

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.040
It's you.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.160
What?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Qingchen, send this troublemaker to the County Office.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.070
Sis. It's not him.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.310
It's not this guy.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:28.800
No, it's not this guy.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.710
Then...

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.800
Sir, I'm sorry.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.400
Wasted the water of footwashing Zhuang just prepared.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.800
W-What water?

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.680
Don't worry, sir. I'll go get you some dry clothes.

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.070
What are you looking at?

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.880
Have we met somewhere?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:06.800
You think too much.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.800
It's my first time here.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.640
I don't have time to know you yet.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.070
I'm sorry about that, sir.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:23.400
20% discount on all your purchase today

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.350
Please.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.230
Where's Miaomiaosheng?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.110
I'm the manager.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:37.830
Why are you looking for Mater Miao?

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.110
I read the novel he wrote.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.350
I think it's good.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.520
I want to meet him.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.520
Thanks for your compliment, sir.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:49.040
But Mater Miao is not at the bookstore.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:51.830
Then...

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280
Then...

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.350
Fang. Zhuang, Get all the books.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:06.160
Untold Stories of Tang Feilong, Side Stories of Tang Feilong.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.640
Get all the novels about Tang Feilong. Hurry.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.710
What are you giving me books?

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.160
I said I want to meet him.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.070
Mater Miao is really not here right now.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.040
Why don't you come back next year?

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.710
I heard that there's

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.710
a quite famous storyteller in the capital.

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.830
He told stories of Tang Tianyuan,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.400
but used the alias Tang Feilong.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:30.190
Since you're the manager here,

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:31.760
I just want to prove one thing.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.430
What's between Miaomiaosheng and this storyteller?

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.830
Or are the two the same guy?

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.800
How's that possible?

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.560
It must be Mater Miao

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.710
got inspired after

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.760
hearing his stories.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.640
That means

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.040
Mater Miao has been to the capital.

00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:56.520
So, you know,

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.310
Mater Miao is going to write a series of detective stories?

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:04.680
So you're here to get information of his novels.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.430
I just want to ask you one thing.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.280
Does he already know the content of these cases

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.950
or does he make these all up?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.430
You're here for trouble, right?

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.920
Why do you hate Tang Tianyuan do much

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:19.710
that you want to make up these stories of him?

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.680
In Tongling, such a small woods,

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.430
I can't believe there's an old bird like you.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.830
I can't imagine Tang Tianyuan

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:29.190
has male admirers.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:33.000
I just want to know what kind of guy can

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.800
obscene words and lewd poems.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.190
Obscene words and lewd poems?

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:38.800
Mater Miao has nothing to do with you.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:39.680
Drink your tea.

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.230
It's getting late.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.710
Could you give Mater Miao a message?

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.760
Grandstanding and writing nonsense

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.950
will make him suffer.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.310
Who are you threatening?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.040
Sir.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.430
Your clothes hasn't been cleaned.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.680
Thank you.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.310
You haven't paid for those.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.920
Two taels for one, four taels for two.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.110
Money.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.430
You're back.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.710
I heard you went to find the master who gave you that name.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.920
I didn't see Miaomiaosheng.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.400
But guess who I saw today.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.520
The girl that told stories in the capital.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.040
Fate brings people together no matter how far apart they are.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:50.710
What did you get here?

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.350
I think it's bad fate.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.310
Untold Stories of Tang Feilong.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.350
I have my own way to deal with Miaomiaosheng.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.800
Now we have to get down to business.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.830
Go get Sang Jie's file,

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:05.230
and let's analyze the case.

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.190
I only know kongfu,

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:07.710
and play with spears and sword.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.880
I'll have a headache when seeing words.

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.950
When we're talking in front of our men,

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.830
don't make me embarrassed, okay?

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:22.640
Cong Shun.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.400
Yes, my lord.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.830
Put up a poster tomorrow.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.920
I want to recruit an adviser.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.950
Yes, my lord.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.000
What's so smelly?

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:54.520
It stinks. It stinks.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.710
It's her again.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.640
Such a large pile,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:08.590
why do carry it back all on your own?

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.310
What's this?

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.520
Recruitment Notice.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.710
I'm blessed by the heaven.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.470
County office is recruiting an adviser?

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:26.310
Correct.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.950
Assume office right away,

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:34.800
and get paid for 18 months.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:38.310
18 months.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.040
And I can go to the county office

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.160
to gather materials for my novel,

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.400
and see how the Yamen handles the case.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.190
Then I'll know

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.590
how to write my detective novels.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.680
What so you say? It will be a waste,

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.470
if I'm not going, right?

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.310
No way.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.560
A girl can't stay in a place like the county office.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:59.350
Qingchen, Are we gonna trap ourselves in Tongling?

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.040
You don't want to go back to the capital?

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:04.800
I never thought about where I'm going.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.400
All I know is wherever you go,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.230
I'll go with you.

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.590
You went to the capital just to see Tang Tianyuan.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.280
You took such a big risk to see him.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.000
Is it worth it?

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.560
Whether he remembers me or not,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.950
I want to stand in front of him

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.710
and say 'thank you' to him in person.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.830
My lord. Please hire me.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.280
My lord.

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:41.710
I've been practicing Bell Shield for 20 years.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:43.830
Unbreakable.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.190
My lord. Please hire me.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.710
Can you read?

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:51.830
I-I'll learn.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.950
M-My lord. I can't be an adviser,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:57.710
but I can be a constable.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.310
Let me be head constable.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.280
Get lost. Dare take my job.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.190
Get out of here.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.400
My lord. You aren't trying to get rid of me, right?

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:10.560
Next one.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:22.110
My lord. I'm a cultivated talent.

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:23.070
I'm Lu Youde.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.760
Six, hurry up and get this old man home.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.560
And find him a good doctor.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:34.400
Okay.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.400
Just go, go.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.640
Next one.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.430
My lord. No next.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:43.470
No more?

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.350
Who said no more?

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.590
I signed up, too.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.680
Why didn't you call my name?

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:53.760
A girl?

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.470
Isn't he the man I poured

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:56.830
water on yesterday?

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.560
Can't believe he's county magistrate.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:00.400
That's unfortunate.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.070
How can a lady sign up for this?

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.760
Get out of here.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:06.470
What's wrong with ladies? I'm already here.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.310
Just test me.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
What are you doing here?

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:13.070
I just poured some water on you yesterday.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:14.760
My lord. You're generous enough to forgive me.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.230
Let's just forget about that, alright?

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.280
This bookstore is yours.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.160
But this county office is mine.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:23.830
Of course you can apply for this job.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:24.710
But...

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.920
every step you take is worth one tael.

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.800
Cong Shun, count that for her.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.680
Offending our lord will only make your life miserable.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:35.680
Girl, don't embarrass yourself.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.400
Go back home.

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.110
If you can't afford this,

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.350
just hurry home.

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.070
Wait.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.680
She's leaving?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.710
Just that easy?

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.110
What's she doing?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:53.680
I can pay.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.710
I'm coming.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:28.840
My lord.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.629
Neither my feet nor my shoes touched the ground.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:33.360
It's not against your will.

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.120
You can't punish me.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.949
That's right.

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.149
But I'm still not gonna hire you as an adviser.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.600
You're a magistrate. How come your words don't count?

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.360
You put up the poster

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.360
and announced to recruit an adviser.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.189
I'm here to apply for this job

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.560
but you won't even give me a chance.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.909
You're breaking your word to the public.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.799
How can people be convinced in this case?

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.800
It makes sense.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:56.470
Get the paper.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.150
You want me to take office right away?

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:00.710
Exam.

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:02.760
Round One

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:04.630
Ye Gong was fond of dragons.
Round One

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.100
Dragons were carved on the hooks and pillars,
Round One

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.120
Dragons were carved on the hooks and pillars,

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.190
and painted on all the walls of his house.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.120
A dragon heard about it from the heaven and came down.

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.560
It poked its head into the window, coiled its tail to the room.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.390
Ye Gongzhi was frightened out of his wits at the sight of it.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:17.390
He trembled all over and hurriedly hid himself.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.040
It turned out that Ye Gong was not really fond of dragons.

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.600
He only liked those in dragons' shape but not real ones.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.910
My lord. I'm done. Please have a look.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.470
What's that mess?

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.600
Are those characters?

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.520
Ye Gong was fond of dragons.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.000
Dragons were carved on the hooks and pillars,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.230
and painted on all the walls of his house.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.800
A dragon heard about it from the heaven and came down.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.040
It poked its head into the window, coiled its tail to the room.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.390
Good.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.470
This is my original shorthand method.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.390
It takes time and effort to follow the book.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.760
Shorthand is, of course, for the most important matters.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.230
What do you think, my lord?

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.710
Writing down the text

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:59.150
is the basics out of basics.

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.670
Next, I'll test you

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.430
whether your brain keep up with your hand?

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.320
Let's start.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:07.420
Lord Tang is on a trial in court.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.470
Round Two
Lord Tang is on a trial in court.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:09.230
Round Two

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.500
Three suspects--Tom, Dick and Harry.
Round Two

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.390
Three suspects--Tom, Dick and Harry.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.430
When he questioned Tom,

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:17.320
there was a sudden thunder.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.150
No one got what Tom said.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.360
At this time, Lord Tang asked

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.470
'What did Tom say?'

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:27.120
Dick said,

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.600
'Tom didn't admit to doing anything wrong.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.910
He's not a suspect.'

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:36.710
Harry said the suspect was Tom.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.390
He admitted his own crime.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:39.630
So, my question is--

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:42.120
which of these three is the suspect?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.360
I know.

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.800
The criminal is Tom.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:46.950
It's Dick.

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.600
Wrong. It's Harry.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.800
Although the thunder covered up Tom's words,

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.710
what Tom said was nothing more than two things.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.760
One, he admitted that he was a criminal.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.280
Then Dick has no reason to hide it for him.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.600
So Tom must have

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.520
denied that he was a criminal.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.910
Then Dick must have told him what he said.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.430
This Harry is different.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.950
He was so certain that it was Tom.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.000
A liar must be a criminal.

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.710
That's true.

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:19.320
Awesome.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.320
A bunch of lame teammates!

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.950
Can't even compete with a girl.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.560
My lord. How's it?

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.080
What else do you want to test? When can I take office?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.600
Tomorrow.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.080
You've given me the word. Deal.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:35.950
18-months salary for a year. You can't break that promise.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:37.190
Three-day probation.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.800
Make me any trouble and the job is not yours.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.600
Goodbye.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.000
Adviser, please.

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:52.600
Wait for me by the door tomorrow.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.390
No problem.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:54.950
Let's go.
