<i>When My Love Blooms </i>

3
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.230
I'm sorry Ji Soo...

4
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.920
for all of the mean things I've done.

5
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:06.460
I will take all of your burdens with me

6
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.780
so that only the good things will be left with you.

7
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.600
Please be happy, Ji Soo.

8
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.810
Dad! I'm even more sorry!

9
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:50.370
Dad! Please tell Mom and Ji Yeong that I'm sorry, okay?

10
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.720
Dad!

11
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.910
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

12
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.080
Dad!

13
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.020
From now on,

14
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.820
I don't want anyone else to leave.

15
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.220
But why are you here?

16
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.830
I thought I should be next to you.

17
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.600
I felt helpless as if I was totally left alone during that time as well.

18
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.980
Don't be so sad.

19
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.120
That way, your Father will be able to leave this world comfortably.

<i>Episode 12
 - It's been a while, Seonbae.</i>

22
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.780
Yes, it has. (TL Note: He goes from speaking informally to formally after the pause.)

23
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.730
One way or another, it seems we meet each other in a setting like this.

24
00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.370
At this age, everyone meets like this at one point.

25
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.190
Let's not fight today.

26
00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:51.030
When did we fight?

27
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.510
We have just had some conversations without hindrance.

28
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.230
It's not that you were both outspoken. It's that you were both harsh.

29
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.920
Well, do you want to see what harsh really is? Huh?

30
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.580
It's because I'm happy. I'm just glad that everyone is here.

31
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.040
Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the past. I've been missing it a lot.

32
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.550
When you've had so many good times laughing the whole time we were together,

33
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.580
it's only natural that we miss that period.

34
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.870
When Ji Soo was around, everyone met up and so we had a good time.

35
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.290
Ji Soo is the flowering time of our youth. 
(also name of the show)

36
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.330
<i>What about me?</i>

37
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.520
That's right. We should give you a name too.

38
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.890
Would you like to be "Video" call?

39
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.800
Or just "Fool"? 
(TL Note: The joke is derived from the word "Hwasang" which could mean video or fool depending on how it's used. The first character is also a homonym with a Korean word for flower)

40
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.250
Okay.

41
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.980
<i>Oh you fool.</i>

42
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.110
Did you meet Mom and Ji Yeong?

43
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.410
You must be so happy.

44
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.060
I'm the only one left now.

45
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.570
Tell Mom and Ji Yeong

46
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.840
to appear in my dreams just once...

47
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.870
that I really really miss them.

65
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.910
It's a shame someone like him has gone.

66
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.610
Indeed.

67
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.150
If he hadn't had that accident, he would have gone all the way up in the political sphere.

68
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.430
What are you talking about? He was a card we could use.

69
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.240
I'm saying that it's a shame because we didn't get to fully use him.

70
00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.440
Ah, yes.

71
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.490
Although, he isn't completely useless just yet.

72
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.410
Even if a person is dead, the facts are still there.

73
00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:50.830
- Her father's funeral? 
 - Yes.

74
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.560
Apparently, he stayed in a care center for a long time and then passed away.

75
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.650
She's really the most. He must have felt so sorry to death for her.

76
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:04.410
So, Jae Hyeon attended the funeral?

77
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:05.950
Yes.

78
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.590
Wow. I'm going to ride comfortably today because of you, Secretary Kang.

79
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.750
I pulled all-nighters for the past couple of days, my eyelids are like elevators.

80
00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.110
They keep just keep coming down.

81
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.590
I will safely escort you.

82
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.900
Yes. This punk Jae Hyeon said he would come after a phone call, but why is he not coming.

83
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:28.990
Did he go to take a poo again? I told this fool to go to the hospital, but this fool...

84
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.010
Is everything okay with the Vice President?

85
00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.880
I'm sure things will get better if he goes to the hospital.

86
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.830
No. No. About Ji Soo's father.

87
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.040
What about him?

88
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:45.280
Is it not? Isn't his name Yoon Hyeong Goo?

89
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.990
So what about it?

90
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.550
No. It's nothing. I'm sorry.

91
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:59.280
Perhaps, did you know about that too?

92
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.190
Did you know too?

93
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:03.250
Of course, I do.

94
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.740
Wow. How did you know Secretary Kang?

95
00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.420
A couple of years ago, Vice President learned about Ji Soo's father's situation,

96
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.150
but the associated district attorney was Ji Soo's father's name.

97
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.190
Yeah yeah.

98
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:19.680
At first, I thought it was just a namesake, but the condolence calls confirmed it was him.

99
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:25.110
What are you doing. Let's go.

100
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.240
Yes.

101
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.010
You must be tired.

102
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:38.620
You must have cried a lot.

103
00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:42.800
Saying, "Aigoo. My poor Ji Soo."

104
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.480
You're so courageous considering you're a man who is having an affair.

105
00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.750
How could you go to that woman's father's funeral?

106
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.400
Let's end this.

107
00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.740
Seo Kyeong. Let's end it.

108
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:04.640
Alright. Do what you want.

109
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.190
That's weird.

110
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.790
Grandpa's toys are gone.

111
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.510
He gave those to me.

112
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.640
Really? When?

113
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.150
The day before he passed away.

114
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.270
I felt like he knew who I was. He wanted to give me something.

115
00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.750
So he asked me if I liked the toys. I said yes.

116
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:56.740
Good job. Grandpa must have been happy.

117
00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:00.810
He said to listen to you, encourage you,

118
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.570
and live happily together for a long time.

119
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.050
Grandpa's diary?

120
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:30.450
Yeah. I think so.

121
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:37.900
He had such a hard time every day. When did he have time to write all this?

122
00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.390
There are a lot of Chinese characters.

123
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.690
Back then, your Grandpa

124
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.410
was the Chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office

125
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.980
That's right.

126
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.910
There really are a lot of Chinese characters.

127
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.560
Totally like him. No one can't stop him.

128
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.240
<i>Dear Ji Soo,</i>

129
00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:10.310
<i> It's a warm sunny day with a wonderfully pleasant breeze.</i>

130
00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:16.710
<i>Today, my mind is as clear as the weather</i>

131
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:20.380
<i>so I feel as comfortable as wool.</i>

132
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:26.010
<i>However, all of a sudden,</i>

133
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.730
<i>I start to worry about a few things.</i>

134
00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:35.800
<i>What the date was two days ago, what I ate for dinner yesterday,</i>

135
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.820
<i>how I got this red stain on my sleeve,</i>

136
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:46.300
<i>why that person sitting across from me is glaring at me.</i>

137
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.430
<i>Because I don't remember anything,</i>

138
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:56.150
<i>when my mind starts to fog up, I wonder if I made a mistake</i>

139
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.810
<i>or if I did anything mean to you.</i>

140
00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:04.180
<i>I'm too embarrassed to ask others</i>

141
00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:09.000
<i>and get scared thinking about the answer I would get from them.</i>

142
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:12.640
<i>After becoming like this,</i>

143
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:18.180
<i>when my mind becomes sound as if waking from sleep,</i>

144
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.950
<i>I think and make inferences</i>

145
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.090
<i>to hold onto reality.</i>

146
00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:32.290
<i>I am fully aware of the struggle that you endured up to now.</i>

147
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:38.230
I knew it so well that I couldn't even acknowledge it.

148
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:44.210
<i>Not too long ago when Jae Hyeon visited, I knew with one look.</i>

149
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:50.750
Whether I was mentally clouded or not, it was a face that I couldn't ever forget.

150
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.800
Even after all this time, he still had his eyes fixed only on you.

151
00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.080
<i>And looking at you smiling back, you looked like a 20-year-old young lady</i>

152
00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:08.580
<i>After watching the both of you, I had a heavy heart.</i>

153
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:15.720
<i>When I saw you both happy together, even after this time,</i>

154
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.880
<i>I don't know why my heart was heavy.</i>

155
00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:24.080
<i> On a day like today when my mind is clear,</i>

156
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.470
<i>I wanted to tell you, but</i>

157
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.730
<i> no matter how much courage I gather up</i>

158
00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:36.090
<i>I really couldn't bring myself to tell you.</i>

159
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:40.560
<i>So I will leave it here in writing.</i>

160
00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.220
<i>You knew that he was Ji Soo's father?</i>

161
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.020
Since when.

162
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.040
Since five years ago.

163
00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.990
Hey. Honestly, the charges the prosecutor made against him made him like that,

164
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.340
but you still met Ji Soo knowing that fact?

165
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.980
When I saw Ji Soo again, I couldn't think of anything else, but her.

166
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:30.740
Because meeting her again felt like a miracle in itself.

167
00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.860
However, after recently meeting her father at the care center,

168
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:42.860
all of those legal complaints in his work bag did haunt me.

169
00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:44.880
Did only those papers haunt you?

170
00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.950
After hearing that, I felt like I beat myself up thinking about your father's grim funeral.

171
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:58.820
Well... I can't say that I don't feel anything, but it's not Ji Soo's fault.

172
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.970
Does Ji Soo know?

173
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.510
She shouldn't ever have to know.

174
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.040
Of course.

175
00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.160
That's why keep your mouth closed starting now and take on my divorce case.

176
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.360
Ah why are you doing that.

177
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.480
You told me to keep my mouth closed.

178
00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.500
You crazy fool.

179
00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.590
So you've decided to take legal action?

180
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:30.440
Not yet, but if it gets to that point, please do it for me.

181
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.010
While taking on cases that have come

182
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.340
and grabbing onto cases that are about to go, I have pretty much dealt with all sorts of clients from all walks of life.

183
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:45.080
However, for you, I really don't want to do it.

184
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:57.120
Is wanting to live with me a valid statement still?

185
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.460
I'm glad to hear it, but why did you suddenly have the heart to do that?

186
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.790
Is it related to you leaving that school?

187
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.660
I want to make Mom happy.

188
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:19.470
Mom would need you to be happy, no?

189
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.900
It's because I want Mom to get married.

190
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.640
However, if I'm around, I would become an obstacle.

191
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.340
Does Mom have someone to marry?

192
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.370
It seems there is.

193
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:49.460
But, could you wait a little bit?

194
00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.030
It hasn't been that long since Grandpa passed away,

195
00:19:54.030 --> 00:20:00.440
and Mom is having a hard time. So I want to stay with her a little while longer.

196
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.400
Alright.

197
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.620
Is it okay for us for the other party to know that we're meeting together, just us, like this?

198
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:17.520
It's alright. The other party also already knows.

199
00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.530
Well, at this point in time its not something to hide from each other.

200
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.880
By the way, because you converted those borrowed name accounts to your name,

201
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.500
you became the largest shareholder. I offer you my congratulations.

202
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:32.430
Since Hyeong Seong Holdings is the largest listed company on the stock market,

203
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:37.220
should I now call you Chairman Han?

204
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.950
Thank you, but I believe it's too early to exchange those greetings.

205
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.370
The shares in favor of Chairman Jang are even without the pensions and dividends from the shares bought and managed by our board of directors.

206
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.460
And even if we exclude the small shareholders, it is 36.8%.

207
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.700
Our side with the two of you combined with mine are 35.65%

208
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.130
By the next shareholders meeting

209
00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.630
I can amass about 1.2% more in shares.

210
00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:03.660
I can amass about 2%.

211
00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.190
Then... hold on a moment. Then

212
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:12.510
we become 38.85% and Chairman Jang 36.8%.

213
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:15.060
Literally it is like walking on thin ice.

214
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.400
Additionally, the other side has a strong card left.

215
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.100
Up to now the difference in shares is 1.15%.

216
00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.230
We are ahead 2.19 million shares according to current market prices.

217
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:32.350
Look here, can you say we are ahead with a percentage point of 1.15?

218
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.110
On the surface it looks like that.

219
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:38.510
But the Hyeong Seong holdings employees and their  9% of director-managed shares are on your side.

220
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:44.360
The pensions and the collective investment scheme shares from banks have no reason to side with VP Han.

221
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.940
So, the defense of management rights can without burden—

222
00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.250
Look. What did you say last time?

223
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.740
If Jae Hyeon were to take those shares he would need to pay out several dozen billion won in taxes,

224
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.210
so he would crawl back to us himself.

225
00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.590
But what happened. He paid it well and took it all.

226
00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:01.090
That Seoul Bank would lend all that money—

227
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.580
I knew it would be like that.

228
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:07.600
We should have called the reporter and state, "I was unaware of the changed expectations of the people."

229
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.820
"I'm sorry. I will give all of my assets to a scholarship fund."

230
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.500
If I were to say something along these lines at most it would've been only a few months.

231
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.970
It would have been better to be in the slammer (jail).

232
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:17.070
I am sorry.

233
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.510
Who did you say were backing Jae Hyeon?

234
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:23.170
Yes, the confirmed figures are Lee Hyo Sin from Changwon, South Gyeongsang province

235
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.650
and Song In Soo from Gwangju City, Gyeonggi Province.

236
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.540
Both are famous super-ants (ants: individual investors who have amassed billions in profits) amongst those in the know in finance—

237
00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.340
What super-ant, super-ants freeze and die.

238
00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:33.300
They don't attempt to do something with a single company.

239
00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.040
Instead they are thieves plotting to raid the whole corporate group.

240
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.730
Wow. I have to spend my efforts on these low-life beggars.

241
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.040
I can show my anger daily, yet it doesn't end.

242
00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:48.710
Look. Listen well.

243
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:52.470
Han Jae Hyeon. He's not one to trifle with.

244
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:57.890
Just because I pay them an income, the employees of this company are on our side.

245
00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:00.930
Because we've dealt with our core investors for a long time, they will side with us.

246
00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.670
These kinds of empty words, pack them away.

247
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:08.060
From now, think from the perspective of Han Jae Hyeon.

248
00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:13.310
Think of all probabilities and hold your territory. Do you understand?

249
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.050
Yes.

250
00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:20.740
Hak Seo, prepare what I told you to last time.

251
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.260
Yes.

252
00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:28.290
Additionally, ants need to be trampled to death for them to become of sound mind.

<i>Confirmation Notice of Dissolution of Marriage</i>

256
00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.040
I'm not sure if you can utilize this.

257
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.570
What?

258
00:23:55.570 --> 00:24:02.210
Yoon Ji Soo's father is the enemy of Jae Hyeon's father.

259
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:09.100
Jae Hyeon and that woman, if they were to know all the details,

260
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:14.950
it would be difficult for them to see each other while smiling.

261
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.710
Tell me thoroughly.

262
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:39.360
I was hoping to meet tomorrow. If you're busy I will go to you.

263
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.950
<i>Confirmation Notice of Dissolution of Marriage</i>

264
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.780
Jae Hyeon gave this to me. What should we do?

265
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.460
I have no intention to divorce.

266
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:08.360
Ms. Yoon Ji Soo, you also seem to not have any intention to leave Jae Hyeon,

267
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.610
so live your whole live as a mistress and adulterer.

268
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.260
I had told you that I do not have a hint of grace.

269
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:24.420
Insulting others and trampling on them, I'm very good at those.

270
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:29.370
I know well because it's not something easily forgotten.

271
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.260
Do you have anything else you'd like to add?

272
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:39.370
I guess you'd like to demonstrate that you're strong,

273
00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:43.710
but I'm not sure if you'd be able to keep up that facade after hearing this news.

274
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:49.980
I don't like beating around the bush, so I'll tell you directly.

275
00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:54.040
Did you know

276
00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.220
that your father had caused Jae Hyeon's father's death?

277
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.480
If you can't believe me, look up the old documentation.

278
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.620
Which power line of prosecutors indicted Jae Hyeon's father.

279
00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:24.120
You go ahead with your style of doing things.

280
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.850
I'll forge ahead in my style.

281
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:07.850
I gave our divorce documents to Yoon Ji Soo in shreds piece by piece.

282
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.320
Don't worry, she'll probably return it taped

283
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.760
if she wishes for you, honey, to be divorced.

284
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.280
I have made you, honey, into a monster.

285
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.490
This is how I am.

286
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:30.570
Because you both are acting like this, it keeps occurring to me I should live the way I was made.

287
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:52.450
<i>Did you know that your father made Jae Hyeon's father die?</i>

288
00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.230
<i>No matter how much I tried to muster the courage,</i>

289
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:03.940
<i>I could not bear to say it in words,</i>

290
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:08.490
<i>so I wrote it down like this.</i>

291
00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.870
<i>It was the most barren funeral in the world.</i>

292
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.200
<i>No one came.</i>

293
00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.150
<i>Why he had made such a decision,</i>

294
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.890
<i>neither I nor my mom knew anything at all.</i>

295
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:47.350
<i>Until I had seen the many reports and legal files of complaint in my father's work bag.</i>

296
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:52.290
<i>The hatred and fury I felt about my father's death</i>

297
00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:57.480
<i>were actually longing and apologetic feelings towards my father.</i>

298
00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:03.140
<i>As more time passed, I felt even sorrier</i>

299
00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.770
<i>and missed him more.</i>

300
00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.210
Are you going somewhere?

301
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.550
You haven't left yet?

302
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:27.430
I was organizing something in the car. If you're going somewhere I will drive you there.

303
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.920
I just wanted to walk.

304
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.420
Yes.

305
00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.000
- Head off work .
 - Farewell.

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.960
<i>Loans will probably be difficult.</i>

323
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.410
<i>Your credit score is very low and you don't have a job with the four insurances (regular workers must have health, employee insurance, worker's comp, and pension),</i>

324
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:33.040
<i>and you also don't have your four insurances registered with a workplace.</i>

325
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.110
<i>Most of all, you have a lot of collateral loans, so for you to get a bank loan is also difficult.</i>

326
00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:43.210
I saw it well. Please tell the owner that I had a good look.

327
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:46.190
Yes, understood.

328
00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.210
How was the house?

329
00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:54.700
Are we moving?

330
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.990
I thought maybe.

331
00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.450
Why?

332
00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.690
Your grandfather told me I must become happy

333
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:05.070
so I thought, why not start with what's in front of me.

334
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.260
Do what?

335
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.280
Hello.

336
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.830
Long time no see, Yeong Min. Where did you come from?

337
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:16.300
We saw a house.

338
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.670
A house to move to.

339
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.320
Oh. You didn't go to school?

340
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.840
I don't go to school now.

341
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.460
Why?

342
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:31.710
I resigned.

343
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:39.550
It must be great Yeong Min, not going to school.

344
00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:43.010
Was there anything you wanted to do if you didn't go to school?

345
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:51.510
What was it for you? The things you wanted to do with grandma and aunt?

346
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.890
He asked to say the things you wanted to do. Why did you ask me?

347
00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:00.710
Since there was a lot you couldn't do because of me, you should do what you want.

348
00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.150
He's all grown up.

349
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.660
There were so so many things.

350
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.990
Grandfather was strict so I couldn't do anything until college.

351
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:18.620
Then when I became a college student, your aunt was a high schooler.

352
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.960
Later, when your aunt had proudly been accepted to a really good school, I was busy.

353
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.990
I even left home because I hated your grandfather.

354
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.590
Really?

355
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:30.300
With your grandmother and aunt,

356
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:35.340
I wanted to go to the hair salon, the department store, pubs,

357
00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.200
and take some photobooth photos that were all the rage back then.

358
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:42.400
And go to the noraebangs (karaoke rooms) that had just started doing business.

359
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:46.320
We also promised to go to a theme park together.

360
00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.740

Does Hyeong Jae Hyeon also know that you're moving?

372
00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.030
Not yet.

373
00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.710
Why?

374
00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.940
I'm reminded of the past.

375
00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:00.660
When I lived in the country, you and Hye Jeong came to visit.

376
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.290
Goodbye.

378
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.070
Ji Soo!

379
00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:21.810
You horrible girl.

380
00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.750
You're really bad.

381
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.630
I looked for you so much!

382
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:32.630
I worried about you so much! Yoon Ji Soo you're really something!

383
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.240
Seriously.

384
00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:40.270
Cheers!

385
00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:46.880
I just felt it. This kid Joo Yeong Woo knows!

386
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:51.490
So I tailed him for a few days, and what do you know? He goes to the outer city bus terminal.

387
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.620
She plopped down right next to me on the bus.

388
00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.560
I felt like my heart was going to fall out of my chest!

389
00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:00.020
You should be happy I came here with no incident. I was determined to murder you.

390
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.090
My only fault was doing what Ji Soo asked.

391
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:07.650
You're right. This girl's the problem!

392
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.880
Because dad had to quit work in a bad way there's no pension.

393
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.700
He's not in a good place emotionally,

394
00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:21.830
so my uncle (dad's younger brother) said that he would steward the compensation well.

395
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:23.970
Since then, I haven't been able to reach him.

396
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.550
Heol. That's crazy.

397
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:31.460
So we don't have anything. No money, nor people.

398
00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:36.260
That's why you should come to Seoul. I'll be there with you.

399
00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:38.710
It's comfortable here.

400
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:42.520
The cost of living is cheap. If you go out a bit you can see the ocean.

401
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.980
Moreover, there's no department store.

402
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:50.290
This place is too salty (to make me tear).

403
00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.020
Yoon Ji Soo is salty. The ocean is salty.

404
00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.230
It's a heaven for salt.

405
00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:59.130
Please say something if things are hard.

406
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:04.010
Hye Jeong is here for you and me too.

407
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:08.170
That's true.

408
00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.910
That's why I'm okay.

409
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.130
What do you mean you're okay.

410
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.680
You're peeling garlic with hands that used to play the piano.

411
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.240
It's actually kind of cost-efficient.

412
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.650
<i>That summer, the zinnia flowers had survived.</i>

413
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:40.590
<i>It weathered a storm. Again a storm. After it didn't fall</i>

414
00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:45.320
<i>like the hail falling down, it bore red flowers.</i>

415
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.690
<i>That summer I was in the middle of a storm.</i>

416
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:57.620
<i>That summer, my despair also bore red flowers as if by some cruel joke.</i>

417
00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:02.010
<i>Again, even with subsequent storms, they didn't fall.</i>

418
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.930
<i>When they fall, they rise</i>

419
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.200
<i>into full fire, those hardy buds</i>

420
00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.130
<i>cover the small yard about forty square meters or so in a bed of fire.</i>

421
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.790
<i>Like some stunt, my despair also came to an end.</i>

422
00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:25.690
<i>Ji Soo, the difficult times that you are enduring,</i>

423
00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.720
<i>by today, even by tomorrow morning,</i>

424
00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.860
<i>I pray with my whole heart they will end.</i>

425
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:40.230
<i>Until we meet again, I hope you will always be yourself.</i>

426
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.150
<i>From Chuncheon, Mr. Han Jae Hyeon</i>

427
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:47.330
<i>sent this poem, "That Summer's End" by Lee Seong Bok along with his radio shoutout.</i>

428
00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:52.650
<i>The requested piece is André Gagnon's "Comment au Premier Jour" (Like the First Day).</i>

429
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.910
If you think about Jae Hyeon, it's something that's heartbreaking.

430
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.870
It happened in the past.

431
00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.080
Seonbae is still having a hard time even now.

432
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.850
He didn't even know anything until his father became that way

433
00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.350
and didn't do anything about it.

434
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.100
But all of that is because of me.

435
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:16.130
He was arrested by the police because of me.

436
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.240
He was dragged into the army because of me.

437
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:28.150
He would look for me during his off time because I had disappeared.

438
00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:32.110
- It's all because of— 
- Then it's all because of me.

439
00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:36.360
How Hyeong Jae Hyeon became that way.

440
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:39.350
It's honestly because of me.

441
00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:41.610
What are you talking about?

442
00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:46.820
I was the one who reported him when he was on the wanted list.

443
00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.080
Why would you?

444
00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.230
I didn't want to see you having a hard time

445
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.140
because of Hyeong.

446
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.890
Whether it be in the past or now,

447
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.690
seeing you struggle is the hardest thing for me.

448
00:41:02.830 --> 00:41:06.190
But, after Jae Hyeon was arrested,

449
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:11.760
and seeing you ultimately separated, instead of thinking to myself how fortunate and great it was,

450
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.660
I was so tortured.

451
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:21.880
Since what sticks around longer than a wound is guilt.

452
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:28.830
That guilt prevented me from properly confessing my feelings to you.

453
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:33.470
While on my way back from reporting Jae Hyeon, I thought

454
00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:40.120
it would be hard for me to end up happy with Ji Soo.

455
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:47.420
That's why you shouldn't harbor any guilt.

456
00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:52.700
I just know better than anyone about that.

457
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.530
<i>There is something I need to tell you.</i>

458
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.060
Ji Soo isn't picking up her phone, right?

459
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.970
Did something happen to her?

460
00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:35.890
Ji Soo knows about what happened between your father and her father.

461
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:40.320
Ji Soo told me never to tell you, but—

462
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.920
Then why are you telling me?

463
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.690
You knew about the situation between the fathers, correct?

464
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:58.700
After hearing about it for the first time, I did think about Ji Soo, but I also thought about you a lot, Hyeong.

465
00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:05.810
About how you could have endured all this time with those scars you have.

466
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.010
Are you really okay?

467
00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:17.570
If that question is asking if I can endure, then the answer is yes.

468
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:19.950
Everything is okay now.

469
00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:27.530
When I see you and Ji Soo, you two seem like you are living in another dimension way ahead of me.

470
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:33.470
A place I can't go or even think to live in.

471
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:38.160
That's why, even though there isn't really anything I can do,

472
00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:45.220
I always think, "Why do those two always have to go through so many hardships?"

473
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:51.950
"Why are they so alike?"

474
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:57.470
Just say it comfortably, that our destinies are really strenuous.

475
00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:56.300
<i>Seonbae, I'm near your work. Are you perhaps not there?</i>

476
00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.030
<i>I'll head over there.</i>

477
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:04.170
<i>Where are you?</i>

478
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.150
<i>In front of your place</i>

479
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:11.450
<i>Then let's meet in the middle. That park we went to last time.</i>

480
00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:40.790
I wanted to give you this. It's my dad's diary.

481
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:45.250
I thought you would need it more than I do.

482
00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:46.600
Why are you giving this to me?

483
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.460
I thought it would help you with your long battle.

484
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:54.140
There is some information regarding Chairman Jang in there.

485
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:00.230
Also, I want to finish my battle as well.

486
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:07.960
While reading the diary, I found out that my father indicted your father.

487
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.520
After that day, I kept fighting with myself.

488
00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:18.690
Mostly with Ji Soo 1 and Ji Soo 2, but sometimes Ji Soo 3 showed up, too.

489
00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:24.350
I debated with myself if I should leave, act like I didn't know,

490
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:28.650
or just say everything and wait for my sentencing.

491
00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:35.680
All these scenarios I grappled with back and forth, in my head, but there is no conclusion.

492
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.660
Now...

493
00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.450
I really don't want anyone else to leave.

494
00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.440
I thought if it would b e better to seek advice from you.

495
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:53.790
I've even thought about senseless ideas like that.

496
00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.850
Now, after seeing you, I can't even bring myself to look at you.

497
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.790
Ji Soo.

498
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:13.560
If we are going to add the words, "because of someone" to my father's situation, it should be placed on me.

499
00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:21.620
A couple of days before he passed away, your father summoned me.

500
00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:27.370
He remembered all of the things that happened before and told me about them.

501
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:34.180
The person your father despised the most was me.

502
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:42.940
<i>If I hadn't run away with you that time, your father wouldn't have harbored a deep hatred towards me,</i>

503
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:47.630
<i>and that hatred wouldn't have translated into the indictment of my father.</i>

504
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:56.410
I was so foolish five years ago, I wasn't aware of such dynamics, so I couldn't piece those things together.

505
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:01.880
I couldn't hate nor forgive. I was muddled here and there.

506
00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:05.480
<i>5 years ago</i>
  Your father, who was in a predicament both outside and inside the company,

507
00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.480
was charged on grounds of suspicion of destroying the labor union,

508
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:11.900
then he gave up on his last bit of hope.

509
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.070
Did you find out which prosecutor charged my father?

510
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.800
Yes. However, they did mention that this was an unusual scenario.

511
00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.070
The prosecutor who was further developing your father's case

512
00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:26.690
suddenly was transferred to a provincial region (outside of Seoul-Gyeonggi) and the attending prosecutor was changed.

513
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.020
Your father was immediately indicted afterward.

514
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.490
Typically, they say this type of thing happens when the attending prosecutor contradicts his higher-ups.

515
00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.780
Anyway, the prosecutor who has been replaced is named Yoon Hyeong Goo who is in the direct line at the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office.

516
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.020
Who did you say the prosecutor was?

517
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:43.190
<i>Seoul Central Disctrict Prosecutor Yoon Hyeong Goo</i>

518
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:45.950
<i> It is Chief Prosecutor Yoon Hyeong Goo.</i>

519
00:48:50.690 --> 00:48:57.430
After meeting you, and after meeting your ailing father,

520
00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:03.930
my heart started to become conflicted like before. That's when your father had summoned me.

521
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:10.300
That day, aside from your father talking about apology and forgiveness,

522
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:16.940
what stuck with me the most was his plea to not let an already injured finger (soft spot) become more injured.

523
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:29.990
♫ <i>Perhaps, someday we will remember</i> ♫

524
00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:38.960
To me, you are someone who is also such a very pained finger,

525
00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:42.610
and since your father's heart and my heart are the same in that regard,

526
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.300
You becoming happy, I realized

527
00:49:48.380 --> 00:49:52.210
in that moment, would be the end of all of this suffering.

528
00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:59.310
♫ <i>Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years</i> ♫

529
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:02.250
Since I need to become happy,

530
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.400
♫ <i>But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you</i> ♫

531
00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:10.010
♫ <i>If we can return to that time, then I would tell you</i> ♫

532
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:16.240
I don't want to make the most painful mistake I've ever made twice.

533
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:26.530
♫ <i>I would embrace you once and tell you</i> ♫

534
00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:33.740
♫ <i>Someday, far in the future, even after time has passed</i> ♫

535
00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:40.090
♫ <i>You are no longer a memory, but my every day</i> ♫

536
00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:50.230
♫ <i>You are no longer a memory, but my every day</i> ♫

537
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:05.690
It's a lot darker than before and the pathway is steep.

538
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:08.300
But the main doorway is pretty.

539
00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:12.390
Is it? I guess we need to install them again—the CCTV and a door lock.

540
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:15.720
I need to bring them from my previous house. They are so expensive.

541
00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.790
Since Yeong Min is in middle school, he needs a room and I need one too.

542
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:24.110
In the spare room, I am going to achieve my dreams.

543
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.420
I'm going to open a piano school. Not a hakwon (after-school academy or cram school), but an actual school.

544
00:51:29.650 --> 00:51:31.810
You've achieved your dreams faster than most.

545
00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:36.680
It seems so. I was usually quick with everything I did.

546
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.420
- You're not going?
 - Yeah

547
00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:51.250
<i>Hyeong Seong</i>

548
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:54.280
I heard that the house was already signed over.

549
00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.300
Would it be possible to get the security deposit from the house I'm living in now?

550
00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.700
I'm not sure. They said they couldn't say how much it was signed for.

551
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.950
When will I be able to have a drink with my son?

552
00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:58.800
You said that you don't want me to grow up too quickly.

553
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.360
That's right.

554
00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.740
I still feel like it's such a waste seeing how you've grown this much.

555
00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:07.710
But, what about the piano school?

556
00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.370
You don't even have a piano.

557
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:11.990
I have money to buy a piano.

558
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:13.780
Really?

559
00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:17.440
Yeah. If I grind out a lot of lessons for the next couple of days.

560
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:19.300
How many days?

561
00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:21.560
About a month?

562
00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.270
Then, you moved here without a plan?

563
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:29.990
I've been busy lately, that's why.

564
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:37.960
My heart has been so muddled here and there. I've just been pulling those emotions together and consoling myself.

565
00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.280
Are you okay now?

566
00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:47.580
From now on, together in this new house, with a new heart,

567
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.310
let's live to the fullest.

568
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.200
Shall we cheer?

569
00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:29.260
<i>Hendrix
 Guitar Specialty Store</i>

570
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.020
<i>Acoustic Guitar. Electric Guitar. Classic Guitar</i>

571
00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.320
Excuse me, but

572
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.290
Do you watch "Love Letter" too, Seonbae?

573
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.230
You don't have work?

574
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:35.250
Ah, I'm really busy.

575
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:37.630
Do you like me that much?

576
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.120
You came to buy a guitar?

577
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.320
No, a piano.

578
00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.010
Why a piano?

579
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:46.550
I want to donate it to a piano hakwon I know

580
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.150
I have a piano.

581
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:50.110
- Lies. 
- It's the truth!

582
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.010
You didn't have one at your old house.

583
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:53.750
I bought a new one.

584
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.020
You just barely rented the house. How could you buy a piano so quickly?

585
00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.620
You looked into it, didn't you? You're a stalker. A real stalker.

586
00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:05.940
How were you able to afford the house?

587
00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.730
After speaking with the owner, we agreed on only paying half the security deposit.

588
00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.740
In other words, it's a monthly rental.

589
00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.810
Then, you're going to have a hard time every month.
(Many Koreans pay a 2-3 year housing deposit only and live rent-free. Then get the housing deposit back in full.)

590
00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:16.490
When have I ever not had a hard time?

591
00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.480
That's why I'll donate a piano.

592
00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:19.750
I don't want it.

593
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:25.190
You can just pay me back while you run the hakwon. How much will the hakwon fees be?

594
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:30.630
Since I don't have to pay rent or employees, uh about 50,000 KRW?

595
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.610
How much do the other hakwons charge?

596
00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.720
120k won? 130k won?

597
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.320
Then just pay me back slowly.

598
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.890
Wait a second. Let me calculate this.

599
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:44.460
I got a used piano that's worth around 1.8 million, in addition, let's say 50k a month,

600
00:56:44.460 --> 00:56:47.760
and let's say 5 people join thats 250k,

601
00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.510
and if I were to pay back 100k a month, in a year...

602
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.060
Are you just going to pay for the piano with your month's wages? Huh?

603
00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.040
Wait. Wait.

604
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.220
Let's just go take a look for now. How about it?

605
00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.850
Let's go.

606
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.130
It looks good on you.

607
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:17.240
I forgot about it. I was only trying it on.

608
00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.600
Keep it on.

609
00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:20.120
I don't want to. It burdens me.

610
00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:22.610
You already know that if you don't wear it, it needs to be thrown away.

611
00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.690
You know that there are no such things as returns or exchanges in my dictionary.

612
