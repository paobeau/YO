00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.240
Oh my.

13
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.650
Thank you.

14
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.870
Senior...

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.660
The column was good!

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.390
Same here.

17
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.730
Agreed.

18
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.290
These brats...

19
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.290
Whether it's good or bad, we should go get scolded.

20
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.820
I just arrived, so I need to sort this out a bit—

21
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.570
Follow me.

22
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.060
Like a magazine reporter should do, I will persuade the readers.

23
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.020
Persuade? You didn't post an apology like I told you to!

24
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.210
Who told you to write a diary like this?!

25
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.850
Is being a reporter a joke?

26
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.740
Are you looking down on the readers?!

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.170
Are you not scared of me?

28
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.240
<i>Thankfully, I didn't get in as much trouble as I thought I would.</i>

29
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.800
<i>Drink up. I'll buy today.</i>

30
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.290
Are you buying because I'll be unemployed tomorrow?

31
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.700
I forgot my ID for job search sites.

32
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.380
My resignation should help you out.

33
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.670
It's not that I don't understand the company's perspective, but my life is the one that will reset if my career is interrupted.

34
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.800
It's hard to get transferred somewhere as a chief editor.

35
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.360
And what can I learn at this age that I can start something new?

36
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.680
Are you saying... you're quitting?

37
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.920
They say my baby is having febrile seizures.

38
00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.390
If something goes wrong, it could affect the brain, so I have to stay by her side.

39
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.810
It's not serious though.

40
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.350
But I'm not looking after the oldest child that well either.

41
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.810
Because I forgot, my child

42
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.940
slept at the childcare center for a week without a blanket.

43
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.910
I was angry on top of feeling sorry.

44
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.370
So I'm planning to quit.

45
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.070
But... so suddenly—

46
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.970
I need to quit suddenly for you to not get fired.

47
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.940
You're the only one who has been loyal to "the baby" for 15 years.

48
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.290
Is there anybody who has more loyalty and affection for it than you?

49
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.450
How does not having a baby become a reason for disqualification?

50
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.420
Even if the magazine's credibility goes up because one has a child, what's the point if you can't see your child?

51
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.210
- Manager... 
 - Even if I quit, I'm going to pass over the chief editor position to you before I do.

52
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.850
This is completely due to my self-interest.

53
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.610
No matter how badly I treated you guys, you were the only one who understood my sincerity.

54
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.760
I'd like for you to be the chief editor.

55
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.530
Drink.

56
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.910
<i>There was no curative effects last time, but would you still like to try?</i>

57
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.590
<i>What if you come to love someone?</i>

58
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.350
<i>Have you never thought about wanting to be a father?</i>

59
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240
<i> I never did.</i>

60
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.930
<i> Who knew that I'd hurt this much because of you?</i>

61
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.590
<i>Stop it!</i>

62
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.920
<i>- Ow! 
 - Let go! Stop it!</i>

63
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.210
Han Yisang!

64
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.170
What are you doing?

65
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.440
I wish you'd be a little more pleased to see me...

66
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.190
It looks like you want to be alone, so I'll go.

67
00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:17.660
Don't go.

68
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.340
Do you want to talk with me?

69
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.650
Okay.

70
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.310
What'd you do today?

71
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.900
Living is like homework, so I was trying to solve it.

72
00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:45.000
I want to get the answer right, but it's hard.

73
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.250
Oh, that's very deep. Looks like my question was philosophical.

74
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.000
"Well, after finishing work and idly lying around,

75
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.740
I went out for a walk in the park, but suddenly thought about Jang Hari."

76
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.530
I thought you'd give an answer like that.

77
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:03.610
Why would you think about me?

78
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.380
Right.

79
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.060
Why did I... think of you?

80
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.470
Well, you could!

81
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:26.620
We've bumped into each other a lot here, and as a fellow resident of this neighborhood, you could suddenly wonder what I'm doing,

82
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.160
whether or not I'm coming out for a walk... you could be curious.

83
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.930
I was thinking what a strange person you were.

84
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.550
Usually, people will pretend to not be hurt even if they are,

85
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:43.530
will hide their scars, and cover up their weaknesses.

86
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.630
But... when I look at you,

87
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:54.080
I become embarrassed of myself for trying so hard to pretend to be strong.

88
00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.930
Like asking a man that you don't really like

89
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.210
to marry, the shock was big.

90
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.310
How... could you confess to the world?

91
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.250
You're brave, Jang Hari.

92
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.000
I'm saying this because I'm drunk, but...

93
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.130
Jang Hari... you did well.

94
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:40.870
This is... instead of a stamp.

95
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.840
Because of you, my heart feels very soft and fuzzy.

96
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:10.920
Thank you... for noticing.

97
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.130
Mother!

98
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:19.410
Oh? Yisang!

99
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:21.530
Go carefully.

100
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.300
Why did you come without contacting me?

101
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.500
Why would I? I know you're busy.

102
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.390
I left the fermented flatfish with the security office.

103
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.170
But... who's that?

104
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.460
- Hello. 
 - Ah, yes, nice to meet you.

105
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.820
She's a coworker. Let's go inside.

106
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.390
I... I'm not really curious about your house.

107
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.610
Let go of me. Let go.

108
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.980
What's your name?

109
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.720
I'm Jang Hari.

110
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.550
Hari!

111
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:04.620
Wow! Her name is as pretty as her face.

112
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.610
Thank you.

113
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.140
You should go.

114
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:13.010
- Mother, I'll escort you. 
 - To where?

115
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.340
Let go, let go!

116
00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:19.130
It looks like you're coming back from being out together.

117
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.550
Don't worry.

118
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:26.060
I... barely go to his house.

119
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.150
So you can come anytime and have fun in a comfortable manner.

120
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.210
No. That...

121
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.040
We're not that type of relation, Mother.

122
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.950
Ex-Excuse me, you should go. I'm sorry.

123
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.040
- Hey, hey, you did well. 
 - Mom!

124
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.230
- You did well. 
 - Please don't be like that.

125
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.110
- Let go of me for a bit. 
 - M-Mother!

126
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.090
- Aigoo, Mom, you should go inside and— 
 - I like him!

127
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:46.410
- Huh? 
 - That's right.

128
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.360
I... like Han Yisang.

129
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.880
Is that so?

130
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.330
So... don't worry.

131
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.260
Y-Y-Yes. Aigoo.

132
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:08.590
Aigoo, thank you. Thank you.

133
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.650
The taxi is coming. Let's meet again later.

134
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.500
Goodbye.

135
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.210
Yisang! I'm going!

136
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.550
- Why? 
 - Did you eat?

137
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.530
Are you crazy? Do you know what time it is?

138
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.550
- Have you had intestines? 
 - Why are you talking about intestines?

139
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.150
I'm craving them, but they don't come in single servings.

140
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.370
I said I already ate.

141
00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.880
So have some intestines.

142
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.420
Go on up, wash, and sleep. I stopped eating intestines.

143
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.210
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

144
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.550
<i>Why is it all so easy for you?</i>

145
00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.340
<i>No, it seemed like your mother was worrying too much, so—</i>

146
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.580
<i>Can you fall in love just by looking at someone?</i>

147
00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.510
<i>We aren't that—</i>

148
00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.050
<i>We're not young.</i>

149
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.970
<i> If we're not able to accept each other, we shouldn't start it.</i>

150
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.780
<i>Why is it so complicated?</i>

151
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.230
<i>Because I know the ending.</i>

152
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:23.270
<i>You... want a child.</i>

153
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.190
<i>I don't.</i>

154
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:36.790
<i>You getting hurt... I can't take responsibility for it.</i>

155
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.710
<i>Han Yisang...</i>

156
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.620
<i>I take responsibility for my own heart. </i>

157
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.610
<i> It seems I made a mistake because my feelings got ahead of me.</i>

158
00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:01.020
<i>So that I don't misunderstand in the future, please be careful, too. </i>

159
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.630
It must be the signs of a wretched fate.

160
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:30.690
You said you weren't going to eat.

161
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:32.380
You should have asked me to have a drink.

162
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.600
But I'm not going to drink.

163
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:38.830
How can you eat intestines without drinking soju?

164
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.370
I'll get drunk.

165
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:45.660
I don't know who it is, but a man who makes you worry isn't it.

166
00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.420
What man?

167
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.550
If not, then never mind.

168
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.710
Getting excited over that small thing... I was the only one.

169
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.440
That?

170
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.750
I had firmly made up my mind that I didn't need a man.

171
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.590
To lose rationality over that paltry little moment...

172
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:19.900
Perhaps... a kiss?

173
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:25.110
I lost my judgment since I haven't done it for a long time.

174
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:28.170
You slept with him?!

175
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:30.310
What nonsense are you spouting?

176
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.800
Quiet down!

177
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:40.070
If you didn't sleep with him, then never mind. I got so shocked.

178
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.820
With just a touch

179
00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:49.460
or a gaze, I become captivated. Even though I'm 40 soon.

180
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.510
I think it's best for you to live alone.

181
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.640
Why are you giving your whole heart away to a man who doesn't do anything?

182
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.910
Retrieve your heart.

183
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:13.170
It would've been different if we had been 20, right?

184
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:18.080
Even if we had met at 30, he wouldn't have been this hesitant.

185
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.640
Like how I don't have time...

186
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:26.820
he probably has a complicated reason.

187
00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.780
Why are you trying to understand him?!

188
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.790
What's so important about that man's situation?! You said you didn't have time.

189
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.890
You punk. Why didn't you talk to me when I'm a doctor?

190
00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.900
I didn't know pediatricians could deal with infertility.

191
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.740
We can all do counseling.

192
00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.140
Ah, seriously.

193
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:55.350
So what are you feeling? You said you didn't have time to date and then marry.

194
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.870
You said you've never been happy because of a man before in your life.

195
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:05.190
You still want to have expectations?

196
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.690
It's because I'm trying to fold my expectations that I'm hurting.

197
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:18.130
It would've been nice if I was 20 today.

198
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.060
So that I could at least try hanging onto him for giving me butterflies.

<i>[Episode 7: The Right Amount of Space to Prevent Heartbreak]</i>

200
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.830
You can just take the background out of focus.

201
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.010
There's no background to take out of focus.

202
00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.540
Are you insisting because you don't know?

203
00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:56.510
Don't you think we can do something like this with the props we have over there?

204
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.330
Isn't that up to your ability?

205
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:05.670
Bring in the right props first then. I don't need you to judge my ability to take photos, Reporter Choi.

206
00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:09.840
You sure make your work difficult when you can just take the photos as ordered.

207
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:14.060
Reporter Choi, let's keep our basic manners while working.

208
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.300
Looking down on others hardly hides your own lack of talent.

209
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:20.320
Chief Han.

210
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:26.970
Take the pictures by how the reporter in charge wants it.

211
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:40.760
From planning the article to getting the pictorial's concept to preparing the props, Reporter Choi did everything.

212
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.970
We'll make the final decision after seeing how the photos come out.

213
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.240
If we have to re-shoot, then you're uselessly working twice.

214
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.610
- Can the editing team use the photographing department's time and effort so thoughtlessly? 
 - That also...

215
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.650
leave that decision up to the reporter in charge.

216
00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.580
- Take care of it, please. 
 - Okay.

217
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.640
I took your side so that you could take responsibility.

218
00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.130
You know it, right? That you did wrong?

219
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.300
I couldn't let him have the upper hand when he's just an outside hire.

220
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.610
No matter how in-demand he is,

221
00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:29.960
shouldn't he listen to the reporter?

222
00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.540
Do you see me as your superior?

223
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.810
The photography and art teams are our partners, not underlings.

224
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.630
I feel sorry toward you.

225
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:47.190
Because I was afraid of being called an oldie, I didn't teach you the things that I should have.

226
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:50.650
Since it's obvious you won't like listening to me saying "do this, do that, don't do it."

227
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.270
My assumption that you would just learn by our example was a failure to do my duty.

228
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.960
I... don't plan on working here for a long time.

229
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.560
I know. You job search every day.

230
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.790
Is that why you're just doing your work half-ass?

231
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:08.580
I've never done my work half-ass. I try and do well.

232
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:12.240
Instead of pretending to do well, you should actually do well.

233
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.800
Working without pride will make the workplace seem like hell.

234
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:21.670
I'm going to start saying things you won't like. I also won't say things like, "This is enough."

235
00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.910
Until you produce better results, I won't stop hounding you.

236
00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.820
So that wherever you go, you'll receive an acknowledgment from what you learned here.

237
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.540
You can quit once you make a portfolio that you can show others proudly.

<i>Let's take a break.</i>

239
00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:52.920
I picked the photo for the infertile couple.

240
00:20:55.910 --> 00:21:00.200
They must have seen and learned from my frank manner of speaking to you.

241
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.940
I'm sorry I let them act thoughtlessly.

242
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.270
Okay.

243
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:19.310
Because of me...

244
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:24.640
I hope that your feelings haven't been hurt.

245
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.910
<i> It seems I made a mistake because my feelings got ahead of me.</i>

246
00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:36.690
<i>So that I don't misunderstand in the future, please be careful, too. </i>

247
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:00.680
I...

248
00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:08.210
broke off the engagement with a longtime girlfriend.

249
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:16.010
And... gave up on getting married. And a baby is not in my life.

250
00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:22.610
I didn't want my heart to flutter, but you began to sway me.

251
00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:28.190
My actions were unclear, and it's understandable why you took it the wrong way.

252
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.940
In the end, it was a misunderstanding.

253
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.660
I thought about it for a short time,

254
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.430
but I still like being alone.

255
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.350
I've thought about living alone for a long time,

256
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.540
so I've decided on the path that my life will take.

257
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.160
I'm sorry...

258
00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.340
for confusing you.

259
00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:05.810
I'll accept your apology.

260
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:08.500
You said you didn't want your heart to flutter, right? Same here.

261
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.390
Even though it was for a short time, I was uncomfortable having complicated feelings.

262
00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.500
Let's see each other comfortably.

263
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.240

I thought it would be best if you didn't get in trouble.

But... why do you keep getting told off?

I wasn't told off!

305

You just have a lot of anger, I see.

306
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:37.740
But... I was only going to say hello since you told me to,

but you keep talking to me first.

308

Are you... arguing about me talking to you first right now?

309
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:53.050
No, no, no. More than just saying hello, I like it better when we talk.

Then... shall we talk longer next time?

What is that smile? It really offends me. What are you asking for?

315
00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:28.220
To eat.

316
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.540
Why would you come all the way here and buy me food?

317
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.920
Because I hate eating alone. Let's go.

318
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.390
You look like you're scheming something.

319
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.270
Hurry up and come!

320
00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.310
Here.

321
00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.220
I don't have money.

322
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.180
I don't have time either. I can't do anything.

323
00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.360
I came to just eat a meal together.

324
00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.730
Relax your eyes and let's enjoy the food.

325
00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:02.390
I've thought about it after putting our 39 years of friendship on the line...

326
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:04.200
Are you a terminally ill patient?

327
00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.250
If so, I have no reason to not make your last wish come true.

328
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.630
I'll marry you.

329
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:21.780
Five minutes. No, think about it for a minute.

330
00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.580
It tastes good.

331
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.380
At least pretend to think about it.

332
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.290
<i>Honey, is the food almost ready?</i>

333
00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.430
<i>- Did you launder my socks? 
 - Socks?</i>

334
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:39.280
<i>I need my white shirt to be ironed stiffly for tomorrow.</i>

335
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:43.610
<i>I'm going to take a bath after eating, so set the water's temperature to 39.5 degrees Celsius. </i>

336
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:47.690
<i> I'm a bit sensitive.</i>

337
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.480
I've lost my appetite. Just hire a nice housekeeper!

338
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.110
Why do you hate it that much? Is it that much of a "no"?

339
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.580
Then, did you think it would be a yes?

340
00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:59.060
I'm thankful that you're worried for me, but why put our friendship on the line?

341
00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:03.360
What's wrong with you lately? Am I that pitiful?

342
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.690
I... these days...

343
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.120
am lonely.

344
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.820
Is it andropause? Do you feel lonely all of a sudden, feel empty without any reason, and feel like crying?

345
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:25.390
It's closer to puberty. Swinging from dislike to like, and feeling irritable all of a sudden.

346
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.860
That's why you have to look after me, so I don't go astray.

347
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:43.220
I'm looking at you now. Eat.

348
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:48.190
Thoroughly chew and eat. You'll get indigestion.

349
00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:55.680
Wait in here, please.

350
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.020
I don't know when the team leader will be back either.

351
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.960
She'll probably be here before she gets fired.

352
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.560
Ah, yeah...

353
00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.350
<i>[Resignation Form]</i>

354
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.580
<i>[I am no longer able to fulfill my work obligations due to childcare needs.] </i>

355
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.780
I wasn't telling you to resign,

356
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:38.660
more like temporary retirement.

357
00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:41.550
That, to me, are words for resignation.

358
00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.640
And... it's about time for me to quit.

359
00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.950
I should leave my spot for the younger ones to get promoted.

360
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.020
It's not like I can hold onto you since your child is sick.

361
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.800
Then... can you keep on coming till we find a replacement?

362
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.300
No.

363
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.550
I'm going to transfer my position to Deputy Editor Jang and quit right away.

364
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.120
Resigning suddenly like this

365
00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:14.830
doesn't mean she'll automatically be promoted to chief editor. Acting chief editor, at most.

366
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.760
I also... treasure Deputy Editor Jang.

367
00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:33.800
But the chairman's rage is so big that it'll be hard for Deputy Jang.

368
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.330
So... you should stay here until we find a replacement.

369
00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:40.830
Okay.

370
00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.990
Have a good day.

371
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.480
Hey, Joo Seungtae. 
 <i>(T/N: informal manner)</i>

372
00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:59.750
Be a loyal dog to the chairman, or take care of your subordinates. Pick one of the two.

373
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.180
Or do both well.

374
00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.540
Have a good day!

375
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:25.270
You were here?

376
00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.790
You didn't leave yet?

377
00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.840
I was at Cheonwang all day,

378
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:35.950
and couldn't see Team Leader Park. So I'm still here 'cause I didn't do anything today.

379
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.870
Were you just blindly waiting?

380
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:41.550
Did Manager Kim order you?

381
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.260
It's my work, so I have to figure it out.

382
00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:49.960
Deputy Editor, I learned a lot from your column.

383
00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.830
Learning is a bit...

384
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.740
- I should do well to maintain my private life. 
 - Hey.

385
00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:00.080
I also need to be more courageous.

386
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.620
I'm too young to determine if it was right or wrong,

387
00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:09.720
I just think you're amazing.

388
00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.930
About what?

389
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:17.860
I'm not sure about what I want to do, so I'm just floating about right now.

390
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.690
But you know exactly what you want.

391
00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.460
You're living your life.

392
00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.490
And it may be something that others might have never thought of,

393
00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:32.120
and it could be something that someone has thought about but couldn't do.

394
00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.890
You're cool.

395
00:34:35.890 --> 00:34:40.280
You're able to understand me?

396
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.600
Yes. Your dream isn't illegal.

397
00:34:47.910 --> 00:34:48.900
Go inside.

398
00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.140
Okay. Work hard.

399
00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.010
<i>[Advertising Team: CHOIKANG EUTTEUM]</i>

400
00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.320
What brings you here, Reporter Choi?

401
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.870
I'm exactly like Chow Yun Fat, right?

402
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:13.530
Wh- what fat?

403
00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:15.680
She doesn't know.

404
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.780
Has Mr. Eutteum not come to work yet?

405
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.670
He left for work to Cheonan.

406
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.750
Team Leader Park there... He's really something else.

407
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:27.340
If it's not beneficial for them, they don't pick up the phone or meet up with you.

408
00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.640
You sent Eutteum to that place?

409
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.370
Why? Can I not send him?

410
00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.850
Euttuem isn't someone who'll come back with something. He'll get scammed.

411
00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.400
You're sure saying nonsense.

412
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:43.170
Why is she...?

413
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.470
Yes, Hyojoo?

414
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.760
Are you going to keep on being there?

415
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.260
I'll have to wait. It's my work.

416
00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.280
Don't be like that and come back quickly!

417
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.240
What's going on?

418
00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.420
No, I said there's something.

419
00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:06.800
There's this, there's that. There's so much to do, so you should hurry and come back.

420
00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:15.710
Who is it? Eutteum?

421
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.760
Yes. He's still in Cheonan.

422
00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.290
He's so innocent. The guy won't even meet with him. He's indefinitely waiting.

423
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:27.600
Why did he send Eutteum to such a place?

424
00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.840
Anyway, isn't this not it?

425
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.930
Yeonwoo, did Cheonwang's proposal come out yet?

426
00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.780
Just a second.

427
00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:44.930
Is there a meeting? I reserved this room for 11.

428
00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:49.420
No, go ahead.

429
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.280
Work hard. Work hard.

430
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:09.460
I got your project proposition from Reporter Park. I don't think anything will be problematic.

431
00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.860
Uh...

432
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.220
Eutteum.

433
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:28.380
Oh? Why are you here, Deputy Editor?

434
00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:33.220
But the problem is right here.

435
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:41.320
Are subcontractors supposed to shut up and just do as they're told while being punished here like this?

436
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.590
We weren't punishing him, but—

437
00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:48.740
When you're a newcomer, you're always wary of your superiors and worry about all the mistakes you've made today.

438
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.000
And punish yourself wondering if you should be turning in a resignation letter.

439
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.750
They already get overwhelmed by the printer. They shouldn't have to worry about not receiving common courtesy from their coworkers.

440
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.930
I apologize.

441
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.280
We were busy and inconsiderate of you.

442
00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:11.930
Yes, Sir.

443
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:15.070
PD, you guys are leaving the work to us because you trust us. Right?

444
00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:18.770
We believe that we have a trusting relationship with Cheonwang.

445
00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.380
Let's keep getting along.

446
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.480
I'll put you through to the team leader right away.

447
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.450
Thank you.

448
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.190
Team Leader, just a moment.

449
00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.300
Hello, this is Deputy Editor Jang Hari from "the baby."

450
00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:40.470
I came because of the toothpaste,

451
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:44.200
but it seems like you're quite busy, so maybe I should just bring the matter to the chairman...

452
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:47.780
or maybe I could head up to the president's office?

453
00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.030
<i> Wow, you've done it!</i>

454
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.300
Oh! Chief!

455
00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.430
Han Yisang?

456
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.750
- Aren't you happy to see me?
 - Yeah.

457
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.430
What an over-the-top greeting.

458
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:14.970
You made a lot of money.

459
00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:16.790
I did.

460
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.030
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course.

461
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:24.340
He's not only at peace but laughs? Wow, he ignores my lips but hugs her like that?

462
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:32.230
I'm feeling nervous since I'm making a comeback after such a long time.

463
00:39:32.230 --> 00:39:35.660
Maybe it's because you became a mother, but your aura became a lot softer.

464
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.450
Really?

465
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.320
You look a lot better.

466
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:46.030
Oh my, you were here.

467
00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.080
Oh my, you were here.

468
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:59.380
I... drink fresh juice after eating my meal, you see.

469
00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.410
Ah... this is "the baby" magazine's Jang Hari.

470
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:07.420
You know her, right? Kang Yoojoo.

471
00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.770
- Kang Yoojoo. Yes, yes. 
 - Hello.

472
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:15.940
- It's nice to meet you. 
 - Chief Han Yisang and I are colleagues who are very comfortable with each other.

473
00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.700
I think it'll be great if you could be in our magazine one day.

474
00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.460
It'll be good!

475
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.880
Don't mind me and talk comfortably among yourselves.

476
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.020
She has a very bright personality.

477
00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:32.190
She looks like it. Speaking of, I got a pictorial offer.

478
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.470
I feel all this pressure. I've had two kids now and people are going to start talking.

479
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:42.230
That after all this time, my figure is saggy and my face is haggard. It would be the worst!

480
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.800
Pressure?

481
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:48.840
Back then or right now, Kang Yoojoo is at the top.

482
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.870
And that's precisely why I'm saying this.

483
00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:12.760
You should take my pictures.

484
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.450
I wouldn't be "taking" anything. It'll be an honor for me.

485
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:22.580
You know how much I like you. Please take the photos for me.

486
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:25.010
I really want you to take them.

487
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:31.360
From my younger days, you always made me pretty and my figure, since you understand all my angles.

488
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.140
No matter what the angles are, you're pretty.

489
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:39.910
It seems you are very close to Kang Yoojoo.

490
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:44.830
I've photographed her from the time of her debut, so that's how we got to be close.

491
00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:49.120
Since you're working with actresses, you must have high standards.

492
00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:56.210
I just like a women who is very pretty and petite enough,

493
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:58.140
while behaving very disgracefully.

494
00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:03.600
"Pretty?" Very pretty at that? And behaving disgracefully?

495
00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:10.110
You don't have to pick out the exact qualities I don't have to draw the line.

496
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.830
Well, no matter how much you think about it, I guess I'm not it, but I, too,

497
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:18.660
as brief as a cherry blossom that's blowing in the wind and as light as cotton,

498
00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.300
those were my feelings.

499
00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:26.240
See? Even if we lock eyes, I couldn't be more unbothered. It's so comfortable.

500
00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.160
But I'm uncomfortable.

501
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:35.330
I'm trying hard to comfortably see you. Since I have to see you.

502
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.940
You must really hate seeing me.

503
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.660
Then if possible, I'll film only with Sanghee.

504
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.110
I'm saying that I need to see you, even this way.

505
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.090
Deputy Editor.

506
00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:19.860
Eutteum, make sure the toothpaste sells out within three months.

507
00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.390
I asked you to finish the advertisement page. When will it be done?

508
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.040
Why are you looking at me like that?

509
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:40.860
Uh... I... thought about it very seriously and thoroughly.

510
00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.710
And I came to understand what you told me as I looked at your column.

511
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.190
Because you are really cool in my eyes,

512
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.480
and the person you are looking for is me,

513
00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.810
I'll give it to you!

514
00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:57.950
What?

515
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:02.220
Because of that, you became the Sperm Lady.

516
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.600
You wouldn't have gone through all that if you had a donor.

517
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.020
Of course, it's obvious you need a sperm to bear a child.

518
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.320
But after seeing you get humiliated,

519
00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.900
as someone who has a lot of sperm,

520
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.400
I can't stand still.

521
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.560
I t-t-think you can stop talking now.

522
00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.240
You must be shy. Then how about this?

523
00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:28.190
Why don't we call it Jungsoon or Jungsik instead? 
(T/N: Names that sound similar to "sperm" in Korean)

524
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.770
Wh-Why don't we stop talking about that. Stop.

525
00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.010
Why? You said you didn't have much time left.

526
00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:38.900
But I don't think this is it.

527
00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:42.740

Director, I'm going home now.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.420
All right, good work today.

<i>[Cardiothoracic Surgeon - Seo Jeongwon]</i>

Where is Doha? I'll go pick her up.

543
00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:49.100
I already told them I'd be late. I'll clean this up and go pick her up.

544
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.920
Suh Jeongwon?

545
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.860
Doha's mother?

546
00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:58.680
Do I have to let the residential center know before I throw away a plant?

547
00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:02.870
Why would you waste this? It looks expensive.

548
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.080
Even if you take it off, I'll know who sent it.

549
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:11.580
She sent this to bother you. So that you'll think of her when you see this.

550
00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.780
I need to get rid of it completely. So she won't do this again.

551
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.970
Look at that wench, Doha's mother.

552
00:47:17.970 --> 00:47:21.820
Of course, someone so smart and pretty would also be manipulative.

553
00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:34.720
Hold on... Did Youngok's store...

554
00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.050
Did they open?

555
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:50.310
We have to prepare for Doha's first birthday party.

556
00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.860
I think a cream-toned convention would be nice.

557
00:47:52.860 --> 00:47:57.920
Let's invite about 100 people. Are your parents coming from the U.S.?

558
00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.540
Didn't we get divorced?

559
00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:04.400
I agreed to receive child support payments and ended things.

560
00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.150
Why? Do you not want to give child support?

561
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:09.560
Then don't give it.

562
00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:15.820
Receive the child support. Let's do the celebration together. I'm Doha's mother.

563
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:26.680
Doha goes to daycare. She's been there less than a month, but she gets along with the other kids.

564
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.590
She eats so well, that if you give her rice in soup, she'll eat a whole bowl.

565
00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:39.050
At first, she said "ba ba," but now she says, "appa" (dad).

566
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.080
But she doesn't say "umma" (mom).

567
00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.560
You should be asking about the child's wellbeing.

568
00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:00.740
If you're her mother, you should be asking if she's healthy,

569
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.240
if she's eating well, if she's sleeping okay.

570
00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:08.150
You should worry about that first.

571
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:15.960
You're not Doha's mother. I'll take care of her first birthday party.

572
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:18.350
I've gotten better now.

573
00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:24.060
I came here because I want to get better. I've never not loved you.

574
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:32.770
You've never not been selfish,

575
00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:42.210
but giving up on Hari and choosing you, I was stupid.

576
00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.500
Did she insert herself into our relationship?

577
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.460
No.

578
00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:56.880
You... inserted yourself into Hari's and my relationship.

579
00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.520
We're done washing up now.

580
00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.570
Oh, how refreshing!

581
00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.650
Give Doha to me and go eat.

582
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.480
I ate so much for lunch that I'm still full. You eat, Auntie.

583
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.330
Just eat a little bit.

584
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:28.600
I'm fine. I'm going to go rest!

585

<i>All right, let's go to sleep.</i>

586
00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.370
No matter how much they hate each other,

587
00:50:38.370 --> 00:50:42.630
a baby needs a mother's love.

588
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:56.730
My Doha's so pretty all washed up!

589
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.990
Who do you take after that you're so pretty?

590
00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.230
What? Daddy?

591
00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:07.240
Doha... now you're going to daycare,

592
00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:12.030
and growing well even living with Daddy, so thank you.

593
00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:17.950
It was rough because we were left alone, remember?

594
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:22.410
But we learned how to live with what we had, right?

595
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:28.220
So now Daddy, Grandma, and Aunt Hari

596
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.960
will love you even more.

597
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:35.150
You'll be fine without a mom.

598
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:41.190
Moving forward, let's do well just the two of us.

599

Hello! Hello!

600
00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:58.090
I came to ask about the sizing for the Book &amp; Book.

601
00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:01.350
Could I search the manager's desk?

602
00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:02.520
Yes, go ahead.

603
00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:04.370
Thank you!

604
00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:12.670
Did the company have a predetermined size that's different from the previous Book &amp; Book sizes?

605
00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:17.100
Yes, they told me they sent it to her, but I don't see it.

606
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.360
Take a look at her notebook.

607
00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:29.150
She sent it to me via email.

608
00:52:29.150 --> 00:52:31.490
I'll forward it to you.

609
00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.150
All right.

610
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:37.670

614
00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.350

615
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:00.190
I have even better news.

616
00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:04.640
What is it? Are we getting a bonus?

617
00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.900
Yes, I'll give you a prize.

618
00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:09.020
I'm quitting.

619
00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.560

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.710
Were you guys craving something spicy, too?

627
00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.810
I love tteokboki! But why are you guys craving something spicy?

628
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.000
Who stressed my reporters out?!

629
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.250
The editor-in-chief is quitting.

630
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.180
Why?

631
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:09.370
Our editor has loyalty.

632
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:10.930
Only you guys didn't know.

633
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:14.460
Only you knew that because she favored you.

634
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.810
I thought she only disliked you.

635
00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:19.440
Hari, you must be disappointed.

636
00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:24.350
You might as well be in a coma.

637
00:54:24.350 --> 00:54:27.930
This is perfect. Spicy and yummy.

638
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:31.360
It's a big deal because your boss' newborn is sick.  Enjoy your meal.  Okay?

639
00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:33.380
Goodnight!

640
00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.730
Senior, please...

641
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.590
Oh, this is so delicious.

642
00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:40.300
That's what I'm saying.

643
00:54:40.300 --> 00:54:41.670
Please give me one more!

644
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:44.080
Ignore that last order.

645
00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.410
I told you to eat the mild one.

646
00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:57.780
The baby model from yesterday... I uploaded the B-cuts to the Web-Hard service.

647
00:54:57.780 --> 00:55:00.960
Thank you. That's a gift in place of the performance pay.

648
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.850
The moms are probably going to be happy.

649
00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.380
Stop eating that.

650
00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.050
I'll be off!

651
00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.540
Goodnight!

652
00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.990
Oh, spicy!

653
00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:22.630
What? Where are you going?

654
00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.620
Mr. Han Yisang!

655
00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:47.000
What are you trying to do right now?

656
00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:53.380
You drew the line. Then you shouldn't cross it.

657
00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:58.560
Showing your feelings but not acting on it is hurtful to me, too.

658
00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:03.840
Don't continue confusing me or shaking me up.

659
00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:13.360
It wasn't light-hearted... and it wasn't easy for me to stop.

660
00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:18.530
I... was clumsy.

661
00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:22.860
Because there's no "next" for us?

662
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:31.940
The reason why I decided we can't was because of my issues.

663
00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:36.450
So... I hope that you don't think it was because of you.

664
00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:41.890
Not being greedy when I can't take responsibility...

665
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:45.930
I believed I was being considerate and respectful towards you.

666
00:56:47.970 --> 00:56:51.290
That's probably the extent of your feelings.

667
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:56.350
If it's right to cut things off coldly, I'll give that a shot.

668
00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:59.360
I'm sorry.

669
00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:06.260
♫ <i>I'm still with you, in the same moment</i> ♫

670
00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:13.760
♫ <i>I'm still with you, I want to stay by your side</i> ♫

671
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:19.600
♫ <i>Goodbye, all my painful days </i> ♫

672
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.620
♫ <i>Goodbye, all my lonely days </i>♫

673
00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:29.140
♫ <i>Goodbye</i> ♫

674
00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:36.720
<i>If it's right to cut things off coldly, I'll give that a shot.</i>

675
00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.790
Senior! Did you find what you were looking for?

676
00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:43.940
Yeah, pretty much.

677
00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:49.440
To think the chief editor would resign because of her kid.

678
00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:52.280
I don't think I would be able to handle it if my kids were sick.

679
00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:56.480
The more I think about it, the more I think it was a good choice not to have kids.

680
00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:02.320
You don't think you'll ever change your mind about it, Yunho?

681
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.330
The two of us are living well and happily, so why?

682
00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:11.090
While I don't want my life to be dictated by having a child, the biggest hurdle is financial, realistically.

683
00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:15.660
See, you'd have to pay the child's tuition until graduation and chip in for their wedding.

684
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.150
What if you just get old while struggling to buy a house and supporting your kid?

685
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:22.680
My husband and I won't be able to earn or have fun.

686
00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.420
We've never wanted kids, so the suggestion that we should is an act of aggression.

687
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.020
I see how that could be.

688
00:58:34.690 --> 00:58:38.100
How's the project going? You should just seduce and marry him.

689
00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.010
What marriage?

690
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:48.120
I'm scared now that he wants to give it to me. I feel sorry, too.

691
00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.920
Is it 'cause he's so young?

692
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.880
He's slow-witted and always happy.

693
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.950
What? It's Eutteum?!

694
00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:01.400
Look at you being so quick-witted.

695
00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.630
Keep it a secret.

696
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:06.800
It wasn't Chief Han?

697
00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.990
No, it's not him.

698
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:10.680
Eutteum is way too young.

699
00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.050
Me being too old is the problem.

700
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:17.420
I didn't know being old was something to be this sad over.

701
00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.150
I don't know anymore why my feelings are like this.

702
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.370
I can't tell him either.

703
00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:34.510
What's this? What do I do?

704
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:36.310
What do I do?

705
00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.070
Okay.

706
00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.390
That's what I'm saying.

707
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:50.890
- Oh! 
- It's amazing.

708
00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:53.920
How long has it been?

709
01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.930
Attention, attention.

710
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:04.520
Okay, what event is this?

711
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.470
- Chief Editor's...
 - Farewell party!

712
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:10.940
Yes, yes. We are so excited.

713
01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.350
Since the juniors are like this, the chief editor may feel very sad.

714
01:00:14.350 --> 01:00:16.930
So we should listen to her last words, right?

715
01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:19.330
- I'm going to take back my resignation letter. 
 - I'll skip this part then.

716
01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:22.450
Okay. In order to happily send her off,

717
01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:25.070
we have prepared a huge present.

718
01:00:25.070 --> 01:00:28.210
Okay, enter the present. Woohoo!

719
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.240
Receive it!

720
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.280
Go out.

721
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.190
What do you mean, go out?

722
01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:51.100
<i>[the baby]</i>

723
01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.070
We made it out of all the precious articles you've written.

724
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:04.750
To use as a portfolio when you come back out of retirement.

725
01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.720
Thank you.

726
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:09.420
Why is the atmosphere like this?

727
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.270
Sing.

728
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:14.990
Sing! Sing! Sing—

729
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:18.290
Let's stop. Stop.

730
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.560
Gosh, I feel like dying.

731
01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.850
- I'm not leaving. The person who leaves is a traitor. 
 - You're right.

732
01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:48.810
Rock, paper, scissors!

733
01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:52.280
No one is allowed to go home after this, okay?

734
01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.680
I knew this would happen.

735
01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:12.130
Why are you packing your stuff during your farewell party?

736
01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:13.510
Because I don't want to come out tomorrow.

737
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:16.920
You were going to leave without saying goodbye because you're embarrassed?

738
01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:22.660
Come out tomorrow. Let's eat lunch together and let us see you off.

739
01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:27.130
It's bothersome. You should go and take care of them. They're probably drunk.

740
01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.920
I don't want to. I want to take care of you.

741
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:35.730
Being nice is also a disease. Don't try and take in everybody once you're the chief editor.

742
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:37.260
You need to be mean when you need to.

743
01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.150
I don't even know if they'll give me that position.

744
01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:43.160
If they don't, tell me. I'll come with my baby.

745
01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.430
It seems you'll really come.

746
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.000
Are you not going to follow?

747
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:55.290
Let's go together.

748
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.370
Hurry!

749
01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:04.620
Are you really just going to leave?

750
01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:08.190
At least say goodbye. Since it's the last.

751
01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:10.970
Shall I cry while hugging them tightly?

752
01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.510
Wouldn't it be embarrassing if I see them again?

753
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:17.960
That's true. It'll be very embarrassing!

754
01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:23.800
- Chief editor. Chief editor!
 - Hey.

755
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.090
I'm going to hit you.

756
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.730
I'm thankful for you.

757
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:42.340
Very... much.

758
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.820
Me too.

759
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:50.700
Thank you.

760
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.700
You called a driver?

761
01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:57.130
Yes.

762
01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.420
What are we doing?

763
01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.320
<i>Why are you leaving?</i>

764
01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:54.630
Oh, it's Hari!

765
01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.750
Let's go for round two.

766
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:59.400
We have to go for round two!

767
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.720
Ow!

768
01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.510
Go home! Hurry!

769
01:05:04.510 --> 01:05:05.710
This car is round two.

770
01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.260
You all head in first.

771
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.550
I'll take care of everything,

772
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.720
so go for the second round.

773
01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.820
Goodbye!!!

774
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:16.260
<i>Wait!</i>

775
01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:17.520
<i>Let's go!</i>

776
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:18.880
I have to pay.

777
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.300
Into this car for round two!

778
01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:26.990
You're not supposed to get in the car that way.

779
01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.480
Hang on.

780
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:30.330
- Stay here. 
 - General Manager!

781
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.660
Get in.

782
01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.790
Eutteum! Get a hold of yourself.

783
01:05:35.790 --> 01:05:39.050
Deputy Editor, I have something to say...

784
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:41.060
Mr. Eutteum, snap out of it. Are you okay?

785
01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:43.140
I'll take care of things on this end.

786
01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:44.640
You go and help them inside.

787
01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.790
I'll help over here so you can go there.

788
01:05:46.790 --> 01:05:49.490
Chief, help us here.

789
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:53.390
I have something to say to Deputy Editor.

790
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:54.630
I'll-I'll figure something out.

791
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:55.820
Just get in.

792
01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:59.610
I... have something to confess...

793
01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:03.020
Mr. Eutteum, you know who I am, right?

794
01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:05.160
- You're my aunt. 
 - What?

795
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.020
Deputy Editor!

796
01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:12.110
Get a hold of yourself.

797
01:06:12.110 --> 01:06:13.570
All right!

798
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.030
I shouldn't get in this car.

799
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:20.530
Excuse me, I called a taxi, so we're gonna go wait over there. You take care of them there.

800
01:06:20.530 --> 01:06:22.770
Okay, okay.

801
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:26.600
- My car, my car. 
 - It's this one.

802
01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:29.280
But this isn't my car! My car is a—

803
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.400
You're going to round two.

804
01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:33.500
- Mr. Eutteum. 
 - I have something to say.

805
01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.330
Sit, sit.

806
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.420
I'm going crazy.

807
01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.420
Go!

808
01:06:58.530 --> 01:07:00.760
I understand how you feel.

809
01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:04.750
Tell me how hard it was for you.

810
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:07.740
A junior who is 12 years younger...

811
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:10.960
Why do you age?

812
01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:14.700
Age? You're crazy.

813
01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:20.370
Don't worry anymore. I made up my mind.

814
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:23.090
Why isn't he coming?

815
01:07:23.090 --> 01:07:25.390
That's not important.

816
01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:34.660
Ah, why do I look like such a mess?

817
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:39.830
Are you trying to look good in front of me?

818
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:44.200
What?

819
01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.120
I also... want to look good in front of you.

820
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.140
Ah, seriously.
