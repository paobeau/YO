Don't. This blindfold feels quite comfortable on. You guys start solving first.

Is it simple? Why do I find it quite difficult?

35
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.600
That's because your IQ has a problem.

Look. Even Zhao Fanzhou doesn't understand it.

- Yes, we did.

I'd also like to ask...

68
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.100
I'm sorry. I won't be taking any photos for today.

69

Is she your girlfriend?

89
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.280
I thought you told other people that you were single.

She's not my girlfriend, so it's best not to let this affect her.

Didn't you say that you were a fan of Li Xiaofeng?

96

108
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.700
But in the end, I couldn't even get through the door to the lab.

109
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.220
I wanted to pretend to be a dead body to scare you guys.

110
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.410
It's a pity that the game just ends here.

111
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.800
We can still continue the game.

112
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:38.110
That's not right. Based on my understanding of Zhou Xiao,

113
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:40.700
the clue should be pointing to the balloons.

114
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.490
But these all don't have any marks.

115
00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.030
Could they be inside the balloon?

116
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.940
What is wrong with you?

117
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.030
Just believe me for once. It's definitely inside them.

118
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.880

119
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.730
Let's go.

120
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.260
Crazy!

121
00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.860
What is this?

122
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.510
It's a bone goniometer.

123
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.750
What is it used for?

124
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:22.660
They are often used in forensic clinics,

125
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.730
to measure the degree of damage of a patient's joints.

126
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.200
Patient?

127
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.670
I thought you guys only dealt with dead bodies.

128
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:35.370
Most of the day-to-day work of forensic scientists consists of the identification of injuries.

129
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.530
In contrast to what most people think, our work is not only about dealing with dead bodies.

Thanks, Teacher Zhao, for this lesson.

Are you finished playing? Let's go now.

132

We don't usually allow outsiders inside the labs.

133
00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.740
Wait a moment.

134
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.630
Since you already let me in,

135
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.620
why don't you grant me one more wish?

136
00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.900
Come and take a photo with me. Come on!  Let's take one together.

141
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.700

142
00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.850

Let's go.

145

Y-You... How did you guys come in here?

146
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.330
We just came in. We're about to do an experiment.

147

149
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.370

156

Am I only lacking this one credit? I'm lacking in all credits!

157
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.890

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.900
- It's appetizing.  
 -  All you think about is stimulating your appetite.

160
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.900
- It's tasty. What are we going to eat later? 
 - What do you want to eat?

161
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:07.740
<i>I want to eat fried chicken,</i>

162
00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.250
- Dormitory Creativity Contest. 
<i> - Barbecue and sushi.</i>

163
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:13.720
- All dormitories are required to participate. 
<i> - I also want spicy soup. What should I do? I want to eat them all.</i>

164
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.270
<i>Are you a pig? All you care about is eating.</i>

165
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.850
<i>My mom said that it's a blessing to eat.</i>

166
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.560
Wei-wei,

167
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.210
did you hear about the Dormitory Creativity Contest?

168
00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.980
Yes, of course. I was the one who stuck this up.

169
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.370
Let's have a discussion on what we plan to do.

170
00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.180
All right.

171
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.570
Look at it. What should we do?

172
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.820
Don't count on me.

173
00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.600
I've caught the attention of the senior sister again. I need to go to the art exhibition

174
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.800
and work as a slave. I'm leaving.

175
00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.470
I've got an idea, Sisters.

176
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:55.530
This facial mask just gave me some inspiration. Restoring the natural tender state of your skin.

177
00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:58.910
How about we go with the theme of "all-natural without any additives."

178
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:01.170
We don't need to do anything. Just enter the competition bare-faced.

179
00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.310
And maybe, among all the girls with a full face of makeup,

180
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.770
we'll be able to stand out.

181
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.500
Not doing anything? I agree.

182
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.770
Don't be like this. After all, there's one academic credit.

183
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.260
Wei-wei, you're grades are already so good. Why bother for this little bit of credit?

184
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.450
I want to earn all my credits early,

185
00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.220
so it will be easier for me to choose my second major.

186
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.450
We're still freshmen. You're thinking way ahead of us.

187
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.090
I don't care. I'm so tired. I don't want to do it.

188
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.390
This is such an easy way to earn credit.

189
00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:38.250
It's easier compared to waking up early in the morning to attend an electives course. Am I right?

190
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.070
That makes sense.

191
00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.470
- Let's have a good think about it then.  
  - Okay.

192
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.900
- Go get changed right now. Our modern literature class is starting soon. 
 - Okay.

193
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.700
Old Zhou!

194
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.620
Old Zhou!

195
00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.060
Look at this.

196
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.470
What are you doing? Did you not see that there is a dormitory evaluation?

197
00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.060
I saw it. And so?

198
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.940
We need to prepare for it.

199
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.080
The dormitory evaluation is also a type of contest. As long as it's a contest,

200
00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.740
I need to get first place.

201
00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.990
How are you going to win?

202
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.320
How to get it... Well...

203
00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:24.560
First of all, we need to clean up.

204
00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.150
And after that, we can make some arrangements.

205
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:31.530
Right? And in the end, we can decorate it in a MUJI (minimalist) style.

206
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.490
You'll definitely like it.

207
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.760
Okay, then good luck.

208
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.680
Good Luck!

209
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.020
Why am I the only one cleaning?

210
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.880
<i>- Come on, try and hit me. 
 - I'm going to hit you.</i>

211
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.870
We'll be doing material evidence testing in the lab next class.

212
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.670
Prepare the lab, before the next class begins.

213
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.350
I understand, Professor.

214
00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:01.120
Shi Guoguo, can I switch seats with you?

215
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.600
Why? Don't you usually sit in that seat?

216
00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.170
Well... When I was sleeping yesterday night, the right—

217
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.590
no the left side of my neck got stiff.

218
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:15.930
It's more convenient for me to see the board from your seat.

219
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:18.300
It hurts.

220
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.590
All right then.

221
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.000
Is it that serious?

222
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.100
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

223
00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.570
<i>The professor is coming. </i>

224
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.970
Let's begin our class.

225
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:54.590
The main tasks of Forensic Evidence Science are

226
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:58.120
Individual identification and paternal testing.

227
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.100
<i>From these,</i>

228
00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.560
<i>Individual Identification covers the</i>

229
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.880
<i>examination of bloodstains,</i>

230
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.070
<i>examination of saliva stains, the examination of hair, the examination of teeth,</i>

231
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.040
<i>the examination of bones, and so on.</i>

232
00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.740
<i>Next class will be held in the lab.</i>

233
00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.000
<i>I will be teaching you how to conduct these examinations.</i>

234
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:25.200
The world allows the existence of long stories that are very incomplete.

235
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.800
But towards short stories,

236
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.420
they are much more strict.

237
00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.990
<i>Now, I want you to turn to page 21 of the textbook.</i>

238
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.520
Wei-wei,

239
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.190
I have an idea. Why don't we decorate our dormitory

240
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.110
in a traditional Chinese style?

241
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.020
- That sounds good. 
  - Is it okay?

242
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.900
Okay.

243
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.590
Who else would think of a traditional Chinese style?  I'm so smart.

244
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.340
Then, how are we going to arrange our dormitory in a traditional Chinese style?

245
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.670
We can just buy some writing brushes, ink sticks, paper and inkstones,

246
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.190
landscape paintings, Chinese knots,

247
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.170
antithetical couplets, Chinese paper-cuttings.

248
00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.920
It should be good enough if we just buy some traditional Chinese elements.

249
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.820
Then to save time, why don't we split up to buy them.

250
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.630
I'll buy some white gauze curtains so we can unify the style of our mosquito nets with the room.

251
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.500
It just so happens that I need to accompany Fang Wei to buy some study materials.

252
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.340
I'll buy the writing brushes, ink sticks, paper and inkstones.

253
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.320
What should I do then?

254
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:38.900
Why don't you go to the supermarket and see if they have anything with a traditional Chinese style that

255
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:40.700
can match with our elements.

256
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.450
Okay.

257
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.740
<i>There's a dormitory evaluation coming up, I need to hide my mini projector. </i>

258
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.750
<i>Give me the keys to the Detective Club!!!</i>

259
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:55.090
Zhao Fanzhou, what are you doing?

260
00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.870
- Where are you going?  
  - The supermarket.

261
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.900
I'm also going there. Let's go together.

262
00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:01.370
Hop on.

263
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.750
Hurry up.

264
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.180
Were you looking for me?

265
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.640
That's probably not it. I've already paid you this month.

266
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:23.960
We also don't have any club activities.

267
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.800
There's no reason for you to look for me.

268
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.140
The Southern University campus must be quite small. Why do I keep on bumping into you?

269
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.400
I was looking for you.

270
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.220
Why were you looking for me? I—

271
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:36.340
Open up my bag.

272
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:42.440
Did you put a bomb inside your bag?

273
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.380
Hurry up.

274
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.800
<i>[Life on Mars? by Kotaro Isaka]</i>

275
00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.160
It's Kotaro Isaka's new book!

276
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.990
They translated it so quickly.

277
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:04.920
How did you get it?

278
00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:23.460
<i>["Life on Mars?" by Kotaro Isaka]
[Southern University Library]</i>

279
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.450
The library ordered it and it just arrived. There's only one copy.

280
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:44.100
I happened to see it so I just borrowed it for you.

281
00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:46.590
Who knew you were born with such a cold face,

282
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.950
but you're actually quite warm.

283
00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.970
Thank you. Let's go.

284
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.900
Honestly speaking, although you don't like to speak, you're very reliable.

285
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.130
Unlike Cai Yasi, that trash. All he does is bring me trouble every day.

286
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.390
- Are you guys warming up? 
 - Coach.

287
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.480
Chen Yu.

288
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.160
You're here.

289
00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.590
Where's Xiao Lu?

290
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.090
Is she not coming to train?

291
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:18.420
She came here in the morning.

292
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:23.080
I think she's helping out at an art exhibition held by her department this afternoon.

293
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.590
She didn't think to request a leave from the coach.

294
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:27.970
She doesn't treat me seriously at all.

295
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.300
She already asked me.

296
00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.230
She even invited us to go see the exhibition if we're free.

297
00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.910
Why don't we skip training as well?

298
00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.540
Let's go to the exhibition together.

299
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.110
Xiao Lu specifically emphasized that you shouldn't go.

300
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.450
She said that if you were to go, you would make a big fuss, and affect the atmosphere of the exhibition.

301
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.350
She doesn't want me to go, but I insist on going.

302
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.370
Classmate, please don't touch it.

303
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:12.470
It seems quite interesting, right?

304
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.740
Bro, aren't you tired?

305
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.280
Don't mention it. I'm exhausted to death.

306
00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.510
Bro, where did the lady go?

307
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.290
Are you also here to see her?

308
00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.810
Everyone is accompanying her to get some water.

309
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.220
Who is she?

310
00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.210
She even needs other people to accompany her to get some water?

311
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.500
If it weren't for the fact that I need to stand here, I would also accompany her.

312
00:26:44.370 --> 00:26:46.240
Why are you here?

313
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.620
I...

314
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:51.860
I'm here to see the exhibition. Is there a problem?

315
00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.570
Excuse me.

316
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.740
Bro, can you do me a favor?

317
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.050
This should be enough.

318
00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.910
Let me hold one.

319
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:21.580
It's all right.

320
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.930
Just let me carry one.

321
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.150
These are all mine. If I don't hold it, I'll feel burdened.

322
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:30.060
There's no need.

323
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:36.170
Oh right!  These things are all mine.

324
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:39.190
Don't you also need to buy anything? Why didn't you get anything?

325
00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:42.500
Go and collect our bags.

326
00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:48.130
Okay.

327
00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:02.740
So weird.

328
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:25.580
Let's go.

329
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:29.990
Zhao Fanzhou.

330
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.510
Zhao Fanzhou.

331
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.470
What are you doing?

332
00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.940
<i>[Press the button to store your belongings]</i>

333
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.150
Wait a minute. This one must be it.

334
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.180
Don't worry.

335
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:03.630
Why aren't you closing the door?

336
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.360
Yes.

337
00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:19.910
Let's go. My roommates are telling me to hurry.

338
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.630
I'm exhausted.

339
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.720
Let me lean on this for a bit, all right?

340
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.700
Go and stand properly.

341
00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.530
Do you have any sense of work ethic?

342
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.860
Why don't you come here and try it yourself.

343
00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.830
Try to keep standing still while holding a flute.

344
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.970
It's way more tiring than you think.

345
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.440
If you're so tired, why did you offer to take his place in the first place?

346
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.280
That's because your classmate said that his stomach hurt.

347
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.520
I'm not the type of person to avoid helping someone in need.

348
00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.970
He was faking it.

349
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:06.830
You're the third victim.

350
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:08.790
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

351
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.430
Weren't you having a great time acting as a hero?

352
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:14.850
If I had told you earlier, wouldn't that spoil all your fun?

353
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.860
Why are you like this?

354
00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.120
Are you Xie Yixing?

355
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.120
Yes, I am.

356
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:25.620
Why are you here?

357
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.920
I'm here to help out.

358
00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.220
So, you're also interested in the arts?

359
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.300
I saw comments by the keyboard warriors online who were criticizing you for being simple-minded.

360
00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.520
I should post this evidence online to show everyone how outstanding you truly are.

361
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.550
Okay. Wait a moment. Come to this side.

362
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:40.580
My left profile looks better. Come on.

363
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.310
Wait a moment.

364
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.720
Thank you.

365
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.530
You're welcome.

366
00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:50.200
Did you see that?  This popularity.

367
00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.880
It's my strength.

368
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:55.550
Let me take a photo of you.

369
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:06.950
Thank you.

370
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.620
What are you doing?

371
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:21.150
I just don't believe that you can stay still this whole time.

372
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.420
Pull down the legs of your pants first. They shouldn't be like that.

373
00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:28.130
I don't want to. That wouldn't be stylish.

374
00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.580
Classmate, come take pictures.

375
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.950
Do you want to take some? Come.

376
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:34.880
Buy one get one free!  Hurry. Come!

377
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.540
Let's take pictures.

378
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.050
Classmate!

379
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.920
Classmate, you came at the right time. Come.

380
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.780
Come, no problem.

381
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.530
Take a picture of the lady and get a free picture of the young man. Come, hurry.

382
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.400
Take out your phone. Come on.

383
00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.160
Here, use this hand.

384
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.970
One more.

385
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.750
It looks a bit messy.

386
00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:03.870
Like how it is during New Year's at my house.

387
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.050
How about we simplify it a bit?

388
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.310
Simpler is better.

389
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.900
What about a style of landscape paintings?

390
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.690
Everything will be black and white.

391
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:21.140
That should look less messy.

392
00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.750
That's not bad.

393
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.950
It sounds pretty artistic.

394
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:29.640
Alternating black and white?

395
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:32.470
Classy. I approve!

396
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.100
Then let's do it.

397
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.670
- Okay. 
- Okay.

398
00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.960
How much longer do we have to stand here?

399
00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.720
Hey.

400
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.260
Are you asleep?

401
00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.380
Black and white?

402
00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.930
Classy?

403
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:07.740
Why are the results not the same as our expectations?

404
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.260
Don't you think it looks a little frightening?

405
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.410
Like that...

406
00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.200
Don't say it out loud.

407
00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.290
- You know what I'm talking about? 
- Yes.

408
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:29.620
Everyone, why has our dorm become a mourning hall?

409
00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.800
It's not that bad.

410
00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:34.020
It's just a more serious Chinese traditional style.

411
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.280
Right. Don't say it's as scary as a mourning hall.

412
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:40.660
I think we can call this...

413
00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:44.390
- "Punk style." 
 - Punk style.

414
00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:59.810
Why did you guys make a mourning hall?

415
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.270
Hurry and get rid of it.

416
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.000
Look at other people's dorms.

417
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.270
They are pink and soft and pleasant on the eyes.

418
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.560
Look at yours.

419
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.270
Why did you make a mourning hall?

420
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.670
How is this like a girls' dorm?

421
00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:19.290
Auntie, there are no rules saying girls' dorms have to be pink and soft.

422
00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.810
- Right. 
 - Exactly.

423
00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.780
I'm just reminding you for your own good.

424
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.590
You can't get the prize like this.

425
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.340
We will definitely win.

426
00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:33.000
If we do it, we will do what's different from other people.

427
00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.330
Right.

428
00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.350
Right.

429
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.650
Fine, fine. Whatever suits you.

430
00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.540
You're not even scared that it's ominous to live like this.

431
00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:46.460
Bye, Auntie.

432
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.890
It's finally time for our Sister Lu to show what she's got.

433
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.760
It's great. I'm finally done.

434
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.580
What kind of style is different from what other people are doing?

435
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.090
Let's do one of those horror concepts.

436
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:07.840
I'll go and design it first.

437
00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.490
Sketch as you please.

438
00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.100
Sketch as you please.

439
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.940
I'll buy whatever decorations you need.

440
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.290
You sound so enthusiastic.

441
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:18.200
We haven't even eaten dinner yet. Let's think about what to eat.

442
00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.830
That's right.

443
00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.180
Yasi, why are you still using high-output appliances?

444
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.550
The dorm evaluation is soon.

445
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:28.300
Right, Yasi. Hurry and put away that thing.

446
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:30.360
I have to put them at the Detective Club tomorrow.

447
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:34.230
I'm relishing our last moments together today.

448
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.700
Then can you hide my mini-fridge there, too?

449
00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.460
Sure.

450
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.260
Thanks. Hurry and eat.

451
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.810
Hey, you. You haven't answered my messages for the whole day.

452
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.900
When are you going to open the door for me tomorrow?

453
00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.140
Hey, you–

454
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.640
You bought these lousy things again?

455
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.770
No wonder you've used up your scholarship money.

456
00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:12.820
Be gentle.

457
00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.650
This projector is so expensive. You won't be able to pay me back if you break it.

458
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:24.580
I won't let you put your things at the Detective Club with that attitude.

459
00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.840
Then it has to be fine if I treat you to a meal at the cafeteria, right?

460
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.770
I don't care.

461
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.430
Let me play with your projector.

462
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.580
Gentle.

463
00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.240
Then take them back.

464
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.440
How do you use this?

465
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:50.410
Turn on the projector, connect to your phone, and project onto a white wall.

466
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.990
I see. Then I'll try it.

467
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.440
Where should I put it?

468
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.620
You have to put it in a higher place. I'll do it.

469
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.740
I can do it myself. I'll do it.

470
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:00.740
- Then be gentle. 
 - Don't mind my business.
