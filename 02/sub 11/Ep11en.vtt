<i>Anchovy Dashi Noodles</i>

4
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.090
It's a story that begins with my father.

5
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.500
When I was in the military, I received news

6
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.080
that my father had taken his own life.

7
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.670
He betrayed his peers who were like family to him.

8
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.550
Behind his back, they called him an informant of the corporations that were tearing down labor unions.

9
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.020
He was tormented by being called a mole.

10
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.150
He sued the company for unfair labor practices. <i>Episode 11</i>

11
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.910
We stopped that last time.

12
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.130
Yes. The prosecution returned the charges for dissolution of the union

13
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.310
and unjust layoffs back to him.

14
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.660
Thanks to that, not only the dismantled labor unions

15
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:27.280
but also all the fired workers, in turn, sued him.

16
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.040
As a result, all the lawsuits against the company were revoked,

17
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.160
and he was prosecuted for illegal destruction of labor unions.

18
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.000
Ultimately, that man committed suicide,

19
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.050
but I have confirmed that was Vice President Han Jae Hyeon's father.

20
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.210
It was the world's loneliest funeral.

21
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.540
<i>1996</i> 
 Nobody came.

22
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.540
It was like my father had been abandoned.

23
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.600
Why did he make that decision?

24
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.590
My mother and I, neither of us knew anything

25
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.550
until we saw all those bills of complaint in his work bag.

26
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.200
Legal Complaint

27
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.220
All the people who didn't come to the funeral were in those bills of complaint.

28
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.520
The labor union broke down because of my father.

29
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.730
They were fired because they trusted in my father.

30
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.650
They were certain my father had gotten money from the company,

31
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.560
so they requested a thorough examination.

32
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.400
The road that my father had traveled down his whole life,

33
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.190
and... the road that I follow him down. I was disillusioned by it.

34
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.030
How could I live on from here? What should I live for?

35
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.120
I decided then.

36
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.610
How could you just find out about that now?

37
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.390
We worried that person's incident would be linked to the company's doing,

38
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.580
so we recorded that he had resigned and gotten rid of his files.

39
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.130
We weren't able to find that information when we were conducting our background checks on Vice President Han Jae Hyeon.

40
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.820
I'm sorry, Sir.

41
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.890
Since when has Jae Hyeon known about this?

42
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.520
Did he approach Seo Kyeong knowing this information?

43
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.190
I don't think that's the case.

44
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.480
According to the information systems department reports, the first time VP Han had looked

45
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.700
at the classified labor documents was five years ago.

46
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.190
But five years ago, a laborer named Kwon Hyeok Soo had committed suicide.

47
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.000
That elder's son?

48
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.880
I saw my father through that person's death.

49
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.020
What started as conviction turned into naivety.

50
00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:09.500
From the disdain and scorn of his colleagues until the result of death.

51
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.440
It was just the same.

52
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.730
I started to look for the truth after that,

53
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.800
and behind both deaths

54
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.820
was Chairman Jang, I learned.

55
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.460
Those days I had lived as a loyal and groveling dog; I couldn't bear them anymore.

56
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.750
That's why I didn't reject going to jail for four years.

57
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.460
You must've hurt a lot, Seonbae, alone for that long time.

58
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.700
While I was in jail, I thought of my father a lot.

59
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.110
The hatred and fury I had held on to from my father's death

60
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.080
was actually a yearning and apologetic heart towards my father.

61
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:55.420
As time passed, I became even sorrier and longed for him more.

62
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.600
Dad.

63
00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.810
Dad! Dad!

64
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.720
Dad!

65
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.530
What is this that's inside, that you can't bring yourself to drink.

66
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.430
It only tastes good.

67
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.520
Seonbae.

68
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.250
Seonbae's father also probably misses you.

69
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:06.260
Because you take after your father you're very warm and kind.

70
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.390
His son for whom it may have been a losing fight always took the side of the loser.

71
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.530
I feel he'd be very curious

72
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:25.020
about how you'll live from now on and what you'll live for.

73
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:48.000
It's convoluted and many things are between us.

74
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.930
<i>Fall 1995</i>

75
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.770
Excuse me, I'm sorry but do you know if this family has maybe moved?

76
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.620
I don't think I've seen them coming out recently

77
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.360
Whether they moved or not I'm not sure.

What about Ji soo. Did you try looking for her a bit?

Thanks to you, I've become really close with the music school kids.

What're you going to do with the money you've earned?

143
00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.910
I have to pay back what I'm indebted for.

144
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.160
You even have debt? To whom?

145
00:15:32.830 --> 00:15:35.530
- My father. 
 - Father?

146
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.440
So... your father had lent you tuition?

147
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:45.550
Wow. Your dad's totally doing it American style.

148
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:54.090
What my father had received as wages, he gave it all to me.

149
00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:56.940
So you just kept it?

150
00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.090
I couldn't use it.

151
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:06.660

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.290
What do you mean you don't know?

156
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.370
I don't remember well.

157
00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:56.120
When I went home, off-duty, the last I saw him was in front of our home.

158
00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.760
Maybe it's because it was dark outside

159
00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.950
I can't remember.

160
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:06.280
What's with this?

161
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.630
Who lived life as hardworking as you?

162
00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:40.670
♫ <i>Perhaps, someday we will remember</i> ♫

163
00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:54.590
♫ <i>The promises we kept hidden within our memories</i> ♫

164
00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:02.480
♫ <i>Steeped in love, everything has passed by</i> ♫

165
00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:09.590
♫ <i>Without much to see, faded away into unmemorable years</i> ♫

166
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:15.790
♫ <i>But appearing suddenly, the longing that is you</i> ♫

167
00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:23.140
♫ <i> If we can return to that time, then I would tell you</i> ♫

168
00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.560
To Ji Soo who is somewhere,

169
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:34.030
I am going to become a different person.

170
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.740
So when we do meet sometime in the future,

171
00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.430
even if I have changed a lot please do recognize me.

172
00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:52.920
♫ <i>You are no longer a memory, but my every day</i> ♫

173
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:11.220
Would that be enough? He's going to be completely unrestrained in his attack.

174
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.010
According to what the legal team has reviewed, there isn't anything that would pose a problem for us.

175
00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.190
Rather, VP Han's side would be even more strained by the prosecution.

176
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:23.970
Did he not know that?

177
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.790
What's his motive.

178
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.950
Since there hasn't been anything that's come up from the dust, we're still looking into it.

179
00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.110
- But... 
 - But what?

180
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:37.160
The ledger books that we had prepared in advance of the search warrant

181
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.480
were easily accepted by the prosecution.

182
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.890
The fact that they took a ten-year log of the electronic payments and notes from the shareholder meetings

183
00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:47.660
bothers me. It's the same for the subsidiaries.

184
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.920
Then you should've touched things up way in advance.

185
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.300
To have all the subsidiary paperwork to be uniform is just way too much.

186
00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.580
Why is it that you have so many excuses nowadays?

187
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.990
Though they say there's no grave without any circumstance (every situation has its just reasons), you're always like this.

188
00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:14.410
<i>Vice President, the President is asking you to come up.</i>

189
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.080
I heard you had a lot of work yesterday. You came to work early today.

190
00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.170
Yes, you came early too, Chairman.

191
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.910
Well, I'm someone who always wishes for the sun to rise faster every single morning.

192
00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.100
The fun of working is the fun of living.

193
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.140
Why? Do you want me to hurry and say what I want to say?

194
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:47.380
Of course, our relationship isn't one where we say good morning and make small talk.

195
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:54.160
How far are you trying to take this?

196
00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:00.320
Or do you suppose that there's no point asking a question we both know the answer to?

197
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.300
Do you want to be the chairman of Hyeong Seong Group?

198
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:16.070
I guess since you've been going in and out of the prosecutor's office your exercising your right to remain silent has become ingrained.

199
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.580
Okay then, let's talk about the most recent things.

200
00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:22.290
The prosecutor that has become quite close to you recently,

201
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.700
having him go through Seo Gyeong and me with a search warrant

202
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.890
That's because of the Hyeong Seong Group's slush funds and dividends, right?

203
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:34.900
It's not Hyeong Seong Group's but your slush funds and dividends, Chairman.

204
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:40.270
That is your bare face. I love these kinds of conversations.

205
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.920
Your words have a newly soiled rotting stench to them.

206
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:51.210
You know about the special exception for relatives?

207
00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:55.690
Those dividends from your borrowed name accounts and slush funds,

208
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.230
even if they went to not you, but me or Seo Kyeong,

209
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:03.460
it states that no responsibility will be accounted for in the court of law.

210
00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.380
That stealing amongst relatives is not stealing. You know it's something like that.

211
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.300
Those for whom the special exception for relatives applies are blood relations,

212
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.190
and blood relations are as is in the word, those who share blood.

213
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.800
Unfortunately, you are not my blood relative.

214
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:26.340
Just like you've always emphasized, our blood-ties are different.

215
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.820
It seems like you're trying to take me down without affecting Seo Kyung.

216
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.590
But there isn't any money that I received with my own name. It was all received under Seo Kyeong's name.

217
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:45.740
No matter how you tell the police that the money is mine, I'm going to say that it belongs to Seo Kyeong.

218
00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:51.230
You know how much I don't want to go to prison.

219
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.280
Even if I have to give up my own daughter, I won't go.

220
00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.810
Yes.

221
00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.120
I know there's no way you would go, Chairman.

222
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.670
It's the same for you too.

223
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.860
Your wife is the mother of your child.

224
00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:09.650
Would it do for you to make her eat rice and beans (a euphemism for prison)?

225
00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:13.170
On top of that, the money that Seo Kyeong has

226
00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:17.960
is also your kid, Joon Seo's money.

227
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.440
I'll handle this accordingly.

228
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.180
Since we're on the topic of Joon Seo,

229
00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:30.510
they say Yoon Ji Soo's son committed violence against Joon Seo.

230
00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:34.830
What should we do about this? It even got to my ear.

231
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.130
What do you want to say?

232
00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.070
You already know the answer.

233
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.090
Don't ask useless questions.

234
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:54.940
Jae Hyeon, give me some time today.

235
00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.980
I have also have that darned "something I must say."

236
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.540
Let's meet there tonight.

237
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.000
The place where we started.

238
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.270
So, who is it that you lost!

239
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:17.150
<i>I told you everything, why won't you tell me? It's unfair.</i>

240
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.830
<i>I know exactly what you lost.</i>

241
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:24.260
- Do you remember? 
 - Your sanity.

242
00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.580
<i>Is that funny?</i>

243
00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:30.810
<i>I really like you.</i>

244
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.120
<i>Let's date.</i>

245
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.390
<i>Oh my.</i>

246
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.960
<i>I can't ride this.</i>

247
00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.430
<i>I can ride the scariest rollercoaster here with both eyes open and both hands in the air.</i>

248
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:52.830
<i>But, I can't ride this one.</i>

249
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:54.950
<i>Why?</i>

250
00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.280
<i>My mom left me here.</i>

251
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:09.040
<i>I was just a seven-year-old girl.</i>

252
00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:14.490
<i>My spitefulness resembles my mother.</i>

253
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.370
<i>You have to face it to break it.</i>

254
00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.130
<i>What?</i>

255
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.410
<i>Your trauma.</i>

256
00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.530
<i>Do you really think I don't ride this because I'm truly scared?</i>

257
00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.770
I'm not riding it because it's childish. I'm not a kid.

258
00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.410
The person who you saw when you were sitting there

259
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.400
I'm saying that I won't let that person be your mom, Seo Gyeong.

260
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:43.130
If you were going to be like this, why didn't you just disappear back then?

261
00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:50.110
What's up with this. Am I getting thrown away again?

262
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:59.480
Let's go back to that time.

263
00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.100
I will throw away Se Hwi. I won't run a temper and I'll only look at you.

264
00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.510
It's not that I can't do that.

265
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.310
I just didn't.

266
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:12.250
It was a bit boring and

267
00:27:12.250 --> 00:27:15.970
I felt I needed to give you some kind of irritation,

268
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.470
so I looked around for something fun and new.

269
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.700
Now I don't like that either. It's not fun.

270
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:28.180
I'm sorry, Seo Kyeong.

271
00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:33.480
It's like we're trying to glue together a broken window.

272
00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.260
I'm sorry too,

273
00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.050
but I won't end this.

274
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.310
A broken window? Why can't we glue it back together?

275
00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:49.970
Since I broke it, I'll put it back together.

276
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:54.910
I can put it back together without any flaws.

277
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.210
What are you doing, Teacher Yoon?

278
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.290
Director.

279
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:40.090
I'll find a way,

280
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:42.480
so will you wait a bit?

281
00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:49.510
I thought it would be a shame to lose you, Byeol, so I was a bit thoughtless.

282
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:52.240
What's being thoughtless?

283
00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:00.700
It means that your heart got ahead of yourself, so you fell as you dashed forward?

284
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.950
Are you supposed to follow your heart slowly?

285
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.470
Yeah. The heart should go slowly,

286
00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.580
but once the heart starts leaping forward, it's hard to stop.

287
00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.520
I think I'm doing that too.

288
00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:27.630
Being thoughtless.

289
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:34.560
I bragged to Yoo Bin about you teaching me how to play the piano.

290
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.100
That's also not your fault, but mine.

291
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.500
You wanting to brag about it is something that's natural. Trying to teach you secretly was what was wrong.

292
00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:47.290
Then what do we do?

293
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:51.340
I have to hurry up and open a piano academy.

294
00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.460
<i>Rental Inquiry</i>

295
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.680
Don't catch anyone else's eye and stay well hidden

296
00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.950
because I'm going to be back with money.

297
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.310
Hello Yoo Bin's mother

298
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:26.620
Hello, teach--

299
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:37.450
Yoo Bin's mother had found out that Teacher Yoon didn't graduate college.

300
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:41.490
You know that Yoo Bin and Byeol are in the same class right?

301
00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:46.970
Giving free lessons to Byeol ultimately set you back.

302
00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.510
<i>Ocean Music School</i>

303
00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:55.000
<i>Seonbae Jae Hyeon</i>

304
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.280
So, do you not have any work?

305
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.760
No, I have a lot of private lessons.

306
00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:17.310
Would that do it?

307
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.730
Do what?

308
00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:22.340
Make you able to eat?

309
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.660
I have to make it so.

310
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.240
It does. I don't have any need to spend money.

311
00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.760
So even if I quit this academy, there's no problem.

312
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.500
This isn't a company card, but my personal one.

313
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:44.610
The company can't track it and there's no limit.

314
00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.790
Am I being tested?

315
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:50.140
Like how... "still will you refuse?"

316
00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.550
It's because I want to do something for you.

317
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:57.940
I couldn't think of anything to amend the missing 25 years other than money. So I felt tormented, too.

318
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.510
I didn't know I was so lacking in imagination.

319
00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:06.180
Then increase your imagination. Whether you get lessons on it or go to an academy.

320
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:14.570
Still the same, I see.

321
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:19.850
Is it Hye Jeong?

322
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.590
I didn't order.

323
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.520
You're not Yoon Ji Soo?

324
00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.580
I am.

325
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.850
Whoa. What is all this?

326
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.030
Did they say there's going to be a war tomorrow?

327
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.560
Is it a home or a supermarket?

328
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.790
Would you like to take some?

329
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:47.450
What is up with this really? There's really no reason for you to buy things up like this.

330
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:50.480
You're such a miser buying up only bagged rice. 
 (bagged rice is quartered leftover rice in muslin bags from the standard 20 kg rice size.)

331
00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.620
Did you perhaps get registered somewhere as a "less fortunate neighbor"?

332
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:57.260
Is this all from the civic group, "Warm hands from a warm heart"?

333
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.490
It's Seonbae Jae Hyeon.

334
00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.340
You, really insist on truly...

335
00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.820
Come and sit for a bit. I'll fix up something yummy.

336
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:09.390
It's fine. How can I eat here being all conflicted?

337
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.720
Let's eat out.

338
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.460
Shall we?

339
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.320
I thought you had quit drinking because you had long stopped coming here.

340
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.680
I couldn't come because living was so laborious.

341
00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.210
I won't take your money, so just come.

342
00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.230
Do you make alcohol from tap water or something?

343
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.490
You buy alcohol and other ingredients. That's all probably off credit.

344
00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.110
How can I bear to drink for free?

345
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.980
Anyway, I'm so scared of credit card debt.

346
00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.620
I wish the 25th didn't exist 
 (Most credit card company payment deadlines in Korea are on  the 25th though you can set it)

347
00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.040
Wish it were just like this. Twenty-three, 24, 26.

348
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.950
Then that means that you wouldn't even be able to get your wages.

349
00:33:35.950 --> 00:33:39.000
Then I guess I should change the date of payment!

350
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.850
So, why aren't you drinking?

351
00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.720
Just because.

352
00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:57.610
What are we going to do about this awkward mood. Did you two fight?

353
00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:01.300
What do you mean fight? Do you fight with your finger?

354
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.660
A finger?

355
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.150
A pained finger (a sore spot)?

356
00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.230
Still, you should be careful. It could turn out to be the middle finger.

357
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.800
Then...

358
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.560
Don't do things like that.

359
00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:23.990
Take your hands off because you're so bloody adorable!

360
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.900
That's why that man can't bear to let you go.

373
00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:08.170
Why yes. Hello.

374
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:13.060
<i>If you perhaps have some time, I wondered if you could stop by.</i>

375
00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.670
What is the matter?

<i>The Prosecutor General is looking for you.</i>

377

Did something happen again?

378
00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:26.740
<i>Oh, no. He's actually leaning towards being okay since he's sound of mind.</i>

379
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.280
I understand.

380
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.390
Father.

381
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:50.830
I heard you were looking for me.

382
00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:56.060
Would you like to go catch a breeze?

383
00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:18.250
Do not forgive me.

384
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:29.300
Even if you were to push me off here right now, that would be okay too.

385
00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.340
What do you mean?

386
00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.020
Ji Soo has no fault,

387
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.880
so all the fault lies with me.

388
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:56.750
My hurting finger

389
00:37:56.750 --> 00:38:00.430
should not hurt any longer.

390
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:15.220
The person who indicted your father for illegal labor union formation,

391
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.230
was me.

392
00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.650
<i>1995 May</i>

393
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:33.500
That summer, that year. The year that my life stopped. That summer

394
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.370
while you had escaped with Ji Soo,

395
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:42.350
your father had reported Hyeong Seong management for disruption of labor union formation

396
00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:45.830
to the Central Prosecutor's Office.

397
00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:51.060
As soon as I heard the report, I knew it was your father.

398
00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:57.170
At that time, I was feeling extreme rage towards you and Ji Soo.

399
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:01.370
At that time, your father had appeared before me

400
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.260
and Chairman Jang San.

401
00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:12.040
Chairman Jang had requested I silence the report against Hyeong Seong

402
00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:15.030
but I didn't.

403
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:19.220
Rather I had indicted your father.

404
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:27.730
All the crimes and wrongdoings of Hyeong Seong your father had reported

405
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:32.790
I had flipped to be applied to your father.

406
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.430
Your father despaired.

407
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.190
Chairman Jang was glad.

408
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.160
I was satisfied.

409
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:48.340
Chairman Jang had promised to avidly support me in my bid for the political theatre,

410
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.060
and as my fury towards you and Ji Soo deepened,

411
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.300
it felt the compensation had increased.

412
00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:01.450
I had spoken of indignation, yet my face was all smiles.

413
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:06.700
And the end in that summer had come.

414
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:16.730
I have lost a home to go back to, my family,

415
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:21.140
my job, and my career.

416
00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.130
I didn't know the meaning of

417
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:31.500
of the scale that Lady Justice holds in front of the court,

418
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:38.070
and I had forgotten the warning that the sword in her other hand represents.

419
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:45.790
In an instant that summer of that year,

420
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.110
everything was taken from me.

421
00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.820
From that time until now

422
00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.880
my watch has stopped.

423
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:11.210
Now, my physical clock is about to stop.

424
00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.490
I am very sorry.

425
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:34.130
The sins that I have committed towards you are too great and deep.

426
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:42.860
I pray that you will accept my apology.

427
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:13.750
Did something happen at the care center? Your countenance looks too dark.

428
00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:38.930
Joon Seo,

429
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.570
do you want to go on a trip with me?

430
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.320
We could go camping, night fishing,

431
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:53.950
or even hiking.

432
00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:01.440
If we go to Gangneung, there is the sea and a lot of fun activities to do.

433
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:10.360
Since there are more fun and exciting things to do outside of the world at the palm of your hands,

434
00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.030
give it some thought.

435
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.850
<i>Father</i>

436
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:36.800
You're late. A lot of bros wanted you to go drink because it's your first day on the job, right?

437
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.320
Why are you outside?

438
00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.920
And why are you starting to smoke again?

439
00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:47.230
I just can't sleep.

440
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.740
Let's go in.

441
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:03.460
He wanted you to eat something good before going back on duty.

442
00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.470
I think that's why he's still working.

443
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.610
What does Father do for work?

444
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:21.320
He doesn't say, but

445
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:27.950
he always comes home with black hands so I don't think the work is something where you sit still.

446
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:37.110
It seems like he's giving me everything he gets paid.

447
00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.980
<i>₩30,000 (appx $30)</i>

448
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:45.590
How are you these days?

449
00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.620
It just is.

450
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.590
I've acted a couple of times, but a lead role hasn't come yet.

451
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.720
Why do you meet me?

452
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.410
Naturally,

453
00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:01.260
because I like you.

454
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:05.950
You like me or my money?

455
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:09.570
Why are you like this today?

456
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.400
Did something happen at home?

457
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.170
You don't want me to get a divorce, right?

458
00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:24.890
That way, you can hang around with me for a little bit and then go and play somewhere else.

459
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:31.070
That's right. I don't want you to get a divorce.

460
00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.710
It's because you will have a really hard time.

461
00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:45.150
You still really love him. Your husband.

462
00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.310
I'm sorry. I've been practicing things like this these days.

463
00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.690
Mom is going to go to do piano lessons. So when Grandpa wakes up,

464
00:47:06.690 --> 00:47:09.920
eat the lunchbox and fruit over there, okay?

465
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:14.810
What if Grandpa gets upset? He doesn't even recognize me.

466
00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:16.440
Then it'll probably be better.

467
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.810
He usually doesn't get upset with people he doesn't know.

468
00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.530
Alright.

469
00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.850
Hello.

470
00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:57.780
You need to gain some weight. You're so stick-skinny maybe because you take after your mom.

471
00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.410
What grade are you in right now?

472
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:05.080
I'm a second year in middle school.

473
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.190
Do middle schoolers not like this kind of stuff?

474
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.080
I got this thinking you were in elementary school.

475
00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.900
I don't really have anything else to give you.

476
00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.380
It's okay. I like it.

477
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.790
Oh really?

478
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:25.770
Then, take this.

479
00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:28.590
Here. This too.

480
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:34.260
This one too. And this too.

481
00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.730
But, this isn't free okay?

482
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.420
Pardon?

483
00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:49.580
I'm giving these to you so that you unconditionally listen to your mom well and take her side.

484
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.120
Yes.

485
00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:57.790
Your mom went through a lot, so

486
00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:02.140
in order for your mom to be happy,

487
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:07.630
you need to support her and take her side.

488
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:13.790
You need to happily live with her

489
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:18.190
like that for a very long time. Okay?

490
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.750
Are you confident you won't regret it? Quitting school.

491
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:49.050
Yes.

492
00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.980
You aren't going to tell me why you got into a fight?

493
00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.130
I'm sorry.

494
00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:03.850
But Yeong Min, in terms of custody, you're in the worst position possible.

495
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:09.070
If they say that if I sue to will bring you back, there is a 99% chance that your Dad is going to win.

496
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:13.260
That's why it will be better if you tell me.

497
00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:17.060
Why you fought and why you decided to leave the school.

498
00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.630
If any of your reasons are due to finances, I have no choice but to bring you back.

499
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.570
It's nothing like that.

500
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:26.540
Then? What is the reason?

501
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:40.170
But, I think living with you would be good too, Dad.

502
00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:50.320
<i>[Aunt]</i>

503
00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:51.230
<i>Yes Aunt.</i>

504
00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.770
<i>Your father had difficulty breathing all of a sudden</i>

505
00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:59.200
<i>so he was sent to the emergency room.</i>

506
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:12.020
His pneumonia has worsened, so it's difficult for him to breathe unassisted.

507
00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:23.630
<i>Intensive Care Unit
 Central Supply Room
 ICU Access Restricted</i>

508
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:38.400
Ji Soo. Hye Jeong called me and told me to go ahead first.

509
00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:43.770
But, what happened?

510
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.880
He got pneumonia and it's worsened.

511
00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:05.230
You were surprised that I suddenly called you, right?

512
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:07.270
Yes. A little bit.

513
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.210
I don't know how long your Mom is going to be in the hospital, so

514
00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:12.650
you should sleep at my place for now

515
00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:15.160
come to the hospital tomorrow when the sun is up.

516
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.050
Yes.

517
00:52:17.050 --> 00:52:22.040
Ah. Also, my husband can seem a little like a wild caveman, but

518
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.890
he isn't a bad man so just eat with him, okay?

519
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:31.140
After that, you can watch TV and if you really feel like it, you can study too.

520
00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.370
But, is Grandpa okay?

521
00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:39.780
Hey. Your Grandpa is strong.

522
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.040
You probably don't know this, but a long time ago, your Grandpa

523
00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:48.430
used to be in the top 3 strongest people in Korea.

524
00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:50.530
He's really skinny though.

525
00:52:50.530 --> 00:52:55.990
I didn't mean like a wrestler, but strength when it comes to catching and throwing in the bad guys.

526
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.820

<i>Seonbae Dong Jin</i>

528
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:09.500
What is it?

529
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.900
<i>Would you like to go to Yeong Woo's bar tonight?</i>

530
00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.210
<i>I unexpectedly got some money.</i>

531
00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:20.790
Aigoo Mr. Dad, this isn't the time to be talking about unexpected money or whatnot.

532
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:31.020
Yeah, Dong Jin.

533
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:32.910
You're not going to the hospital?

534
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:33.730
Hospital?

535
00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:36.380
I knew this would happen. Ji Soo wouldn't have said anything.

536
00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.090
What do you mean?

537
00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:42.460
Ji Soo's father is in the ICU.

538
00:53:51.930 --> 00:53:53.950
Guardian of Patient Yoon Hyeong Gu?

539
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.540
Are there any other family members?

540
00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.510
There isn't anyone else left to come. He does have a young grandson.

541
00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:06.010
I think it would be best for you to share your last farewells.

542
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:38.650
Shouldn't you <i>not</i> take off the respirator?

543
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:43.100
He signed off on an order that he wouldn't undergo life support.

544
00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:49.300
I am sorry, Ji Soo.

545
00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.600
If you're truly sorry, you need to get up, Dad.

546
00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:01.340
I couldn't even hug you once properly.

547
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:08.050
No, I'm okay.

548
00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:14.790
During this time, all the bad deeds I've done

549
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:23.410
all the heavy burdens, I will take them all with me

550
00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:30.520
so that only the good is left with you.

551
00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:40.810
So you must be happy, Ji Soo.

552
00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:51.800
Dad. I am so sorry.

553
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:02.600
Dad. Dad. Tell Ji Yeong and Mom

554
00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.220
that I am sorry, be sure to tell them.

555
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.900
Dad!

556
00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:15.950
Dad!

557
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:19.420
Dad!

558
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:43.010
Now,

559
00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:51.680
I hope no one leaves.

<i>When My Love Blooms: The Moment When Living Becomes a Flower</i>

<i>I couldn't bring myself to say these things</i>

564
