(Previously on Episode 14)
I like you.

16
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:41,940
I like you, too!

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,220
How could you cheat on her?

18
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,380
Please don't speak ill of my boyfriend
behind his back.

19
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,940
Nice to meet you. I'm Ren Yiyang.

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,700
Nice to meet you. I'm your Chinese tutor.

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,300
My name is Zhou Xiao.

22
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,660
You buy me dinner?

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,660
Sure.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,220
Zhou Xiao.

25
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:04,980
(Episode 15: Have No Fear,
Your Elder Sister Is Here)

26
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,260
Remember to bring a rubber band.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,780
So she can tie her hair

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,580
with the rubber band during meals.

29
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,460
Put an umbrella in your backpack.

30
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,460
It'd better be the type of umbrella
with sun and rain protection.

31
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,220
If her phone model is different from yours,

32
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,780
bring a charger cable
designed for her phone model.

33
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,300
Bring some pocket money.

34
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,820
I barely got into the dorm

35
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,140
before the dorm keeper
locked the dorm door.

36
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
It's a good thing I have long legs.

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,540
Hey.

38
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,980
I waited for Chen Yu for the whole night.

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,780
He never showed up.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,780
But I'm not giving up.

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,140
I'll still be waiting there tomorrow.

42
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,180
My love

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,540
is really touching.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,020
Are you and Chen Yu really not close?

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,300
Think it over.

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,380
What should we do now?

47
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,540
This is not right.

48
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,540
We should be investigating.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,300
Come on. Let's go to Chen Yu's apartment.

50
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,140
Beat him before anything else.

51
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,020
You'll upset Lu.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,940
Take a seat.

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,380
Why would I be upset?

54
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,460
Don't change your shoes.

55
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,540
What's happening?

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,140
Take a seat, Lu.

57
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:28,940
Come here.

58
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:30,820
Well,

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,300
today,

60
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,500
Xie Yixing came to me

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,340
for Chen Yu.

62
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,500
We think

63
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,900
we should talk to you.

64
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,780
I have asked him.

65
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,700
He said these things belonged to his cousin.

66
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,460
Not buying it.

67
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,900
Haven't you heard of this saying?

68
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,060
Boys with rubber bands

69
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,100
are no easy preys.

70
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,700
I've never heard of this saying.

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,740
Then you have heard of it now.

72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,740
I don't want to hear from you right now.

73
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,660
I don't care. You have heard of it.

74
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,820
Aw.

75
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,340
Stop fighting.

76
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,220
Someone is going to take advantage of Lu.

77
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,980
It's okay, Wei.

78
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,020
Who am I?

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,260
I get to pick on people.

80
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,620
People can never get to pick on me.

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,780
But we are

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,020
really worried about you.

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,820
Yeah.

84
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Alright.

85
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,980
If I need you guys,

86
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,180
I will ask for your help.

87
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,900
Look at you.

88
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,740
You all look so worried.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,060
I'd like to treat you to late-night snacks.

90
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,020
Interested?

91
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:33,900
Yes.

92
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,420
Come on.

93
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,900
It's weekend.

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,460
Why did you ask me out early in the morning?

95
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,340
See for yourself.

96
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,060
What is this?

97
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,500
(Places to choose for our first date)

98
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Plan A: Go to a theater.

99
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,260
The movies currently playing in the theater
include "This Is Not What I Expected",

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,740
"The Fate of the Furious"

101
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,980
and "Mad World".

102
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,380
To keep Zhou Xiao in a good mood,

103
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,340
it's suggested to choose
between the first movie and the second movie.

104
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,700
Plan B: Go to a hot pot restaurant.

105
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,060
It is a noisy place.

106
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:28,860
But Zhou Xiao put emphasis on it

107
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,100
when talking to me yesterday.

108
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,300
So it has been made into an alternative plan.

109
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,100
Will you go on a date with me?

110
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,460
As I said, I won't disappoint you.

111
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,580
Where are we going?

112
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,620
We will go

170
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,820
You are welcome.

171
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,780
Boys with rubber bands

172
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,100
are no easy preys.

173
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,580
He acted so adeptly

174
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,140
when he tied my hair.

175
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,700
Lu.

176
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,460
Are you going on a date with Chen Yu?

177
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,300
No.

178
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,820
Then why are you wearing a face mask?

179
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,580
Can't I look good for myself?

180
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,100
You can.

181
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,100
Speak of the devil.

182
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,020
I have found the evidence you asked for.

183
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,940
I have got the girl's phone number for you.

184
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,660
You can call her to verify my words.

185
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,780
You'll decide whether to break up with him.

186
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,340
It's none of my business.

187
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,500
Lu.

188
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,460
What's wrong?

189
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,660
(I'm resolving this matter.
This is her number. )

190
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,900
Outrageous.

191
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,540
I'm going to ask Fang Wei
for a weapon right now.

192
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,300
What happened?

193
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,700
Look.

194
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,820
I'll go out and make a call.

195
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,620
What are you marking?

196
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,540
Make a guess.

197
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,860
Are you okay?

198
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,020
I'm okay.

199
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,700
Your work looks so ugly.
I can't even guess what it is.

200
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,460
Let me have a look.

201
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,020
No.

202
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,020
Let me have a look.

203
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:15,660
No.

204
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,580
Hello? Lazy Ling.

205
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,980
I'm going on a date with Zhao Fanzhou.

206
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,420
Got no time to bring you a meal.

207
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,460
It's not about that.

208
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,820
Xie Yixing has found evidence
of Chen Yu's infidelity.

209
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,540
Lu said to confront Chen Yu

210
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,460
in the cafe right now.

211
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:38,860
What?

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,580
Lu is going to the cafe to confront Chen Yu?

213
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,780
I'll be back soon.

214
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,100
On second thought,

215
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
we are grownups.

216
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,420
We should give Lu

217
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,540
some private space,

218
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,820
so that she can handle her relationship.

219
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,260
So,

220
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,980
we should let Lu go alone?

221
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
Hold on a second.

222
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,900
I need to answer the phone outside.

223
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,500
Zhou Xiao.

224
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,580
Zhou Xiao, where are you?

225
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,620
How can you do this?

226
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,740
You can't just stand by.

227
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,260
I'm not standing by.

228
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,020
I was putting on an act for Zhao Fanzhou.

229
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,580
Right now,

230
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,900
you need to take everything

231
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,220
that can be used as a weapon
from our dorm room.

232
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,580
This might be a tough fight.

233
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:35,980
Okay.

234
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,380
But

235
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:40,540
Lu said she would handle it herself.

236
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,140
We'll follow her in secret.

237
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,380
If she can handle it, we will disappear.

238
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,580
If she gets picked on,

239
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,340
we will fight for her.

240
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes.

241
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,340
I'll be there soon.

242
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,980
Bring the knife.

243
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,700
The hair curler.

244
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
What else have you got?

245
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,420
Wei.

246
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,060
Bring your pen.

247
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,500
I want the pen with the sharpest nib.

248
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:19,860
Got it.

249
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,860
It's been a long time.

250
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,340
Why is Chen Yu still not here?

251
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,700
I'm getting sick from sitting.

252
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,540
Lower your voice.

253
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,660
Don't let yourself be noticed.

254
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,540
He is so antsy.

255
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,740
Why did you bring him here?

256
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,580
In case there is a fight,

257
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,380
he can protect Lu with his life.

258
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,980
No wonder you are
the president of Detective Club.

259
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,380
You see the truth and you get me.

260
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,380
Chen Yu is here. Chen Yu is here.

261
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,700
But I have something else to do today.

262
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,860
That's all right.

263
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,340
Sorry.

264
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,820
You must have waited for me long.

265
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,540
It's okay.

266
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,140
Lately, I have been busy
showing my father around

267
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,300
instead of spending time with you.

268
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,140
You aren't mad, are you?

269
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,020
Why would I be mad?

270
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,820
Here. Get something to drink.

271
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,540
What's up with Lu?

272
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,900
Is she reluctant to break up?

273
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,580
Wait. Just wait.

274
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,100
I don't see anything I want to drink.

275
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,660
You'd better order a drink.

276
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,740
It'll steady your nerves later.

277
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:49,980
What's going on?

278
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,660
Didn't you say you wouldn't be mad?

279
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,820
You know

280
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,580
I'm not good at comforting my girlfriend.

281
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,420
So

282
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,900
you are saying

283
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,300
I am

284
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,980
your girlfriend.

285
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,540
What are you talking about?

286
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,860
Of course you are my girlfriend.

287
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,740
How come you are here?

288
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,900
Chen Yu.

289
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,460
I never knew you are this kind of person.

290
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm breaking up with you.

291
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,540
Listen to me.

292
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,060
Let me go.

293
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,860
Your touch disgusts me now.

294
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,020
Thank you.

295
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,580
Wow.

296
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,620
Lu was right.

297
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,180
She doesn't need us.

298
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,140
So cool.

299
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,860
That's the girl I like.

300
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,500
Lu.

301
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,860
You think this is funny?

302
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,980
I think it's extremely funny.

303
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,820
You confessed your love for me.

304
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,500
I didn't force you.

305
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,700
So?

306
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,660
Girls who court boys are worthless.

307
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,820
Don't you know that?

308
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,220
I don't know.

309
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,620
And I don't want to know

310
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,180
anything about men like you.

311
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,060
You shouldn't have played with me
if you couldn't pay the price.

312
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,620
Drop your act.

313
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,020
Who says I was playing with you?

314
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,500
What,

315
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,660
you got serious

316
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,180
and I had to do the same?

317
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,180
Do you know what the girls
of the Badminton Club

318
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,300
said about you behind your back?

319
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,980
Do you want me to repeat what they said?

320
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,900
Shut your mouth.

321
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,180
Apologize to Lu.

322
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,900
Apologize to her!

323
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,460
Did I say anything wrong?

324
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:50,980
I said to apologize!

325
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:51,740
Xie Yixing.

326
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,220
Believe it or not, I'm going to destroy you.

327
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,420
Xie Yixing.

328
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,820
Let's leave this place.

329
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,220
Please.

330
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,140
Come on. Hurry up.

331
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,340
What are you doing?

332
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,660
Avenging our friend.

333
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,660
Wei.

334
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,620
This is not okay.

335
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,620
This is not okay.

336
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,420
Get another one.

337
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,020
Hey.

338
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,820
This is for you taking advantage of Lu.

339
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,140
Sorry.

340
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,020
Stay away from Lu.

341
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,100
Stay away!

342
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,020
Run. Run.

343
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,220
I'll buy you a bottle of water.

344
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:21,940
Wait here for me.

345
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,540
This place is very soundproof.

346
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,420
No. I can't keep on running.

347
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,700
Why are we running?

348
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,740
You can't stop running.

349
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,660
What if he retaliates against us?

350
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,220
Just hit me.

351
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,380
I shouldn't have sneaked away.

352
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,860
I put my friends before you.

353
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,860
I was heartless.

354
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,060
(999 Ganmaoling Granules)

355
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,420
Why do you give me this thing?

356
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,580
Because I worry about you.

357
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,380
Why would you worry about me?

358
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,420
Are you okay?

359
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm okay.

360
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,860
You take such good care of people.

361
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,140
Aren't you opening it?

362
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,900
Why should I open it now?

363
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,340
I know it contains granules.

364
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,260
Open it.

365
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,580
A tobacco pipe.

366
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,940
Why is this thing here?

367
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
I made it.

368
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:24,900
You made it?

369
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,580
Why did you make it?

370
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,300
You love being a detective, right?

371
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,340
Right.

372
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,060
Every detective has a tobacco pipe.

373
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,220
Why are you smiling?

374
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,580
Nothing.

375
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,020
I just think your gift is interesting.

376
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,100
I like it.

377
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,020
Great.

378
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,140
But how did it come to your mind?

379
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,740
Professor Hu gave me the idea.

380
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,340
You are a relationship expert.

381
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,220
You don't need anyone to teach you.

382
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,940
What do you mean?

383
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,060
I...

384
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,460
You just feel

385
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,540
like a relationship expert to me.

386
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,580
I won't deny.

387
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,060
I knew it.

388
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,420
You knew what?

389
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,140
I'm not

390
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,780
fussing about anything

391
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,700
or prying

392
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,100
into your privacy.

393
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,380
I'm just curious.

394
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,460
Seriously, how many relationships
did you have?

395
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,700
Like a thousand times?

396
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,860
Only once.

397
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,740
How long did it last?

398
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,020
One week.

399
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,740
You broke up so fast.

400
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,380
I haven't broken up with her yet.

401
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,220
Then I'm the other woman.

402
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,140
The only relationship
I have ever had is with you.

403
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,580
So you are new at this.

404
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,180
You've been acting like
you are a relationship expert.

405
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,700
If you can't say the right thing,
don't say anything.

406
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,700
Wait,

407
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,660
how did you get
so good at tying people's hair?

408
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,700
It's not that hard.

409
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,380
It's not hard?

410
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,780
When I was a kid, I spent a long time
learning how to tie my hair.

411
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,220
I said it wasn't hard, and it isn't hard.

412
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,900
Oh. Okay.

413
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,460
I've got a piece of advice for you.

414
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,620
Since you are new at this,

415
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,100
don't ever claim

416
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,460
that you are

417
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,860
a relationship expert again.

418
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,820
It's not good.

419
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,580
Water. Water. Water.

420
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,900
Ms. Liu.

421
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,700
I'm here for the latest book list

422
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,300
that requires an update of bar codes.

423
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,380
Hang on. I'll look for it.

424
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,700
Okay.

425
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,340
Ms. Huang.

426
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,260
Professor Hu of
the Department of Forensic Medicine

427
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,620
needs to borrow a precious literature

428
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,180
and I'm here to ask you for the key.

429
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,700
Fill in the register form.

430
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,460
Okay.

431
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,540
I've finished filling in the form.

432
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,900
Here is the key.

433
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,700
Thank you, Ms. Huang.

434
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,460
I have finally found it.

435
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,740
Zhao Fanzhou.

436
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:56,900
What else do you need?

437
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,700
I'm waiting for Zhou Xiao.

438
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,700
Zhou Xiao.

439
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,780
Ms. Liu, I'll get going.

440
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,060
Zhou Xiao is...

441
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,620
She is my girlfriend.

442
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,220
Ms. Liu, I have to go now.

443
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,580
Why is he...

444
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,140
Why is he

445
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,020
telling us about that?

446
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,100
Stop telling people I'm your girlfriend.

447
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,700
Why?

448
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,300
Do your best to keep a low profile.

449
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,140
I don't want to keep a low profile.

450
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:39,620
Why?

451
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,100
Because I want

452
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,140
status.

453
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,460
You sound like a dissatisfied housewife.

454
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,900
What are you doing now?

455
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,580
You need to fetch meals for Lu these days.

456
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,380
Let me update the bar codes for you.

457
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,460
You'll do that?

458
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,460
You are the best.

459
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,820
And what do you say about my status?

460
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:09,940
You are my boyfriend.

461
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,020
I'm going to the cafeteria.

462
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,500
What's wrong?

463
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,260
I seem to have forgotten
to bring my cafeteria card.

464
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,540
Use mine.

465
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,380
I'll give it back to you tomorrow.

466
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,060
No need to give it back.

467
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:34,740
Let it stay at your place.

468
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,420
I don't want it.

469
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:05,820
Zhou Xiao.

470
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,660
Lu has stopped

471
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,820
coming here to eat.

472
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,500
I have waited for her

473
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,060
in the cafeteria for days.

474
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,300
She hasn't been having much
of an appetite recently.

475
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,100
Still because of Chen Yu?

476
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,180
Yeah.

477
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,900
I'll have a serving of Wet Fried Beef Rice.

478
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,220
I have no appetite.

479
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,660
Eat as much as you can.

480
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,580
Eat food today

481
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,980
or take medicine tomorrow.

482
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,180
Lu,

483
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,460
I hope you can be thankful

484
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,060
that you never gain weight from eating.

485
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,460
You...

486
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,620
You should be retaliating against
the delicious foods all over the world.

487
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,500
Are you performing a group crosstalk?

488
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,580
I really have no appetite.

489
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:24,900
Lu.

490
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,460
We will eat with you.

491
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,140
You should get your appetite back now.

492
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,300
Come on.

493
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,380
Take these.

494
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,140
For you,

495
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,780
I'm willing to gain weight.

496
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,580
Start eating.

497
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,340
Let's dine together.

498
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,940
You won.

499
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:51,060
I will eat.

500
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,300
Hello?

501
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:05,940
Lu.

502
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,340
I have bought tickets to an amusement park.

503
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,500
Let's have fun there.

504
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,540
I'm not going to an amusement park.
You can go alone.

505
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,700
Wish you a good time.

506
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,460
I've taken pains...

507
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,940
Lu,

508
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,100
did someone just ask you out?

509
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,380
Xie Yixing proposed a trip
to the amusement park.

510
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
I turned him down.

511
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,900
Since you aren't in a good mood,

512
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,980
you should relax a bit outside.

513
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,700
I'm not going.

514
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:35,820
Hey,

515
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,020
where is the bravery you showed that day?

516
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,140
How come the breakup

517
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,700
has driven you out of character?

518
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,860
I've stayed strong for too long.

519
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,180
It has exhausted me.

520
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,740
Have some food.

521
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,860
I'm helping Professor Hu with his experiment.

522
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,980
Will you come to me

523
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,460
after delivering food?

524
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,020
I will.

525
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,500
Come in.

526
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,380
Why aren't you coming in?

527
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,500
Are you the only person here?

528
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,980
What do you expect?

529
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,500
I was afraid that Professor Hu
would be here too

530
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,620
and he would drive me out.

531
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,740
Don't be afraid.

532
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,060
You are my girlfriend now.

533
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,340
What weird experiment
are you doing this time?

534
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,260
Identifying the hair's blood type.

535
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,100
Hair has a blood type?

536
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,020
A human's hair

537
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,100
contains the same blood type

538
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,580
as that of the human.

539
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,860
We can identify the hair's blood type

540
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,140
with the thermal dissociation method.

541
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,500
Show me then.

542
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:37,940
Okay.

543
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,260
Slow down.

544
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,780
Is that it?

545
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,260
I see it.

546
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,300
Got to jot it down.

547
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,860
It's a sudden kiss from my muse.

548
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,980
Muse

549
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
is the goddess of art.

550
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,900
I'm saying

551
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,300
you have inspired me.

552
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,340
Take a seat.

553
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,700
You don't even know that.

554
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,740
I'm a literary giant,

555
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,740
but my boyfriend has
no appreciation for literature.

556
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,140
Do you know why?

557
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,660
Why?

558
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,540
Because I only heard the word

559
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:21,940
"kiss".

560
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,340
I'm warning you. Don't come near.

561
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,020
What are you doing now?

562
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,100
It hurts.

563
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
You tease me.

564
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,100
(Name:
The Bloodthirsty Two-faced Medical Examiner.)

565
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:29,620
Hello?

566
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,180
Zhou,

567
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,420
Zhou Xiao must be with you right now.

568
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,780
I called her and she didn't answer.

569
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,300
What do you need?

570
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,940
I need to ask her for a favor.

571
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
She is sleeping.

572
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,500
What?

573
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,380
It's not what you think.

574
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,340
Then what is going on?

575
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,420
I'm with her.

576
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:48,900
Who is that?

577
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,260
You are awake.

578
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,540
Xie Yixing wants to reach you.

579
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,500
What does he want from me?

580
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,380
Hello?

581
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,620
Hello.

582
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,220
Zhou Xiao, you two are moving
really fast in your relationship.

583
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,260
Huh?

584
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,100
Nothing.

585
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,100
I'm getting serious.

586
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,420
I need to ask you for a favor.

587
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,900
I want you

588
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,620
to persuade Lu

589
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,860
to go to the amusement park with me.

590
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,540
You might not believe me,
but I will tell you the truth.

591
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,900
Everyone in my dorm room

592
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,820
has tried to persuade her to go with you.

593
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,260
Really?

594
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:23,900
Then you should know

595
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,420
Lu is treating me awfully.

596
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,580
You know, I didn't get to finish my sentence

597
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,140
because Lu didn't let me.

598
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,820
She keeps turning me down.

599
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,700
She turned me down
before I could even start talking.

600
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,260
She has gone too far, you know?

601
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,460
I think I have

602
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,380
wasted my breath, you know?

603
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,780
How many nights

604
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,820
have I spent down Chen Yu's house?

605
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,180
How many mosquito bites have I got?

606
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,180
Poor me.

607
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,860
I tried to talk her around.

608
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:46,860
What?

609
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,660
You have got a sleep mark.

610
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,500
Let me rub it.

611
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,140
It's okay.

612
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,780
But I know

613
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,660
it's possible

614
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:53,860
for girls of her age

615
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,340
to do such a thing.

616
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Yeah. Go on.

617
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,180
But she can't let love

618
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,900
make her head spin, you know?

619
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,540
I'm a poor wretch.

620
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,900
Right? You agree that I'm a poor wretch.

621
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,340
About Chen Yu...

622
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,060
Never mind.

623
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,860
Just remember

624
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,700
not to mention Chen Yu.

625
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,300
Well,

626
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,140
I'll make another attempt to help you.

627
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,580
Yeah.

628
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,220
Got to hang up.

629
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,660
Okay. Bye.

630
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,020
Why did you pinch my face?

631
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,100
Because you were talking to him for too long.

632
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,900
Didn't you give me the phone?

633
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,060
You...

634
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:32,940
No.

635
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,900
I must pinch your face in return.

636
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,180
Let me...

637
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:40,740
Just kidding.

638
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,620
Pinch it.

639
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,260
You'd better come over.

640
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:57,460
Not a chance.

641
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,420
You're back.

642
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:08,540
Where is Lu?

643
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,740
Cooperate with me.
We'll go to the amusement park with her.

644
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,180
Don't worry.

645
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,820
Lu.

646
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:35,460
♪Happy break up. May you be happy.♪

647
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,980
♪You can find a better one.♪

648
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,820
Have you got off the bed for once today?

649
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,380
I have.

650
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,780
I ate Wet Fried Beef Rice.

651
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,820
How fun the amusement park would be!

652
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,780
Even I want to go.

653
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,380
Just go out with Xie Yixing.

654
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,340
I don't want to see any male.

655
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,300
Fine.

656
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,900
Only the members of our dorm room will go.

657
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,900
I'm not going.

658
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,460
Just take a walk to relax your mind.

659
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:05,660
You can't just rot away

660
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,900
in the dorm room.

661
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,860
I would rather rot away.

662
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,860
Tao Ling, did you hear that?

663
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,180
Lu said she would rather
rot away in the dorm room

664
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,420
than go to the amusement park with us.

665
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,620
Is that so?

666
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:22,140
You want to rot away?

667
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,660
But

668
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,180
that's bad.

669
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,980
I'm going. I'm going. I'm going.

670
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:32,980
Wonderful.

671
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
Then we are going.

672
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:34,660
We'll go together.

673
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,740
Tao Ling.

674
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,340
I've promised Fang Wei

675
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,660
that I would go to the library with him.

676
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,100
Wei.

677
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,300
I have a lecture to attend.

678
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,340
You guys are heartless.

679
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,100
The two of us will go.

680
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,780
Whatever.

681
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,340
Wonderful.

682
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,220
Yeah, that's it.

683
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,020
Really?

684
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,220
Why is he standing here?

685
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,540
Who knows? He might be waiting for someone.

686
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,980
Standing here?

687
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,180
Let's go.

688
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,580
OK.

689
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,780
You could have called me to talk.

690
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,740
We can talk while walking.

691
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,020
You are being so mysterious.

692
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,100
There must be bad news.

693
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,100
Let's go.

694
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,940
I want to go on a date with you.

695
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,780
So you plan to lie to Lu

696
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,180
and take her to Xie Yixing.

697
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,260
It's Tao Ling's idea.

698
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,500
What idea?

699
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,020
She said

700
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,180
a breakup

701
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,380
was like losing your job
and finding a new job.

702
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,300
Nobody will care about their former employer

703
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,060
if they find better jobs.

704
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,660
Lu still hasn't moved on

705
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,260
from her last relationship

706
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:14,500
because she hasn't found a better boyfriend.

707
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:17,300
We have thought it over.

708
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,820
Xie Yixing

709
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,620
will be a fine boyfriend for her.

710
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,180
We can give him a try.

711
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,460
What's going on in those heads of yours?

712
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,700
That's not the point.

713
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,140
The point is you need to support me.

714
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,860
How?

715
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,140
Go there with me.

716
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,180
Why?

717
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm afraid that Lu will hit me.

718
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,500
We haven't been busy lately.

719
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,940
And the Detective Club

720
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,860
needs to hold some club events.

721
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,860
This doesn't count as a club event.

722
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,380
Saving people comes before anything else.

723
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,540
How can you

724
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,340
let a damsel be trapped in love?

725
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,540
Will you do this with me?

726
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,380
Yeah.

727
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,100
I have even got a name

728
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:09,780
for our event.

729
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,140
It's called "Help for Depression".

730
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,020
What do you think?

731
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,900
I'm regretting a little.

732
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,220
Too late.

733
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,460
I have a question.

734
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:30,980
What is it?

735
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,700
It's like finding a new job.

736
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,460
That makes sense.

737
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,780
There are so many men in this world.

738
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,740
If this man doesn't work for me,
I will find another man.

739
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,540
On second thought,
I don't think it makes sense.

740
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,180
I'm loyal to you.

741
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,020
I would live in widowhood if you died.

742
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,580
Stop pinching my face.

743
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,580
My face is large already.

744
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,940
It can be larger.

745
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,100
(Next Episode)

746
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,100
I have even got a name for our event.

747
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,100
It's called

748
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,420
"Help for Depression".

749
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,180
If you ever want a boyfriend,

750
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,420
let me be your first choice.

751
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,500
Thank you for sharing
your secret base with me.

752
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,980
Look at the glorious fireworks
I've prepared for you.

753
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,980
