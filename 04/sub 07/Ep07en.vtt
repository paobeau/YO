WEBVTT

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760
Love Is All

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.530
Episode 07
Tan Lingyin made the jar by herself
Don't trust Tang Tianyuan and make the bet with him

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.879
My lord.

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:06.000
My lord.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.279
Look.

00:02:08.038 --> 00:02:08.758
What are you doing?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.080
I don't know either.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.360
Yuner and her mother sent this to us.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.920
It's to thank you and adviser's help for saving their lives.

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:17.479
I said no.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.600
But they put down the present and left.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.390
What shall we do?

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.280
Roast duck with soy sauce.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.240
Wait. No spicy.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.559
My lord.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080
We have a chef in our office.

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.160
If you think he's not qualified,

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:39.679
we can find you a new one.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.479
When my lord was cooking,

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:43.720
he was thinking.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.190
This is the new rule of the county office.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.039
Do not disturb him.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.399
Right.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.759
It's our lucky to have such a lord

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.679
who love cooking.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.440
My lord, do whatever you want.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.479
No one will disturb you.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.160
Officer Zheng, this is out of line.

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:01.960
For our lord,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.520
even woman can be an adviser.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.600
The rules have been already stewed as meat

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.880
by our lord.

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.000
Is it delicious?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.639
Yes.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:14.800
Yes. Yes.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.839
If you are tired or hungry,

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:17.720
you can tell me.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.080
I will cook for you every day, okay?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.559
Thank you.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:21.440
Okay.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.320
Why are you eating and drinking,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.800
and I need to transcribe the files?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.320
Because you are my adviser.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.639
It is your duty.

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.839
It smells so good.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.320
Look, my lord.

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:34.960
These are all old cases.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.119
They are all closed.

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.960
Can I transcribe them in another day?

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.399
No.

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.559
There are so many tomorrows.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.800
I quite! I want to eat!

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.199
Your honor said no. Don't you hear that?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.199
I will sue you for abusing your subordinates.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.759
Beat the imperial drum, do you understand?

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.639
If you don't,

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.600
go to find Li Dawang.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.399
Let him teach you.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.880
It smells so good.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.679
My lord.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.320
Wine and animals are ready.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.320
Didn't I ask you to

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.399
throw them away before?

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:09.160
I...I...

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.240
My lord. I don't know what the monster is.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.880
It kicked me out just by one kick.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.279
Are your broadswords and sticks

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:17.239
just for show?

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.678
My lord.

00:04:18.678 --> 00:04:20.558
What Xiaoliu said is all true.

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.320
It is even more cunning

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.119
than Zhang Zhiyuan

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.359
of Tian Xiang Club.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.040
Really? Let me have a look.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.359
So cute.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.359
My lord.

00:04:33.359 --> 00:04:33.839
No way.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.679
I didn't say anything yet.

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:37.480
I say no even you didn't say.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.320
Why are you so stingy?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.519
You can give it to me.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:40.000
Fine.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:42.279
In here, you and this stuff,

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.399
only one can stay. You choose.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.119
But I'm a female adviser.

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:47.399
I need a bodyguard.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.600
How about we give it a three-day trials?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.480
Okay. But we don't need

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.560
the trash who doesn't do anything but eat.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.920
If you can't domesticate it in three days,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.359
you'll leave with it together.

00:04:58.359 --> 00:04:59.000
Don't worry.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.279
I'm sure it'll be well-trained.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.000
The feather is everywhere.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.160
Come here.

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.239
You look as strong as me.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.119
Then take my last name.

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:14.920
I'll call you Tan Baba.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.300
Whatever you want to eat all my treat.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.640
You can't touch this.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.320
Except for this.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.140
I'll cut the vegetable for you.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.320
Wait for me.

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.760
Oh, no.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.839
It's just a jar.

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.200
I'll compensate you one.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.720
Compensate? How can you compensate me?

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:49.760
This old jar is a collection of the best quartz

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.670
from the Kanto region,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040
and the best feldspar from Luoyang Xijing.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.559
It's fired by dalbergia odorifera and rosewood.

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:58.390
It's the only one in the world, the only one.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:59.640
How can you compensate it?

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:02.359
For the past 3 years,

00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:04.440
your honor only eats soup which cooked by this old jar.

00:06:06.239 --> 00:06:08.559
Isn't it just a small jar?

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.610
Why so serious?

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.359
How can a vulgar man

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:13.079
know the feeling?

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:18.200
You elegant man are so hypocritical.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.410
What did you say?

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:25.760
Nothing.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.440
It's my fault. Please punish me.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.700
What kind of punishment will restore this old jar?

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.440
It's fine.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.040
Ask Xihulu to come and clean up.

00:06:36.359 --> 00:06:36.959
Yes.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.920
Don't get your hand hurt.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.890
It's all your fault.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.320
So clumsily.

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.399
It's all your fault. Tan Baba.

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:09.760
Sis.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:14.239
You've been up all night

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:15.799
just for imitating his handwriting.

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:16.799
This fan.

00:07:16.799 --> 00:07:18.880
We have to sell a dozen books to get it back.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.030
Does it look similar?

00:07:22.679 --> 00:07:23.600
Right, sis.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.559
Did Magistrate Tang really know your identity?

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.079
He didn't blame you

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.799
or let you take the responsibility?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.519
No.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.799
It seems like he knew it long time ago.

00:07:35.799 --> 00:07:36.600
But he said nothing.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:41.040
He knew your real identity,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.519
but he didn't blame you.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.959
It means he knows what is the right and wrong.

00:07:45.679 --> 00:07:47.279
Why do you always pick on him?

00:07:48.239 --> 00:07:49.679
No, I don't.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.839
Just a fan.

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:52.480
Besides.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.600
I'm imitating Tong Tianyuan's signature.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.760
Not him, Tang Feilong.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.359
Why will he be angry?

00:08:00.359 --> 00:08:01.799
When I've made enough money,

00:08:01.799 --> 00:08:03.440
I'll go back to the capital,

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.959
and find Tang Tianyuan.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.970
What are you thinking?

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.519
I didn't expect that

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.000
out adviser Tan is Miaomiaosheng.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.190
Every injustice has its perpetrator and every debt its debtor.

00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:23.839
May I ask how will you punish her?

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.640
Punish her.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.279
We just find out the truth of the Qi Hui's case.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:30.040
And the origin of the bad gold has not been found yet.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.720
I don't have time to think about that.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:32.670
You always have a point.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.860
How's the investigation I asked you to do?

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.000
Assistant Zhou, he is clear.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.080
As he said,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.039
he has waited for years

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.440
to take this position.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.799
About adviser Tan's situation,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.039
you know much better than me.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:47.080
The same as your Baba.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.640
My Baba?

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:51.679
It's her Baba!

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.239
So should we keep investigating?

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.000
I think the most important thing right now

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.080
is to find out the truth of the gold mine case.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.359
Miss.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.320
Look at this one.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.400
Fine texture, exquisite workmanship.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.080
It's even unique in Tongling.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.719
Do you like it?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.559
If you don't like them all,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.640
then we have no more good stuff.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.440
Thank you.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:26.599
Come again.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.359
Have a look.

00:09:35.239 --> 00:09:36.320
Please have a look.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.359
Here you are.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.280
I'm here.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.159
Find out what the relationship

00:09:44.159 --> 00:09:46.760
between the female adviser and Tang Feilong is.

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:48.080
Adviser Tan.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.479
Fresh vegetables.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.960
You are?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.640
Why are you so upset?

00:09:57.599 --> 00:09:58.520
What can I help you?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.039
There's something wrong with this gold.

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:11.520
What? Do you think it's too little?

00:10:12.599 --> 00:10:13.760
As the saying goes,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.880
70% is cyan; 80% is yellow; 95% is red. This is cyan.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.960
We can barely call it gold.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.280
What's wrong with it?

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.280
The gold color made by the court

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.400
should not be like this.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.039
Only those small workshops from underclass

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.440
will make something like this

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.950
because they don't have the skills.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.239
Underclass?

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.350
You mean

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.700
what Sun Bufan said is true.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.750
Qi Hui and Sun Bufan are both from rich families.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.880
I don't think they will use somthing like this

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.700
to fool people.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:43.719
Right.

00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:46.039
Speaking of the gold,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.479
only adviser Tan cares about it the most.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.239
By the way, how about her bookstore?

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.320
It is really good.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.350
Anything related to earn money,

00:10:56.359 --> 00:10:58.200
every sec is important for our adviser.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960
Right. When the Qi Hui's case is closed,

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:03.640
the Volume One of Detective Series has come out.

00:11:04.599 --> 00:11:05.559
I have to say that

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.159
our adviser Tan does things in moderation.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.950
She didn't mention anything that she shouldn't in the novel.

00:11:10.119 --> 00:11:11.359
But she said a lot of words

00:11:11.359 --> 00:11:12.719
to praise you.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:15.960
Isn't it all true?

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.919
You must feel sweet now.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:20.880
Right.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.000
The Gutang Bookstore is in a competition.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.080
Turns out the fairy girl

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080
who officer Zheng talks about is you.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.080
Just call me Ruyi.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.880
Although officer Zheng is careless,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.440
he's serious to relationship.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.719
You are so kind

00:11:35.719 --> 00:11:37.080
to make a jar by yourself.

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:40.670
It's my fault to break the jar.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.080
I need to compensate him a new one.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.120
Magistrate Tang cares about it so much.

00:11:44.479 --> 00:11:46.200
I searched all over Tongling.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.840
And I didn't find any good five-color porcelain.

00:11:48.559 --> 00:11:51.440
Actually the clay of the old jar is not expensive.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.039
It's just not easy to find.

00:11:53.039 --> 00:11:55.000
But there's a kind of clay on top of Mount Tianmu.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.440
Although the quality is not as good as this,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.280
if it's fired properly,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.510
it will probably be 70% to 80% similar to the original one.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.479
Really?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.559
Did you know each other in the capital?

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:11.559
Gem!

00:12:13.359 --> 00:12:14.760
We are so lucky.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.159
Good.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.320
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.190
Nice to see you here.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.000
The Couplet Competition, sponsored by Gutang Bookstore,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.119
will begin.

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:30.200
Please come on stage.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.599
Okay.

00:12:31.599 --> 00:12:33.030
This is our first line.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.280
The phoenix falls on the sycamore,

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.880
the sycamore falls on the phoenix.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.039
This is the competition you said?

00:12:37.799 --> 00:12:39.960
Yes. The literature competition is also a competition.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.479
I'll do it.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.760
A pearl joins a jade and a jade joins a pearl.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.119
Good.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.300
The mountains are linked by water and the moon,

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.880
the water is linked by mountains.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.919
Good.

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.320
The boat follows the tide,

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.320
the waves follow the boat.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.760
Good.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.300
the wind shakes the willow flakes,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.350
the willow shakes the wind.

00:13:10.359 --> 00:13:11.400
Good.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.560
That's our Tongling's top four talents.

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.340
They're all the same.

00:13:17.359 --> 00:13:18.960
Not only your second lines are similar,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.359
but also your preference.

00:13:20.359 --> 00:13:22.719
They're all fans sold by our Gutang Bookstore.

00:13:22.719 --> 00:13:23.280
Of course.

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:34.359
My lord.

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:36.719
Assistant Zhou?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.150
I think the Sun Bufan's case

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.230
needs to be opened again.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.799
Then what do you think?

00:13:46.479 --> 00:13:48.159
You should remember my mistake.

00:13:48.919 --> 00:13:51.640
If I had given the hosts the convenience,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.760
I will not be a little assistant in a small country.

00:13:55.119 --> 00:13:56.960
I regret it all the time, my lord.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.200
You are new here and has no foundation.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:02.320
If you want to be a good magistrate,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.960
the most important thing is

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.440
be nice with the nobles of the county.

00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.239
Why don't you give convenience

00:14:07.239 --> 00:14:08.559
to landlord Sun by this case?

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.900
I'm sure he will be grateful to you.

00:14:13.039 --> 00:14:16.039
But Sun Bufan confessed to killing a man

00:14:16.039 --> 00:14:18.000
in front of everyone.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.799
It is hard to

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.920
appeal against his conviction.

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.119
This.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.239
Sun Bufan killed her for a reason.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.470
Please send him into exile instead of the death penalty .

00:14:31.799 --> 00:14:33.479
And he can wait for the pardon.

00:14:33.479 --> 00:14:34.590
It is okay.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:35.900
How much did you get from them?

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.520
My lord.

00:14:43.119 --> 00:14:44.320
How do you know?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.479
I did receive some money.

00:14:48.479 --> 00:14:50.880
But all I considered is for you.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.880
If you think I'm wrong,

00:14:53.479 --> 00:14:55.479
I will give you half of the money.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.340
Two hundred taels.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.050
Four hundred taels.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.000
This number is bad.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.080
My father is sick.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.080
And my mother is old.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.440
Fine. I won't take yours.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.080
Did you see adviser?

00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:20.159
No.

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:21.719
Find her.

00:15:21.719 --> 00:15:22.799
Tell her to come to the study.

00:15:47.039 --> 00:15:47.679
Mr. Tan?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.820
You haven't slept yet.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.710
What are you doing?

00:15:53.159 --> 00:15:54.679
My sister wants to watch fireworks.

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:55.599
I'll make one for her.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.370
Do you know how to do it?

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.039
Just follow instructions in the book.

00:16:03.039 --> 00:16:05.400
Mr. Tan, you are so kind.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.080
No matter what sister Lingyin wants,

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.400
you can make them for her.

00:16:12.719 --> 00:16:13.359
My lord!

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.230
Where have you been to earn money?

00:16:19.039 --> 00:16:19.760
What do you mean?

00:16:20.359 --> 00:16:22.440
Seems like you take huge advantages of my fan.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:26.359
You knew it.

00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:29.000
But that is fake.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.400
So.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.799
You admit you copied my fan.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.620
It's enough to pass off the fake as the real thing, right?

00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:38.719
Why?

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.280
Paintings of masters will be imitated

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.799
by future generations sooner or later.

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:45.320
I was just one step ahead.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.479
It's not upright to make a fake.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:51.410
Good things should be shared with each other.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.000
The fan with you

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.359
only makes you happy.

00:16:54.359 --> 00:16:55.799
And now, everyone is happy.

00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.840
You are so cunning.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.660
I make money on my own way.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.960
You only care about the money.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.680
I don't wanna talk with you now.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.479
If I only care about the money,

00:17:10.479 --> 00:17:11.560
why should I give you this?

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:15.839
Little Huang also needs a drinking bowl.

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.310
This is perfect for it.

00:17:36.719 --> 00:17:38.000
I'll give you the fan back tomorrow.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.839
Save it to yourself.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.010
I will not take back the thing I give.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.520
What's wrong with you and adviser?

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.640
How should I know?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.590
I just broke a jar. Why is she so angry?

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:55.599
The jar.

00:17:56.719 --> 00:17:58.079
Adviser has been working hard for days

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:59.680
to make this jar.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.839
You. You just broke it like that?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:04.850
She made it herself?

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.560
There's only one woman in our office.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:12.460
You should go to the bookstore more often,

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.900
and take more care of adviser's daily activities.

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:16.800
That's a pity.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.300
Do not step on it.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.640
I need to glue it up.

00:18:22.479 --> 00:18:23.680
I really don't understand you.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:24.520
I will leave now.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.719
Come in.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.640
Qingchen, you can't sleep at night?

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.820
Aren't you the one who's not sleeping?

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.140
My lord?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.830
I will take you to a place.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.160
Take me here to work in the midnight.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.239
I am your adviser!

00:19:21.239 --> 00:19:22.599
I am not your Muskmelon.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.140
Are you still mad at me?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.520
How dare I am?

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:30.820
Don't worry.

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:32.800
My bookstore is over there. I won't run away.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.359
I'll pay you back

00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.520
all the money of selling fans.

00:19:37.439 --> 00:19:38.079
I want cash.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:41.040
Normally, a man would just wave his hand

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.400
and say, "No, that's okay".

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.850
It's what you said to pay me back all the money.

00:19:46.479 --> 00:19:47.439
Incense bags.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.880
You're out of line.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.640
Good-look incense bags.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.439
Here you are.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.359
I didn't know you made that jar by yourself.

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:32.010
Sorry.

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:34.920
It's me who broke your jar.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.170
I should compensate you another.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:38.130
But that one was broken.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.199
I can't fix it anymore.

00:20:39.199 --> 00:20:40.839
So I can only go to Mount Tianmu,

00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:42.119
get some mud and make one for you.

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.640
You dug up the mud yourself?

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.119
Lady Zhou went there with me.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.719
She's the beauty who officer zheng talked about.

00:21:10.479 --> 00:21:11.719
I heard you want to go to the capital?

00:21:14.119 --> 00:21:16.280
I want to go to the capital and see my Tang Tianyuan.

00:21:18.119 --> 00:21:18.599
And then?

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.760
Say "thank you" to him.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:24.560
That's it?

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.680
Didn't you say you wanna marry him?

00:21:28.479 --> 00:21:30.160
I am a self-aware person,

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.800
okay?

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:32.640
So the novel this time you wrote

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:34.439
is still about him.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:37.560
No. It's the story about you.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:41.520
About what?

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.040
Don't be conceited.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.719
I just use your life story

00:21:46.719 --> 00:21:47.400
for convenience.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.680
It's on fire!

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.280
It's on fire over there?!

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.040
Where is it?

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:55.079
What is going on?

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:57.280
It's on fire. Put out the fire.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.880
Come on. Put out the fire.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.160
What is going on?

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.239
It's on fire.

00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:03.280
Put out the fire.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.400
Come on.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.760
Are you okay?

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.199
I'm fine. Sis. Don't worry.

00:22:11.199 --> 00:22:12.680
It's just the gunpowder exploded.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:14.680
Why do you make gunpowder?

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.959
Didn't expect that your brother

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:17.719
had a hobby for inventions.

00:22:17.719 --> 00:22:18.560
No.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.719
It's because there's a popular romance novel said that

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.880
men and women need an atmosphere to get along.

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.230
And no woman could refuse a man

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:27.860
who would set off fireworks for her.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.599
Bullshit.

00:22:30.439 --> 00:22:31.520
Don't believe this crap.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:35.760
Are you really okay?

00:22:36.719 --> 00:22:38.359
The house burned down like this.

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:39.640
How about you live in the office?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:40.810
Really?

00:22:42.199 --> 00:22:43.760
Then what about my brother?

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.719
Sis, I can stay at hotel.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:46.160
It's for free.

00:22:47.719 --> 00:22:48.719
Together.

00:22:48.719 --> 00:22:51.520
What about Fang and Zhuang?

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.040
The West Room is huge.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:53.880
Thank you, my lord!

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:06.000
What's this?

00:23:15.719 --> 00:23:16.400
Chicken soup?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.430
My lord. It's been over one night.

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.560
Can't eat it anymore.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.790
Autumn is coming. And it's cold now.

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.160
It's not that perishable.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.040
Warm it up then send back.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:30.920
My lord.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.990
You never eat any overnight dish.

00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:36.640
It's soup, not a dish.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.520
Go.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:39.880
Yes.

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.439
My lord, have some plum juice.

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:03.599
Hey guys! What's wrong with you?

00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:05.439
Didn't I pay you?

00:24:05.439 --> 00:24:09.110
Cry louder, louder!

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:10.000
Do you hear that?

00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.839
That was scary.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:16.400
My lord.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.400
How many times did I tell you.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.640
Don't yell.

00:24:27.079 --> 00:24:29.560
And don't be too hard also.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.520
We're not here to sing.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.920
What are we doing here?

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.479
We're here to collect a debt.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.080
I'll say it again. Listen carefully.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.760
Concentrate the drool on the throat.

00:24:40.439 --> 00:24:41.959
On the throat.

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:44.479
Follow me. One, two.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.920
Right.

00:24:48.719 --> 00:24:50.880
My daughter.

00:24:53.479 --> 00:24:54.680
What are you doing?

00:24:55.850 --> 00:24:56.660
They're gonna beat us!

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:58.350
The murderer's father is gonna beat us!

00:24:58.359 --> 00:25:01.000
What's wrong with you?

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.760
My daughter will never come back.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.280
I still have a disappointing son to raise.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.119
My daughter, you just left.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.439
When you're in Hades,

00:25:18.439 --> 00:25:20.079
you must sue him.

00:25:20.079 --> 00:25:22.319
Let Yama keep an eye on their family.

00:25:22.319 --> 00:25:24.359
And make sure they'll die...

00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:27.319
My lord. My lord.

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:28.119
Die painfully.

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:29.880
My lord, how about we just blow them away?

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.839
How?!

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.500
Do you think the young master is not guilty enough?!

00:25:34.439 --> 00:25:36.640
My lord. My lord.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:41.240
We've known each other for decades.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.830
Stop acting.

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:50.719
The bureau for foreign shipping now needs a young director.

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:52.239
Your son is on the right age.

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.839
He's been sailing for years. You can ask him to come.

00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:58.239
I'll give him this position. What do you think?

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.359
Just wake up.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.760
Get me up.

00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:10.319
What are you doing?

00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:11.479
Wait. Wait.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.560
My daughter was killed by your son.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.599
I feel so painful. It really hurts.

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:21.839
Ridiculous. For your daughter?

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.520
If you do this for your daughter,

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.640
you should be in the county office now,

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.239
and ask Tang Feilong kill my son.

00:26:29.839 --> 00:26:32.199
Are you here to get justice for your daughter?

00:26:33.359 --> 00:26:37.199
You're looking for a way out for your son.

00:26:40.479 --> 00:26:43.319
The county office is also a place of humanity.

00:26:44.079 --> 00:26:46.800
I can apply for interceding as the father of Qi Hui.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.280
Then Bufan can continue to

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.040
do filial piety to you.

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:56.230
Now you say something like a human.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.140
Now you can tell me

00:26:58.839 --> 00:27:02.359
if you'll be able to help

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.680
my son take the position of bureau.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:06.520
Of course.

00:27:08.199 --> 00:27:12.280
The point is if you can let it over.

00:27:16.479 --> 00:27:19.400
My lord, vent one is hatred better than create more enemy!

00:27:20.359 --> 00:27:23.119
Besides, we were friends for long time.

00:27:23.839 --> 00:27:28.160
We're like a real family with each other, right?

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.359
Yes, my lord.

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.239
My lord.

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:39.199
Our families are going to rebuild our relationship.

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:41.959
Yes. We are now a family again.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.800
Now, his daughter is gone.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.599
Doesn't that mean

00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:50.520
my daughter's gone?

00:27:51.719 --> 00:27:54.079
Now my son Bufan,

00:27:55.119 --> 00:27:57.880
if he is also gone,

00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:58.400
then

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.560
it means your son is also gone, right?

00:28:01.199 --> 00:28:01.800
Isn't it?

00:28:06.479 --> 00:28:08.040
I can understand your feelings.

00:28:09.599 --> 00:28:10.599
But why does it sound

00:28:10.599 --> 00:28:12.839
like I killed your children?

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:16.280
I dare not.

00:28:17.439 --> 00:28:18.000
Look.

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:22.959
This is a little gift.

00:28:34.599 --> 00:28:36.599
My lord. What do you think?

00:28:39.199 --> 00:28:41.479
But that is your daughter.

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.280
Right.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.160
But my lord.

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.760
Bufan.

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:52.880
I've watched him growing up.

00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:55.359
He is just like my half-son.

00:28:56.359 --> 00:28:59.640
My daughter is already gone.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.400
My daughter.

00:29:03.599 --> 00:29:05.119
What's wrong, brother?!

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:05.680
Brother!

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.650
Brother. Are you okay, my brother?!

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:10.230
Impudence!

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:14.479
It is my duty to enforce the law impartially.

00:29:19.719 --> 00:29:21.800
But if you get out of the county office,

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.439
and you still think I manage this county well,

00:29:25.439 --> 00:29:26.599
work the case hard,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.400
It's not too late

00:29:31.199 --> 00:29:32.319
to give me these gold.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.400
Thanks, my lord.

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:38.800
We understand.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:52.950
The money from selling fans are all here.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:53.980
You can count yourself.

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.199
Don't you wanna restructure your bookstore?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:57.840
Take it.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.199
I don't wanna use your money.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:01.960
Dirty money.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.040
What you said to landlord Sun,

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.119
I heard them all.

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.000
Landlord Qi asked for reconciliation.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.400
So everything's ready now but my permission.

00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:15.839
So you can lose your conscience,

00:30:15.839 --> 00:30:17.160
take bribes and bend the law?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:20.199
The case hasn't closed. I can't tell you anything.

00:30:20.199 --> 00:30:21.119
You don't have to.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.880
Now you are a corrupt official

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880
in my heart.

00:30:25.439 --> 00:30:26.640
I'll gather the evidence,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.110
go to the capital and prosecute you. Wait for it.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.510
Come back.

00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:33.920
I, Tan Lingyin,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.479
won't come back just because you tell me to.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.719
Didn't you just come back?

00:30:37.719 --> 00:30:38.479
Just for once.

00:30:41.079 --> 00:30:42.760
Do you dare make a bet with me, Tan Lingyin?

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.319
For what?

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:48.359
If I can find a way to

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:50.040
not to offend landlord Sun,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.040
and send Sun Bufan to the jail,

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:54.320
you need to promise me one condition.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.040
A person who worships the golden calf like you.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.000
How can I trust you?

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.680
Why do you talk so much?

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.760
Do you dare to bet or not?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.479
Sure. Why not?!

00:31:05.479 --> 00:31:07.479
If Sun Bufan can be executed,

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:09.040
I'll do whatever you want from now on.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.800
But if you are gonna let him off the hook

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:11.560
for corruption,

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:14.479
you need to pay me double the gold he gave you.

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:14.920
Okay?

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.680
Okay.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.400
But if you lose,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.439
you need to pay me double.

00:31:19.439 --> 00:31:23.040
Also, you need to say 3 words to me

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:24.480
in front of the whole county.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:29.540
Say what?

00:31:30.719 --> 00:31:31.319
My lord.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.000
Are you...

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.319
Which three words do you think?

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.439
It's...

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.319
This is embarrassing. I can't say it.

00:31:44.319 --> 00:31:45.830
If you lose,

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.400
say it to me

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.690
in front of everyone.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.360
Do you wanna play fire?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.439
Sure, I'm not afraid.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.260
You're curious about that too.

00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:21.710
I'm afraid you and your brother

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:23.390
will blow up the whole Tongling County again.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.060
Is it that hard to be honest?

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.640
Don't you just have nothing to do?

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:31.240
Right.

00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.000
Do you really think Sunjie's gold

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.040
is in Mount Tianmu?

00:32:35.719 --> 00:32:36.280
Maybe.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:37.599
Then shouldn't we

00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:39.040
ask landlord Sun for something?

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.000
Ask what? The bet is not done yet.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.400
It's too early to say anything.

00:32:45.439 --> 00:32:48.280
If you have a way to balance Sun and Qi families

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.839
and win the bet,

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:52.680
why are you playing fire with me here?

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.520
Right.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.570
Bring me that paper and writing brush.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.319
For what?

00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:01.560
Write the bet.

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:05.400
I'm afraid someone will deny if she lose.

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.439
Whatever. I'm not afraid.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.760
You know you will lose, but you still wanna bet.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.079
Is this a trap?

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:29.560
You won't come back anymore.

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:32.319
Now you're dead.

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.359
Don't blame me for paving the way for your brother.

00:33:38.079 --> 00:33:41.000
Please bless your brother that his official career will be successful.

00:33:41.599 --> 00:33:42.560
And blessing your father

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.000
goes smoothly.

00:33:48.439 --> 00:33:49.560
Hui'er.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.800
My lord, the carriage is ready.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.560
I'm going.

00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:12.840
I don't know

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.360
how much I owe my ungrateful son

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:18.280
in my life.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.120
Recalling sad things is not good for your health.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:23.879
You should take care of yourselves.

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.600
Brother, how about this.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.360
Your daughter is died now.

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:32.080
No, she's not died. She will always be in my heart.

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.360
From now on,

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.040
our family Sun will always take your daughter

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.800
as my son's wife.

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:43.879
My son will always be your son-in-law.

00:34:44.438 --> 00:34:47.279
He'll do everything he can for your family.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:49.080
What do you think?

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:49.800
Right.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:54.399
Son-in-law. Good son-in-law.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.360
Let's toast to Magistrate Tang.

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.439
Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:05.520
I don't drink.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.760
But don't worry.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.760
This case still has another way to deal with it.

00:35:13.879 --> 00:35:15.679
Tang Feilong.

00:35:17.399 --> 00:35:18.560
I'll record it all!

00:35:20.239 --> 00:35:22.479
My lord. I have something to report.

00:35:26.479 --> 00:35:29.040
What's wrong with you? Is there any outsider here?

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.879
My lord, this.

00:35:29.879 --> 00:35:30.399
Just say it.

00:35:32.159 --> 00:35:33.199
This inspector's team

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.199
has sent a handwriting order of the imperial envoy.

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:36.919
Imperial envoy?

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:39.879
Imperial envoy is coming.

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:46.239
My lord.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:54.840
My lord.

00:36:01.879 --> 00:36:02.439
It says

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.800
the imperial envoy

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.280
received anonymous report

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.199
that I received a heavy bribe

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.230
and have collusion with merchant.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.420
It also says that

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:14.719
Qi Hui's case

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.270
will be reported to the capital for rehearing.
