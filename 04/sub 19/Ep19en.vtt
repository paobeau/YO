32
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.820
It's currently county office working hours. Sir Tang,

33
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.910
you are a salaried official so you shouldn't disappoint the imperial court.

34
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.120
Don't go.

35
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.170
What?

36
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.420
You're already here, so let's not waste time.

37
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.570
Sit.


39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.300
What are you doing?

40
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.880
Dissecting you.

41
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.100
Are you crazy?

42
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.730
What are you doing? Even if you want to break up, you don't need to use a knife! 
 <i>[Mortuary]</i>

43
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.680
If you want to be with Jiang Muchun, you can just go!

44
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.400
Isn't this how it's written in your stories?

45
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.940
You can marry whoever you want. On your wedding day, I'll be sure to send you my blessings.

46
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.810
"Wishing you a loving and lasting marriage; A harmonious relationship makes every day blossom."

47
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.550
How about that?

48
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.880
You wrote in your stories that you have to dissect their heart in order to truly understand them.

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.100
Don't raise a knife when you're saying sweet things.

50
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.480
Whatever, I'll teach you next time. I'm leaving.

51
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.710
The moon is really round tonight.

52
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.380
Really?

53
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.130
It is!

54
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.140
What are you doing?

55
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.390
Lo-Lo-Lo-Looking at the moon.

<i> ♫ I am so, so, so captivated by you like this ♫ </i>

57
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.760

60
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.380
The moon is so beautiful tonight. Let's not waste it.

61
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.030
What else?

62
00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.700
<i> ♫ I want to accompany you to go catch the wind ♫</i>

63

<i> ♫ Daydreaming together, a dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

64
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.320
I won't kiss someone else's man.

65
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.500
Are you jealous of others?

66
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.820
Others?

67
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.250
What others? Do you not know their names? Others, others, others, who are the others?

68
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.400
Jiang Muchun. She approached us with a motive.

69
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.050
Before finding out her motive, you can't be careless.

70
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.500
What motive can she have? Isn't it just to marry you?

71
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.530
It's not that simple. Other than the emperor,

72
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.820
nobody knows that Tang Feilong is Tang Tianyuan. How does she know?

73
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:51.110
Also, why did she appear right at this time?

74
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.000
It's probably because she asked the emperor. She's your fiancée after all.

75
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.320
A fiancée should be waiting at home for her lover to return.

76
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.110
There's no way she doesn't understand this concept.

77
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.900
So what? She probably couldn't wait.

78
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.060
Plus, who says women have to be passive and just wait?

79
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.790
You're taking her side?

80
00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.650
Jiang Muchun is good at everything. Everyone in the county office likes her.

81
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.500
What about me? I can't do anything and I only cause trouble. How can I compare to her?

82
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.910
If you keep talking, I'm going to change my mind.

83
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.940
It's true.

84
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.740
Jiang Muchun likes you and I'm not in a position to make her stay away from you.

85
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.680
On this matter, you also have to decide for yourself.

86
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.030
I also don't know how to stay calm when I'm facing you two.

87
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.620
So I think we should separate for a while.

88
00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.680
Until you've thought it through.

89
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.100
I was joking!

90
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.350
Think about it.

91
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.350
Don't even think about standing on both boats! 
 <i>(T/N: two-timing)</i>

92
00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.830
You said Miss Ruyi was abandoned.

93
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.480
Then... Then how did she become your younger cousin?

94
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.800
This...

95
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.930
My father pitied her so he took her in.

96
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.550
But he was afraid that Aunt would be upset so he left her to be raised by another family.

97
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.350
He would only send money, clothes, and food regularly.

98
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.950
Her late father that she mentioned... is that her adoptive father?

99
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.950
She grew up as a beggar.

100
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.740
She's so pitiful. So pitiful.

101
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.160
Head Constable Zheng.

102
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.500
Head Constable Zheng!

103
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.750
Head Constable Zheng!

104
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.870
You can't eat this, it's for Miss Ruyi.

105
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.580
Whatever.

106
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.830
Look at this.

107
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.960
This... was supposed

108
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.890
to be eaten by Miss Ruyi and me while we enjoyed the moonlight.

109
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.650
It's a shame that it's useless now.

110
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.630
Help me throw it away.

111
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.510
Who uses stir-fried chili and meat as a filling?

112
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.320
But I still need to thank you.

113
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.930
This is the first time someone made mooncakes for me.

114
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:04.760
Sorry, this is the last time.

115
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.680
Duan Feng! Duan Feng, I'm here!

116
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.700
Duan Feng?

117
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.870
Why is the door open?

118
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.910
Who cares.

119
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.750
Duan Feng, I brought good wine and meat.

120
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.220
Wake up!

121
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:45.690
Duan Feng... Duan Feng, are you dead? Duan Feng!

122
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.070
- You...
- I haven't married you yet, I can't die.

123
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.080
Liar. You can't die before telling me.

124
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.230
What did you bring?

125
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.970
The good wine and meat you wanted. Can you tell me now?

126
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.310
<i>Guards, Adviser Tan's going to take Duan Feng and escape!</i>

127
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.080
<i>Block them! Don't let them escape.</i>

128
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.210
- W-What's the meaning of this? 
- Let's go!

129
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.280
Where are we going?

130
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.670
They're already claim that I've escaped. If I stay, then won't I be wrongly accused?

131
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:11.720
Let's go. Hurry, hurry, hurry!

132
00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:19.580
I didn't unlock the door. Let's go back quickly!

133
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:21.250
Go back and let them capture me?

134
00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.850
If we don't go back, then we really will be guilty of breaking out.

135
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.180
Idiot. Can't you tell that someone's trying to harm you? Hold on tight.

136
00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:31.230
Listen to me! If we go and find Sir Tang now, he'll have a solution.

137
00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:34.600
Does the county office belong solely to Sir Tang?

138
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.480
Where is he? What's going on?

139
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.060
This morning, right after changing shifts,

140
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.560
I was knocked out by someone from behind.

141
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.320
When I woke up, I bumped into Adviser Tan and Duan Feng escaping,

142
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.000
then they took the horses and left.

143
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.010
Head Constable Zheng, it really wasn't me being careless.

144
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:04.860
Tongling has always been peaceful.

145
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.900
I never thought this would happen.

146
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:10.050
Tongling is the least peaceful place. You should shut your mouth.

147
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.020
This lock... was opened by a key.

148
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.170
Recently, only Adviser Tan frequently comes to the prison.

149
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.700
Also, she...

150
00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.170
Also, she brought a key.

151
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.320
- Have you seen Zhou Zhengdao? 
 - No.

152
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.690
Head Constable Zheng!

153
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.710
Zhou Zhengdao, come out!

154
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.600
Who is it? Miss Ruyi?

155
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.530
What's all this commotion this morning?

156
00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.160
Your adviser took Duan Feng away.

157

Oh no, she was taken by Duan Feng.

158
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.350
Get your words straight before speaking.

159

Look at the time!  Why are you still caring about this!

160
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:56.170
Hurry, get your horse and people, and go!

161
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.960
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

162
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.160
- Hurry! 
 - Scram!

163
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.330
Hurry! Hurry!

164
00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.730
Chase them!

165
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:32.030
Hurry, chase them!

166
00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.550
Did you wash your hands? They stink.

167
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.990
Is there time to talk about this right now?

168
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.270
I just saved your life.

169
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:45.500
Do you know who knocked you out? Was it the guards?

170
00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.100
Someone drugged my food. They probably wanted to silence me after I escaped.

171
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.880
Luckily, you came to deliver food,

172
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.550
so they could coincidentally implicate you in this mess.

173
00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.570
This way, I'm a fugitive and you're an accomplice. Neither of us can escape.

174
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.430
Did you offend any gangs?

175
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.660
What gangs? I am the gang.

176
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.320
Someone must've been unhappy that I was caught in your hands and wanted me dead.

177
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.130
What did you actually do?

178
00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:18.930
I'm just a bandit committing a crime. Do the authorities need to make such a deliberate plan?

179
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.590
I think that this has something to do with the gold mine case.

180
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:27.040
You were still saying that you know nothing about the gold mine case. Let's just go and find Sir Tang.

181
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.920
Why can't you understand? Tang Feilong won't listen to me.

182
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.590
But he would listen to me.

183
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.600
Hey!

184
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.370
Hero Duan, get out of the way!

185
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:05.990
- Hurry! 
 - Get on!

186
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.010
Move away! Move away!

187
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.510
Oh, you're a hero?

188
00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.770
I've been around in the pugilistic world, just robbing from the rich and giving to the poor.

189
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:32.260
It's their casual nickname for me.

190
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:34.860
What are you going to do now? You can't keep running, Hero Duan.

191
00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.980
I'm already used to it, but you have to get used to it.

192
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.700
Once we get up the mountain, I'll tell you everything.

193
00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.040
Really? You've said it so don't trick me!

194
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.470
- Why would I trick you? 
 - Stop!

195
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.610
Tang Tianyuan.

196
00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.040
A good dog doesn't block the way. Hurry and move aside.

197
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.870
I will think about keeping her alive.

198
00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.310
If you hurt her even a little,

199
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.430
I won't let you leave here alive.

200
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.310
Let's see which is faster: your arrow or my sword.

201
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:08.750
Do you get any benefits from killing her?

202
00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.020
Do I get any benefits from staying in your prison?

203
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.390
I would rather have a quick death,

204
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.870
- and have this woman accompany me on the way. 
 - Don't you dare!

205
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.920
See if I dare or not.

206
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.640
I'm just afraid that you won't bear the pain of being separated from your lover forever.

207

Am I right?

208

Hurry up and get me three thousand taels.

209
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.210
If anyone tries to block me, I'll kill your adviser immediately.

210
00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.660
You won't bear to do that.

211

Didn't we agree that we would be a fairytale couple?

213
00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:46.590
We would spend our lives together happily

214
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.030

215

Yes! I'm lovesick for you. It's incurable.

Sir,

229

Adviser Tan has found her love. This time,

230
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.980
she left with him willingly.

231
00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.360
Sir, you should let her go, too.

232
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.480
Bandits are prevailing in Tongling. The gold mine case is complicated and unpredictable.

233

If Sir Jiang really loves you,

234
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.770
he wouldn't tell you to stay by my side and get into this mess.

235

This letter explains everything clearly.

236
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:52.290
I believe that Sir Jiang will definitely understand.

237
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.650
Sir, are you kicking me out?

The carriage is ready. You can leave anytime.

Why can't you understand my feelings?

240
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.820
This is the jade bracelet you gave me when you were younger.

241
00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:18.890
Since I put it on, I've been unwilling to take it off.

242
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:23.240
Even if I had innumerable jewels, they cannot compare to it.

243
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:28.900
When I wear it, it's as if you are always with me.

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:35.650
I know... that you definitely care for me.

245
00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:38.860
It's just temporary...

246
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:42.510
You've temporarily been seduced by another woman so you can't think clearly.

247
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.750
It's okay.

248
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:49.530
Why are you bothered if I'm not even bothered?

249
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:56.450
I wasn't the one who gave this bracelet to you.

250
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.250
Sir, do you not remember?

251
00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.120
This is what you gave me when we were young, after we fell in love at first sight.

252
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.560
Old Madam specifically had this pair of jade accessories made for us.

253
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.160
One piece is your jade pendant, the other is my jade bracelet.

254
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.470
This piece of jade was found by my mother.

255
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.190
It is uncommonly clear, so it was made into this pendant of mine.

256
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:22.190
But...

257
00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.290
she made a decision without my authority

258
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.340
and without my knowledge

259
00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.230
to make and give you this bracelet.

260
00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.140
Are you saying

261
00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:41.530
that this bracelet was from Old Madam?

262
00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.020
It can't be.

263
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.680
This was given to me by Xi Hulu at that time.

264
00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.560
It definitely represents your intentions.

265
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.220
Xi Hulu is someone who runs errands for the Tang family.

266
00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:58.500
He's not very bright and he doesn't speak clearly.

269
00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.750
I'll apologize on his behalf.

270

My heart already belongs to another.

272

If all this time, you've been ruminating about this jade pendant,

273
00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.550
then you can have it.

274
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:32.180

I was just patrolling on the street and when I turned my head,

I happened to see you snoring on the street.

280

Do you trust me?

317
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.080
No.

318
00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:17.210
Then don't blame me for forcing you to swear to the heavens.

319
00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.990

- Say your name.
 - No.

323
00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.610
I'll kill you if you don't.

324

I won't even if you do.

Stop playing, okay? I can't marry you.

327
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.210
From today onwards, we will be sworn brothers!

We will care for each other in life and death; share wealth and misfortune; Heaven and Earth are our witnesses.

I was able to return thanks to you this time.

I grew up in the pugilistic world so I repay my debts.

331
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.210
Since you're not willing to marry me, then we'll become sworn brothers.

332
00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:15.550
I'll give you a big present in celebration of our new brotherhood.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.420
It's a sign that my wife is thinking of me.

Ruyi, have you heard the story about Boqi consuming dreams? 
 <i>(T/N: Boqi is a mythical creature)</i>

355

Legend says that the beast Boqi loves to eat nightmares.

356
00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:16.520
Children don't have nightmares when Boqi is by their side.

357
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.290
I made a new scent packet for you.

Boqi is embroidered on it.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.190
You won't have nightmares if you keep it with you day and night.

You can also rely on me.

I'm not sleeping!

364
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.410
It's me, not Sir.

365
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:20.110
The nights are cooler as autumn approaches. You need to wear more layers when on night duty.

366
00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:25.200
Is Sir Tang asleep?

367

You have to eat, too. You haven't eaten anything today.

I'm not hungry. You can go and eat.

That won't do. Adviser left clear instructions before she left.

<i>Sir! Sir!</i>

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:08.570
Adviser! Adviser, save me! Hurry and save me! I'm going to die!

386
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.600
He was being suspicious in our mountains!

387
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.010
Tan Lingyin, is this what you mean by sincerity? You sent a spy over?

388
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:18.610
No, I didn't. Xi Hulu, what are you doing here?

389
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.700
Adviser, Sir is in trouble. He fainted.

390
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.570
What?

391
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:26.840
Sir is going to die! What am I going to do?

392
00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.800
That's great! You can regret your decision now to avoid becoming a widow.

393
00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.800
Shut up!

394
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.460
Tell me.

395
00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.940
- He was fine when I left. 
 - I also don't know why.

396
00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.000
Sir just fainted suddenly.

397
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.970
I'm afraid he won't make it so I came here to look for you.

398
00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.800
- Where are you going? 
 - I'm going to find him!

399
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:49.810
I knew you came here under a pretense! Tell me the truth. Why did you come?

400
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:51.660
I purposely told him to let us go.

401
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.860
It was to get close to you and gain your trust.

402
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.300
What's the point of earning a bandit's trust?

403
00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.260
Whether or not we can successfully solve the gold case depends on you.

404
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.600
I know that you don't want to hurt me.

405
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:11.470
Otherwise, there would be a bunch of constables here today.

406
00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:18.130
Let me ask you. Do you really trust him?

407
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.600
Okay, go.

408
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.800
Thank you.

409
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:36.800
But can you do me another favor?

410
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.600
If I help, does that mean I can choose whether you give me

411
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.880
ten thousand pieces of gold, luxury mansions, or beautiful women?

412
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.370
There's no gold, luxury mansions, or beautiful women.

413
00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:50.640
Then, what benefit do I get?

414
00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.640
Justice and fairness. The refugees who died wrongly can rest in peace.

415
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.150
Go!

416
00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:07.830
- Adviser, you're back. 
 - Adviser.

417
00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.060
This person... I've seen him before.

418
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.700
Where was it again?

419
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.980
Sir! Sir!

420
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:32.750
You scared me.

421
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.180
What's going on?

422
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.340
Why are you back?

423
00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:40.280
Xi Hulu said you fainted so I didn't feel like acting anymore. Does it hurt?

424
00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:47.940
Please could this masked hero put down my carved Ruyao vase.

425
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:59.930
How are you sick? To me, you are still as annoying as ever.

426
00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:02.000
Du-Duan Feng?

427
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.510
Don't get excited. I just came to take a look. I'm leaving soon.

428
00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.650
What did the doctor say?

429
00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:10.020
The doctor said that somebody missed you so much he got sick.

430
00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.290
Talk properly.

431
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:13.900
He was overworked and overly anxious.

432
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.130
What else?

433
00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:19.990
It's nothing serious. They're just exaggerating. Don't worry.

434
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.680
Which quack told you that you worked too much?

435
00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.790
Do you constantly experience numbness and spasms in your arms?

436
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:34.350
Also, do you often feel that your body is not within your control?

437
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.600
I swear to the heavens, I didn't say it.

438
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:42.130
This kind of poison is called strychnine. It's also known as Qianji poison.

439
00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.630
Sir, did you touch anything dirty with your hands?

440
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.820
This is it. Sang Jie used this to kill the refugees.

441
00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.830
Sir, it looks like someone wants to kill you without anyone noticing.

442
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.550
Where did you get this medicine?

443
00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:09.320
Xue Li has been with me since childhood. She wouldn't poison me.

444
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.520
You two should leave first.

445
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:17.450
I want to have a private chat with this doctor.

I waited for you for a long time. Let's go now.

455
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.710
Those who were involved in mining were mostly refugees.

456
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.650
Everyone's neck was marked with an ink tattoo.

457
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.100
So you're also a refugee. How did you escape?

458
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.410
Old Tie was Sang Jie's housekeeper and the one responsible for hiding the gold.

459
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:37.170
He told me Sang Jie would kill us.

460
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:41.700
So we decided to take a chance and run away with the gold.

461
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.940
My mission was to lead the refugees who survived

462
00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.490
to the mountains before Sang Jie noticed and form a gang.

463
00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.040
Then find an opportunity to save Old Tie?

464
00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:56.520
Where is this person?

465
00:36:56.520 --> 00:36:58.280

Sir, I'm here to apply medicine for you.

467
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:11.460

473
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.300
<i> ♫ A fierce horse, where is it going in this mortal world? ♫</i>

474
00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:01.600
<i> ♫ Where can I leisurely see to the limit of the cloud and stars ♫</i>

475
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.760
<i> ♫ On an ancient road, as the sun sets,
 I asked the young bamboo ♫</i>

476
00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.800
<i> ♫ When will you reply? ♫</i>

477
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.150
<i> ♫ Only when you come here boundless ♫</i>

478
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:20.600
<i> ♫ Can you drink till drunk ♫</i>

479
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:24.140
<i> ♫ To also leave boundless ♫</i>

480
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.810
<i> ♫ Freely pick a song  ♫</i>

481
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.100
<i> ♫ A good dream, a youth’s travels ♫</i>

482
00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:36.880
<i> ♫  The swaying shadows from the candle and 
longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

483
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.500
<i> ♫ Who is lamenting under the moon?  ♫</i>

484
00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.260
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

485
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:50.550
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

486
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:59.700
<i> ♫ A single flourishing blossom tree is hazier 
after being hit by the rain ♫</i>

487
00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:05.860
<i> ♫ A lonely lit lamp reflects onto the paper window endlessly ♫</i>

488
00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:09.590
<i> ♫ Endlessly, it cannot end, this spring flower ♫</i>

489
00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:14.600
<i> ♫ Seeing the dried up vines and hearing the winters crows, 
too busy to rest ♫</i>

490
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.900
<i> ♫ A stream of west wind, welcomes Tusu (wine), in pursuit ♫</i>

491
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:25.580
<i> ♫ In pursuit of the four seasons, the oceans, but I hesitate ♫</i>

492
00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.600
<i> ♫ When the brush stops, the wind stops, sleep stops ♫</i>

493
00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.960
<i> ♫ The long journey home ♫</i>

494
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.350
<i> ♫ Only when you come here boundless ♫</i>

495
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:44.800
<i> ♫ Can you drink till drunk ♫</i>

496
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.210
<i> ♫ To also leave boundless ♫</i>

497
00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:51.040
<i> ♫ Freely pick a song. ♫</i>

498
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.200
<i> ♫ A good dream, a youth’s travels ♫</i>

499
00:39:54.200 --> 00:40:00.850
<i> ♫  The swaying shadows from the candle and 
longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

500
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:04.600
<i> ♫ Who is lamenting under the moon? ♫</i>

501
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.260
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

502
00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:14.230
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

503
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:20.780
<i> ♫ Listen to the wind ♫</i>

504
00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.100
<i> ♫ Accompanied by pear blossoms, I drink until drunk  ♫ </i>

505
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:31.320
<i>♫ And another cup ♫</i>
