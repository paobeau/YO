No, it's because I may not let you eat.

Look at me. Look at me.

Look in front of you. Enjoy your breakfast with the countryside view.

Is this what you call lovers who look at the same things (have the same goals)?

Well, you can look at the front, side, and back.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.830
No matter how shameless you are, you can't do this. How dare you ask for money?

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.730
If I had a choice, I wouldn't have.

Why are you looking for Hari?

Since she's my daughter, I'm looking for her because I miss her!

Hari doesn't have a father.

I don't have room for anyone else.

98
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.700
You always gave your heart away, even if you got hurt.

99
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.960
I wish you could be harsher and more shrewd and consider your feelings first.

I want to. And I have to.

145
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:25.290
You'll get a nagging wife in your world, though.

Get married and see. It won't be the world you dreamed of.

153
00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:02.870
But even though I complain about how hard it is, it's not as exhausting as I make it sound.

154
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:05.540
It's fine even if it's exhausting.

155
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.800
I love Hari selfishly and shamelessly.

156
00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.560
So no matter what, I have to make her happy.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.670
What brings you here?

160
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:44.950
Well, the weather's nice. Let's go on a date.

161
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.420
I come here often.

162
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.240
I feel it every time I come, but I think it's uselessly expensive.

163
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.810
Why would you waste money uselessly?

164
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:03.300
Wow, the talk so smoothly went right into nagging.

165
00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:06.000
Taking care of me, giving me a place to sleep and eat,

166
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.820
washing my clothes, as well as babysitting my kid...

167
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.970
You should be complaining with, "Is this the best you can do?"

168
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:15.950
Why would I complain when you're treating me to an expensive meal?

169
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:20.330
Can you be taking a lunch break this long? Do you not have patients?

170
00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:24.640
Not sure if it's unlucky or lucky, but I'm getting more patients by the day.

171
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.590
I wanted to earn a lot and buy you something good.

172
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:32.880
I'll come by often. Let's go on a date again.

173
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.350
You're going to leave?

174
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.050
I should.

175
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:42.220
How can I see Hari now?

176
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.880
There's nothing I can do either.

177
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.810
Jaeyoung,

178
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.260
because you're too good to let go of,

179
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.150
I've acted terribly to you out of my own greed.

180
00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:02.110
No, Auntie. I... I was being greedy about Hari.

181
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.780
So when you and my mom were pregnant with us,

182
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.700
why didn't you just promise each other you'd have us get married to each other and become in-laws like everyone else?

183
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.020
I know. When everyone else was doing it, why didn't we?

184
00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.680
We should have arranged your marriage and married you two off at 20 years old.

185
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:19.750
And become suddenly fond of each other while disliking each other and arguing.

186
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.500
You came to like each other.

187
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.450
But because of the arranged marriage, you misinterpreted your true feelings and parted.

188
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.800
And then dramatically realizing each other's feelings and falling in love, ending in marriage.

189
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.910
It's that kind of an authentic and stale... story...

190
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.450
Now that we've said it out loud, it doesn't sound all that great.

191
00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.380
I know. It's not fun.

192
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:46.520
Have a lot.

193
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.130
Him taking a vitamin is that sad?

194
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:07.560
You know, too. He's taking it for treatment.

195
00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.460
He's doing it because he wants to. There's nothing to be sad about.

196
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.140
Are you cheering us on? I'm grateful.

197
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.970
Well, I was continuously rooting for you two.

198
00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:24.300
Now, Taerin, let's have you put on the outfit.

199
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.960
Mom.

200
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.080
You thought I was your mom? Where would your mom be?

201
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.310
Let's go look for your mom.

202
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:43.230
- Mom! 
 - I'm here!

203
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.270
Should we change? Do you want to pick it out, Taerin?

204
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.400
Let's do this one.

205
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.630
<i>Let's change. How pretty.</i>

206
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.220
<i>Should we try that on? Let's go.</i>

207
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.440
Oh, my ID.

208
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.800
Turn around.

209
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.200
Did you leave it at the studio? Seriously!

210
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.830
Hey, help me out.

211
00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.460
Shouldn't you buy a ring first?

212
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.100
I don't know her size. How do I give it to her in secret?

213
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:22.650
Wow. That's a Mission Impossible mission!

214
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.920
Even if you look at her finger, she'll know.

215
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.540
What about where to propose?

216
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.220
How about a cathedral?

217
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.590
It seems reverent and trustworthy.

218
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.170
And Hari has a bit of a Mother Teresa-like vibe, too.

219
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.230
I never would have known that's the impression she gave off.

220
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.830
Hey, why don't you just propose at the cathedral and do a wedding, too?

221
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.370
Oh, correct answer.

222
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.320
Ding! Wrong answer. That's not right.

223
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.430
Hey, wouldn't it be a problem if she's Buddist?

224
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.730
Now that I think about it, I don't know her religion.

225
00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.380
Where would be a good place?

226
00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.870
It's complicated.  A high-order equation.

Oh my! Oh my god!

229
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.390
He's going to propose!

230
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.470
Oh, how nice! I'm envious!

231
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.490
But doesn't it ruin it to know already?

232
00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.220
Since it's happened, you might as well get ready for it!

233
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.780
- Marry me. 
 - Would you marry me?

234
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.120
Getting married!

235
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.380
What happy news!

236
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:29.130
Let's go upstairs quickly!

Let's go!

238
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:35.020
When am I getting a proposal?

239

I guess I'm getting proposed to...

240
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.310
Amazing.

It won't take long.

It's almost done. You can get in first.

It could get dusty doing it in front of the office, so...

- What?

- Oh, there's⁠— 
 - No.

Why? Aren't we eating together?

I even made a reservation at a nice restaurant.

271
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:06.180
With a grand piano...

272
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:11.930
It must be a place that has no other customers today of all days, right?

273
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.400
How did you know? I reserved a nice restaurant.

274
00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.280
But... I don't think there was a grand piano.

275
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.290
I think there was an old upright piano, though.

276
00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:29.550
Please stop over there.

Sorry for going like this.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.880
I will take a good look at my own feelings, too,

280
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:49.810
so think about... whether this is your best, too.

281

Does she not like flowers? Or the restaurant?

282
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:10.410
What did I do wrong?

283
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.380
It's called cold feet.

284
00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.280
What's that?

285
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.950
It's a fear that you get before you marry.

286
00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.540
Hey, you know your life changes after you marry.

287
00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.500
Your heart is shouting that you need to run away.

288
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.850
Why run away?

289
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:29.790
I know I've given it up before, but I've been dreaming of it for 39 years.

290
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:35.920
Dreaming is what you do when you imagine the ideal person you want to have.

291
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.250
Reality is different.

292
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.790
You dreamed about a brilliant utopia and you crossed the Pacific Ocean

293
00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:47.150
and traveled through the desert to get there, but you found out it's an empty plain.

294
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:50.690
Because you might feel that, you're scared.

295
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:57.700
Well, I just dreamed of having an ordinary family.

296
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.760
WIth a husband cozily raising the kids.

297
00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.270
Living all lovey-dovey. Like others.

298
00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:11.620
Hey. It's the hardest to live like others.

299
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.960
Dreaming about having an ordinary and happy family,

300
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.860
isn't it because you've never had that?

301
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:24.940
You mean... my dad?

302
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:32.700
It could be so. But I don't only have bad memories about my dad.

303
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.770
Dad treated me well.

304
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:42.840
<i>He taught me how to ride a bike.</i>

305
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.190
<i>Dad taught me how to swim by going to the valley every summer, too.</i>

306
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.250
<i>And without mom knowing, he bought me junk food, too.</i>

307
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.760
But he left.

308
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:04.680
Yisang doesn't seem like he would leave since he's firm,

309
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:13.780
but why am I not able to take the nervousness into expectations but nervously run away?

310
00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:22.490
Hey. That— Aren't you just scared that he'll propose weirdly?

311
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:25.690
Right? It's probably that, right?

312
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.250
But... think about it at least once when you get cold feet.

313
00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:36.050
Because it's the last chance for you to be cool-headed in the hottest moment.

314
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:43.900
Thank you. You're so smart.

Yoon Jaeyoung.

317
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.030
Yoon Jaeyoung, are you upset that I didn't go look at houses with you?

318
00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:01.060
Should I go with you this weekend?

319
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:07.110
Jaeyoung. Friend. Release your anger.

320
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:11.800
I have a problem. You have to listen to it while eating intestines.

321
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.260
And I can listen to your problem, too.

322
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.390
Friend!

323
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.620
I understand, so stop it.

324
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.190
The friend that you want...

325
00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.770
I'm sorry but I can't be it right now.

326
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.960
If you thought about me, you should have told me when he asked you for money.

327
00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.390
Forget it. I won't tell you to vacate the store so don't cater to him.

328
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.980
Why did he ask for Hari's number? Don't you dare tell him!

329
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.920
He needs to see Hari?

331
00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.190
You're... interviewing the infertile couple later, right?

332
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:26.390
Yes. Jihye has the potential to miscarry, so only Sangmin is coming.

333
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.200
Is she doing badly?

334
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.130
I don't think there will be any problems. It has to be that way.

335
00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:37.690
Interviewing infertile couples... are you okay doing it?

336
00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:42.130
Why? Do you think it might only make me worry more?

337
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:48.440
I'm worried you'll pretend it's not hard when it is.

338
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.060
Hari... promise me.

339
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:06.380
Later, tell me if you are having a hard time or hurting.

340
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.240
That way I can hug you.

341
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.280
Why do you keep saying you're going to hug me?

342
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:14.030
Do you just want to hug me when you see me?

343
00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.920
Do you not have any thoughts of letting go of your baggage and living in my pocket?

344
00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.860
How do you keep getting more silly by the day?

345
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:26.230
Think about it seriously. Don't you want to be with each other every day?

346
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.170
- Hold on. 
 - Every day?

347
00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.240
You're going to do it here?

348
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:48.060
I don't think this is right. During the day and when there are people around.

349
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:51.810
Hold on. Wait.

350
00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.720
- This isn't it. 
 - Wait.

351
00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.390
No, then where do I tie my shoelace?

352
00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.270
Hari! Then I won't do it when there are people around!

353
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.520
Why are you on the streets doing that?!

354
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.640
On the streets... then where?

355
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.840
I don't know. This isn't it.

356
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:13.790
Is it embarrassing to tie my shoe on the streets?

357
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.860
She's picky.

358
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.730
What's wrong with me?

359
00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.380
Hari's finger size is 11.

360
00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.770
Director has no religion. Cathedral is a no-no.

361
00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.270
This... keep it in your pocket.

362
00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.130
Let's go.

363

365

- Mr. Eutteum. 
 - Yes?

366
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:36.540
Can you look at this file with me?

367
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.220
Okay.

368
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:12.820
- Oh, hello! 
 - Yeah.

369
00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:17.890
- I... Can I ask you something? 
 - Yeah, of course.

370
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:21.830
You're not perhaps... the grandson of the CEO, right?

371
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:28.420
Like learning the ropes of the business while hiding your real identity by working up from the bottom.

372
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.850
No. I told you last time.

373
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.750
What my parents do.

374
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.640
Your parents are great,

375
00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.580
but you could have lied to cover it up.

376
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.690
But well, if not, then never mind.

377
00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.120
Why are you like this?

378
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:58.140
I just know that I gave up my dream and made a huge decision.

379
00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.100
Anyway, we should eat dinner together later.

380
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.450
If it's because of the police station from the last time,

381
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.280
then it's okay. You don't have to buy me a meal.

382
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.970
I'll buy the meal so you buy the dessert!

383
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.720
Wait, wait.

384
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.130
- So you're going about like this. 
- Are you making reservations?

385
00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.770
Hold on. Okay.

386
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.940
Where did you reserve for?

I sent you a dessert.

389
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.830
It's okay for you to not buy me a meal!

390
00:32:56.830 --> 00:33:01.590
Work hard! Work hard!

391
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.570
What?

392
00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:18.400
What's your religion?

393
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.640
I'm Catholic.

394
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.420
So you're a church brother.

395
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:27.060
Like this, like this, like this?

396
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:33.380
I also want to attend, but it's hard to go in.

397
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.140
You just need to go to Sunday Mass.

398
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.830
No, I'm saying because I know nothing,

399
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.000
it's hard to go by myself.

400
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.550
Which church do you go to?

401
00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:51.220
Isn't evangelism result-driven, too? Try evangelizing me.

402
00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.150
It's not like that. Every district has its differences,

403
00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.100
so look into it and go to a cathedral near your home.

404
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.800
Work hard!

405
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:08.920
Oh, that loach-like punk. I just can't get a hold of him!

406
00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.800
If I grab here, he runs away this way. If I grab here, he runs away that way.

407
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.640
Seriously...

408
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:29.860
Doha, have fun.

409
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.260
Don't worry about me.

410
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.980
If Doha eats and then doesn't get a snack, she'll get irritated.

411
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.960
She likes to hold snacks in both hands while eating,

412
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.980
so make sure to let her hold one in each hand.

413
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:47.180
Okay.

414
00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:51.210
And Doha can't sleep without her doll.

415
00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.250
Leave it next to her when she sleeps.

416
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.660
Okay. I'm going.

417
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:58.430
And Doha...

418
00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.920
If I'm curious about something, I'll call you.

419
00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:20.440
Doha, who is this?

420
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.670
It's Dad. You can't forget about me.

421
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.070
I said I'll bring her back tomorrow.

422
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:47.050
If you were like this back then, it would have been nice.

423
00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:52.490
But even so... I took responsibility of Doha till the end.

424
00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:58.130
But you... placed more importance on your career.

425
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:14.310
Jihye is okay, right?

426
00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:17.370
She's just lying down and not moving.

427
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:18.710
She'll be okay.

428
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:20.120
I hope so.

429
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.230
If this doesn't work out, I would be hurt, but I think she would take it very hard.

430
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:30.240
She's been trying to get pregnant for years after giving up her job.

431
00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.580
Whenever it doesn't work out, she cries to the point of fainting.

432
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.410
Why complain about how hard it is for me?

433
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:42.180
I want a baby, but since my wife is so desperate to have one,

434
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.730
I can't tell her to let's give up,

435
00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:47.110
and watching her is so tough.

436
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:56.280
You must feel so sorry for her.

437
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.670
Right. There's nothing I can do but pray.

438
00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:03.190
I'm sure my prayers will be answered this time.

439
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:04.920
Of course.

440
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.880
Just in case... don't feel sorry.

441
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:27.140
You're pushing back the surgery even though you need it.

442
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:31.740
You're not holding it in when it hurts so much, are you?

443
00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:35.880
You were worried about that...

444
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:40.290
Your time is almost up.

445
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:44.130
If my results aren't good,

446
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.410
only think about yourself.

447
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.360
It's okay to do that.

448
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.560
Mom?

449
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.270
Why are you coming here instead of home?

450
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.190
What are you doing here?

451
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:27.820
I came out to get some air.

452
00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.990
I also want to get some air with you.

453
00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:39.330
Mom,

454
00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:46.290
if you didn't have me, how do you think you would have lived?

455
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.650
I probably would have somehow lived.

456
00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:56.510
Instead of working to keep you from having you go hungry, I would have worked so I wouldn't go hungry.

457
00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:02.370
If I'm lonely, I'd find something fun and spend time doing that.

458
00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.980
I would have lived without knowing what's good about having a child.

459
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.790
The happiness that a child gives you.

460
00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:13.370
When you're having a hard time and you can depend on your child, that's also happiness.

461
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.970
Are you anxious that you might not have a baby?

462
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.850
Kind of.

463
00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.050
If...

464
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:36.100
I marry,

465
00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.510
and I don't have a baby

466
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.650
and the husband leaves, how do I live?

467
00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:44.390
Why would you think that?

468
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.470
Because you think you'll live like me?

469
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:50.510
Oh, no. No!

470
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.160
I'm just thinking about the what-ifs.

471
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:57.720
Since life doesn't go the way you want.

472
00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:02.490
Think positive. Then things will turn out well.

473
00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.210
If there's nobody next to you,

474
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:09.620
I shouldn't die and stay beside you like this.

475
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:12.090
Yeah.

476
00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.810
Please. For sure.

477
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.220
Seriously.

478
00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:21.980
Seriously...

479
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:26.320
This is nice.

480
00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.860
This time, we'll recommend the diapers in the article for diaper rashes.

481
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.670
Like the last time, we just have to emphasize its air-permeability, right?

482
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.560
Yes.

483
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.220
But... for the renewal of the advertising contract,

484
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:45.520
how's the ambiance on your side?

485
00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.080
That's...

486
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.940
Is it difficult over there, too, these days?

487
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:56.530
We do paper ads and online ads together,

488
00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.080
so we can work on bringing down the unit cost.

489
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:05.390
Can you perhaps set up a meeting with the director in charge?

490
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:11.370
It's not that. Because of the rumors that "the baby" is being discontinued,

491
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:13.310
they don't want to renew their contract.

492
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.680
It's not really being discontinued, is it?

493
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.860
Who said that?

494
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.310
That's unbelievable.

495
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:27.910
<i>Restructuring?</i>

496
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.340
Sales keep falling.

497
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.400
We have to lower our spending.

498
00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.640
We are short-staffed as it is.

499
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:41.440
Because we can't use freelancers, I'm even writing the first drafts like any other reporter.

500
00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:46.810
Can't we make the employees into contracted workers or freelancers?

501
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.990
Then they'll probably quit.

502
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:51.900
Director Jang,

503
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.850
we have to get through this difficult time wisely

504
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.390
so that "the baby" will live on for decades more

505
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.350
as the only infant care magazine in the country. Don't you agree?

506
00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.570
Then...

507
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:07.620
I'll think about a way to increase sales and ads.

508
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.770
Let's talk about downsizing the labor force after that.

509
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.340
Bring me the restructuring proposal at the same time.

510
00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.950
- Oh. 
 - Director, we lost another advertiser.

511
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:31.090
They don't want to renew their contract?

512
00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:35.600
There's a rumor going around in this field that we're being discontinued,

513
00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:38.560
so they all seem to be hesitant about renewing.

514
00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:43.830
Let's quickly think of an event to show that we're still going on strong.

515
00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:46.700
The advertising department should come up with a marketing plan as well.

516
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.070
Okay. That's a given, of course.

517
00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:54.840
How about doing a cover model selection contest?

518
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.450
When we did it before, the feedback was good.

519
00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.970
It's not bad, but isn't there something new?

520
00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:04.960
How about doing a bazaar with all the infant care items we have stacked up in storage?

521
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.870
It's not that great. What about an online event?

522
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.150
And you have a way to do that?

523
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.900
You know the influencers on social media sites,

524
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.980
don't you young people have any ideas?

525
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:17.680
I like the idea of influencers.

526
00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.930
Gathering them and doing a collaboration on social media.

527
00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:25.160
It could be good.

528
00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.430
Are you working late from tonight?

529
00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:35.270
Then I should send late-night snacks.

530
00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.400
I also have an important project so I'm studying right now.

531
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.740
Because I'm someone who isn't negligent about learning.

532
00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.320
When you're done, call me if you need me to drive you home. Okay.

533
00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:04.270
Chief Han has sent us late-night snacks.

534
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:07.310
Oh, nice!

535
00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.960
Hey! Leave some for me. I'm going to eat after finishing this.

536
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:13.440
Let's just eat now.

537
00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.350
I think it'll help us work better.

538
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:20.620
Come quickly! They're going to eat everything!

539
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:34.190
Mom, I'll be home late since today is the deadline.

540
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:38.640
I'm not home either because I came to Donghae by night train to the alpine club.

541
00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:42.450
<i>We're ready for your exam.</i>

542
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.740
You're not at the hospital, right?

543
00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.470
What? No.

544
00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.780
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

545
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:52.180
Yes.

546
00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.830
It looks good.

547
00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:07.380
- Eat up. 
 - I'll eat well!

548
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.400
<i>We're ready for your exam.</i>

549
00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.910
Do you know where Mom went?

550
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:44.460
She said she's going to Gangneung with her alpine club.

551
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.280
- You didn't know? 
 - I did.

552
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.140
But... the alpine club doesn't really go away on weekdays.

553
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.950
Is Doha sleeping?

554
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.390
Doha's mom has her for a bit.

555
00:45:58.390 --> 00:46:00.410
That's good.

556
00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:18.820
What's this?

557
00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:42.940
Why did the lights go off?

558
00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.690
They said in order to do a safety check,

559
00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:47.220
they were going to shut if off. Did you not hear?

560
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.330
There was a notice stuck here.

561
00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.540
No, I didn't see it.

562
00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.940
Where are the candles?

563
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:08.500
Hey, the candles should be somewhere here.

564
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:41.600
I'm going to leave soon.

565
00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.160
Did you find a house?

566
00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.950
Yeah.

567
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:46.970
I see.

568
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:53.600
Have you ever had your heart flutter when looking at me?

569
00:47:55.830 --> 00:48:00.910
For a little bit during middle school when I hit puberty.

570
00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.160
For me, it was elementary school.

571
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:15.070
You were my first love.

572
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.540
Why are you talking about something from 30 years ago?

573
00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.290
When we went to the study rooms in high school together,

574
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.450
rumors about me liking you were spread around, remember?

575
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:38.010
They weren't joking though.

576
00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.880
Even if I knew that then, nothing would have changed between us.

577
00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.320
It probably would have.

578
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:52.080
Either I would be beside you like how I am now,

579
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.860
or we would have had a fallout and never seen each other again.

580
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:06.660
Because I was scared of that, I kept letting go of the opportunities to date you.

581
00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:13.150
What are you saying? We saw each other go through so many relationships.

582
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:22.160
That's true. Why am I thinking about the feelings that I had forgotten about now?

583
00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.600
Do you know what was fascinating when I started doing a parenting magazine?

584
00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.480
I've never fallen in my entire life.

585
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:45.840
My life went so smoothly that I was conceited about how I lived.

586
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:54.270
But when my life took a nosedive at nearly forty years old, I collapsed hopelessly.

587
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:00.500
There are a lot of good fathers out there.

588
00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.130
Like when you came to our house, I thought every father was a yahoo.

589
00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:11.960
I resented the world for giving me such a hardship late in life,

590
00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:13.940
but it wasn't a hardship.

591
00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:21.420
It was an opportunity to look back on what was wrong with my life and what I missed.

592
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:24.820
I knew it looking at you.

593
00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:28.600
That a father and a baby grow up together.

594
00:50:32.490 --> 00:50:36.130
You grew up into an amazing father.

595
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:47.040
It's my last chance to find what I lost.

596
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.170
I know it now.

597
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:06.320
The reason why life is giving me one last chance is because of you.

598
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:21.890
I'm going to go up.

599
00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.030
Hari,

600
00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:34.460
I like you a lot.

601
00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:48.150
Even if it's like this, if I don't confess to you,

602
00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:53.350
I don't think I'll be able to end it.

603
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.030
You shouldn't have done it.

604
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.450
You shouldn't have told me.

605
00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:13.860
How can I lose you again?

606
00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:26.210
Like an adolescent boy, once I'm done being excited, hurt, and being sick like this,

607
00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:29.500
I'll mature a little more. Right?

Hari, is something going on with your mom?

She didn't come to the leather workshop.

She probably hasn't come back from Donghae yet.

633
00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:44.860
Ah, okay.

634
00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:07.520
Yeah, Aunt? Is my mom hurting somewhere?

635
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.160
Her stomach cancer hasn't returned, has it?

636
00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:14.770
Tell me. Don't make me the only one who doesn't know.

637
00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.190
You're saying I should keep working again without knowing that Mom is sick?

638
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:20.660
Then I'll be very upset.

639
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.360
It knots me up.

640
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:31.180
Why is Mom there?

641
00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:44.870
<i> [Aunt Okran] </i>

642
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.510
Yes, Auntie?

643
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.690
Jaeyoung, I'm at the hospital right now.

644
00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:58.480
I think Hari will cry and raise a fuss when she comes, so come and take her home.

645
00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.500
Yeah, I'm asking you for a favor. Okay.

646
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.110
<i> [Jang * Seop] </i>

647
00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:47.310
You came?

648
00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:49.490
What are you doing here, Mom?

649
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.810
Are you Hari?

650
00:56:55.810 --> 00:57:00.870
You grew up prettily. I heard you turned 39 this year.

651
00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.040
Hari, give me that and go. It's not something you should worry about.

652
00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.700
Is this something you need to concern yourself with?

653
00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:27.830
He's a stranger.

654
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:30.650
Why are you here taking care of him?

655
00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.010
He's in the last stage of liver cancer.

656
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:35.660
They say he'll be okay with surgery, so I'm going to leave once the surgery's done.

657
00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.690
Exactly why would you be present for that?

658
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:47.910
If you're concerned, get him a caregiver.

659
00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:53.360
After all he's done to you, why would you suffer again?

660
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.240
I'll take care of it myself. You go and do your own work.

661
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.940
You also resent him!

662
00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:01.450
If he didn't leave like that,

663
00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:07.540
you wouldn't have had to go work at 4:00 a.m. and come back with swollen hands and feet at 10:00 p.m.!

664
00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:11.100
I feel so sorry for you from that time that it hurts me to this day!

665
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.180
Why are you keeping all that in your heart?

666
00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.910
I was worried you'd be like this, so I didn't want you to see him. Why are you here?

667
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:19.570
I'm not doing this because I care for him, so ignore this and go to work.

668
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.040
No, I don't like you being here like this. Let's go home.

669
00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.950
I'm doing this for a reason!

670
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:26.950
It upsets me!

671
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:33.740
Do you think you'll feel at ease after hearing that your homeless dad passed away at a hospital from a sickness?

672
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.170
I'm not doing this for him, I'm doing it for me so that you don't end up getting upset.

673
00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:40.380
Because it's like that, you don't have to make a mess!

674
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:43.210
Why do you think I'm this upset?

675
00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:46.600
I don't care if someone who wasn't around until now dies or not.

676
00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.990
He never appeared once since he left.

677
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:53.370
Whether he's hurt or not, I don't even hate him anymore.

678
00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.100
Why do I have to feel hurt?

679
00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:03.660
I'm sorry.

680
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:08.550
For making that kind of person be your father.

681
00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.160
Why are you sorry!?

682
00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.820
I'm okay, so just leave.
