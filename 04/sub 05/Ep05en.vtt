Love Is All

Episode 05
Miaomiaosheng's Bookstore is in crisis
Tang Tianyuan remembers the past story

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.720
Magistrate Tang, please come in.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.160
Magistrate Tang.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.440
What brings you here? Please have a seat.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.630
Zhuang. Serve tea here.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.000
Coming.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.110
Still 2 tael per cup?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.800
How dare I do that.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.880
Don't be kidding me.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.920
Magistrate Tang. Enjoy.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.240
Why I didn't see your sister today?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.360
In these days, my sis

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.830
has worked hard on writing.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.720
She said she needed to transcribe

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.860
official documents until midnight. She's so tired,

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.080
So she went to the pharmacy to get some medicine.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.550
Then I'll go.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.360
By the way,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.520
why does your sister like Tang Tianyuan?

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.270
Our family had been in trouble before,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.940
and Tang Tianyuan used to help us at that time.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.830
Where do you come from?

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.880
Ji Nan.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.030
Tang Tianyuan lives in the capital.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.770
Are you sure he's the one who helped you?

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.440
Our mom was died in fire years ago.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.520
And our dad became the murder.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.670
My sister was 8 years old, and she had no one to rely on.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.550
The family members wished that

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.110
our dad got into prison

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.030
so that they could share our family's property.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.750
At that time,

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.110
Tang Tianyuan passed by Jinan. He found out the truth

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.880
and saved our father.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.830
What he did to us.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.270
My sis has remembered it till now.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.880
But at that time, Tang Tianyuan...

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.740
Only 10 years old.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.240
So for my sis, Tang Tianyuan

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.110
is not only the one saved our family but also hope.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.750
Our family can be survived because of Tang Tianyuan.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.390
And he's also the one who brings courage to my sis.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.910
Leave home

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.270
and chase for her dream.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.110
There's no doubt that Tang Tianyuan is an important person

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.240
of her life.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.750
And her love for him

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.000
will never be changed either.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.550
I see. Since adviser is not here today,

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.320
I'll leave now.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.480
Mr. Tang.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.670
Don't expect crying can help you

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.270
solve the problem because you're a girl.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.760
You have to live your own life.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360
There's no difference between boys and girls.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.880
Officer Zheng. Have you felt that

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.440
there's something wrong with Magistrate Tang?

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.640
He's always picking on me.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.130
He's either bullied me or fined me every day.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.510
I'm here for the money.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.110
Adviser, what do you think of him?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.920
How about being a husband?

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.760
Maybe the girl digged his family's

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.670
grave in previous life.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:35.920
She must have done something very wicked,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.790
so she has to spend her life with him now.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.270
Don't be so confident.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.950
Maybe you're the one.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.350
Although his personality is awful,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.070
he's quite clever.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.360
If he can be more gentle and soft,

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.880
maybe he can be a good official.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.670
You're here, my lord.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.920
You think the country is safe and sound

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.000
so there's nothing you can do but wait for death here?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.440
Alright, alright. I'll go patrol.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.480
Wait! My nails has done yet.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.950
Ask him to help you.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.920
I was helping you to investigate the case

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.270
and found the truth. Why you fine me?

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.440
Also the interest!

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.270
Interest?

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:39.670
Your salary should be paid by the end of the month.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.390
I've already given you the money today.

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.170
So you should be the one who paid the interest.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.320
But...

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.160
There's no "but".

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.230
If you do something wrong, you should be punished.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.840
There's a lot of people in the office,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.710
how can they trust me if I don't fine you.

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.720
After this case closed,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.920
I'll definitely ask Miaomiaosheng

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.480
to write bad words of you in the novel

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.040
and scold you.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.160
Mr. Miao is still in the mood to travel outside?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.600
Help me to remove it.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.610
Well, your brother doesn't look so much like you.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.670
We're not biological brother and sister.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:35.940
I picked him up from the road.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.790
What? You look down on us?

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.270
No, I'm not.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.320
Someone said that Qi Hui's death

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.640
is related to Miaomiaosheng's novel.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.950
This is clearly set him up.

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.510
It is obvious that

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.180
there's someone behind to spread the rumor.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:55.070
Will it be landlord Qi?

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.550
Keep blowing.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.830
Landlord Qi wanted to bring Qi Hui's body back

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.880
to do a big funeral for her, but I refused.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.040
Perhaps he's not happy with it

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.230
and he wants me to taste it as well.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.000
So he wanna set me up

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.560
by using the thing of Miaomiaosheng's novel.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.230
But I can understand him.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.230
He wants her daughter to rest in peace.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:21.040
We can't just let it go.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.600
How dare he to look for trouble with my staff.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:25.060
I won't forgive him.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.000
Is it good?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.200
It looks so ugly.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.440
Here.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.760
I'm gonna put it...

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.280
Assistant Zhou, what do you think?

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.590
I think

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.110
we're the judge of the case.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.110
We shouldn't

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.300
jump to our own conclusions.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.830
Otherwise, we'll easier to be misled.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.960
We should analyze comprehensively from all aspects.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.150
Tell us about your analysis.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.710
Wait.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.670
Your honor is the judge here.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.110
But if I don't say it,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.670
I would feel that

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:16.760
I didn't do my job.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.550
Say it.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:21.320
It's what you asked for.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.400
Say it.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.000
I think both Qi and Sun families

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.420
are the rich families in Tongling.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.970
Miss Qi always behaved appropriate.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.640
Here. Here.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.200
And she's not that kind of flirtatious girl.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.790
So the childhood love story

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.400
between Qi Hui and him

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.760
is definitely faked.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.470
I think

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.550
there's another possibility.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.840
Just say it.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.230
I think Qi Hui doesn't seem to be running away from marriage.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:46.730
but more likely to elope with someone.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.840
You see that her clothes are

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.280
as similar as Wei Zitong.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.000
She must be planned to go with Wei Zitong.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.150
But I have no idea

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.240
why she got killed after that.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.110
Officer Zheng. What do you think?

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.360
Just tell me who you wanna arrest.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:09:59.720
I don't wanna use my brain.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.520
Something happened outside, my lord.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.400
Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.440
Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.960
Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.760
Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:13.320
Arrest Miaomiaosheng! Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.030
Arrest Miaomiaosheng!

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.080
Who leaked the details of Qi Hui's case?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.110
I've told them not to tell anyone.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:22.150
We've already know what happened to Miss Qi.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.670
If it's not Miaomiaosheng's novel

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:25.910
which let her be bewitched,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.350
how will she elope with man in midnight!

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:29.470
That's right!

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.880
Miaomiaosheng wanna control people's lives through his novel.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.080
And the content of his novel is delivered evil ideas.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.400
Your honor. Please shut down

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.880
Gutang Bookstore.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.320
Shut down Gutang Bookstore!

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.200
Shut down Gutang Bookstore!

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.740
Who said a woman's life can only take care of her husband and children.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.200
Can't she run her own business,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.590
and do what she want?

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.840
On the contrary, look at yourself.

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:52.550
Such stubborn and stupid.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.960
The adviser is worked in Gutang Bookstore.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.710
She must know where's Miaomiaosheng.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.110
Get her!

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:00.080
Yes! Get her! Get her!

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.960
Get me? Why?

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760
Get her! Get her!

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.350
Get her! Get her!

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:06.150
Hide behind me.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:13.640
Get her! Get her!

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.400
Guys, I know what you mean.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.280
Qi Hui did read Miaomiaosheng's novel before.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.910
But if you keep doing like this,

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:22.960
we have to stop investigation

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.070
and catch Miaomiaosheng first.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.910
It may let the murderer run away instead.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.470
Also, I even suspect that

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:32.000
the murderer is right here among you.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.670
How is it possible.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:34.550
I don't believe it.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:36.670
Go home now. Go.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.150
Don't spread the rumor. Go home.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.000
We'll wait.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.550
Okay. We'll wait.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.440
What rumor.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440
Let's wait at home.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:41.880
Go. Go.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.640
We want the truth.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.230
Go. Go. Go.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.520
My bookstore!

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.880
Hand over him! He must pay for it!

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:52.320
Yes!

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.520
Hand over him! Hand over him!

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.150
Hand over Miaomiaosheng!

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.150
Hand over him! That's him!

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.880
Qingchen.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.710
Are you okay?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.080
It's all my fault.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.880
You said we'd better shut down.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.840
But I didn't agree with it.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.080
It's okay, sis. They just teared the novel,

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.540
and don't allow us to sell it.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:14.440
Don't be worried.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.270
The rumor will be broken.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.910
And the truth will be found out.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.520
That is true.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.630
But if Qi Hui didn't read my novel,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.550
will she not do elopement,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.280
and not be killed?

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.000
Sis, why you also think it in that way?

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.710
Will it be better for Qi Hui to

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:34.350
marry with someone she doesn't love,

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.230
stuck in the family

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.030
for years,

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.640
and die in despair?

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:38.320
I don't know.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.640
I'm the one who'll choose freedom,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.840
but no one will make as same choice as me.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.590
If we can choose

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:45.930
between happiness and life,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.400
maybe for Qi Hui,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.960
she'll choose to live instead of happiness.

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.000
Sis.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.880
All happiness is real.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.660
And all the suffering are existed as well.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.320
People who chase for happiness

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.670
will never yield to fate.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.280
Alright, sis. Don't think too much.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.740
The most important thing now

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.000
is to find the murderer,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.710
and don't make you hurt by the rumor.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:09.760
Hand over him!

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.790
Hand over him!

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.550
Wei Zitong looks so weak.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.710
He doesn't look like a murderer.

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.470
Love makes people do wrong.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.400
If he stays away with girls

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.000
and focuses on studying as same as me,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.080
he'll be successful in a few more years.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.760
He won't ruin his future because of this.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.350
Why I feel that you sounds like...

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.960
jealous on him?

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:37.710
My lord, that's Wei Zitong's house.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:43.230
You two go visit neighbors around.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.030
See how people think of him.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:47.200
What about you?

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:48.640
I'll go check his house.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.840
My lord.

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.080
Follow me.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.590
Anybody there?

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.470
I didn't see you for 3 days and I miss you so much.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:51.590
Is this really the love letter

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:52.910
which Wei Zitong wrote to Qi Hui?

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.960
So it's not unrequited love

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.710
between Wei Zitong and Qi Hui.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.250
What he said is true.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.440
But if it is true,

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.840
the motivation of him to kill her

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840
is more obvious now.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.470
I can't read these anymore.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.030
I haven't eaten all the way.

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:12.280
I'm starved.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.350
What about

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:15.640
let's go get something delicious?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.910
Okay.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.200
Cong Shun. Back to the county office.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.760
Got it, my lord.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.670
Hi everyone,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.710
don't just pass by.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.320
Please have a taste.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.320
Why do you burn it?

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.280
Miaomiaosheng's novels

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.640
are on sales everywhere.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.000
It's even cheaper than the firewood.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.670
It's good to burn it as firewood.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.470
Don't burn it.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:48.960
These are novels written with heart.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.980
I have a lot of firewood in my house and I'll get it for you.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.550
I am cooking.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:53.350
If you really want it,

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:54.840
Find cripple Xu in the western side,

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.200
and tell him that I introduce you there.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.600
He'll give you a special discount.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:58.440
Sir.

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.440
I'll take them all.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.520
What are you doing?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.790
The table is not stable enough,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.380
so I'll put them under it.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.200
Stop it. It's already broken.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.670
Don't you hate Miaomiaosheng's novels?

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.600
Why you cost so much to buy it?

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.470
The sage said that we need to respect paper and words.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.960
You must be very happy now.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.440
Miaomiaosheng's fame is ruined.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.230
And no one will read her novels anymore.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:41.710
No one will make up story by your name.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:44.470
If it can really be like this, it is a good thing.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.550
If you hate Miaomiaosheng that much,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.200
why you bought this? To insult her?

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.640
I'm not that kind of narrow person.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.670
I'm thinking if she failed this time,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.030
and wanna suicide,

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.660
these will be the last novels of her.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.350
It's 5 taels before.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.910
And later, it will be 500 taels.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.350
This is called commercial opportunity.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.710
You must be suffered a lot as you're so mean.

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.040
Are you mad?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.800
Mr. Miao?

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.589
What...Mr. Miao?

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:19.709
He's traveling outside.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:20.880
How do I know whether he's mad.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:23.520
Travel in this night market?

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.560
You...

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.190
When did you know that?

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.040
When you tried to save those novels.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.350
The way you look like.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.520
Anyone could see that.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:42.190
This world

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:43.880
is not allowed girls work outside.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.310
So I have to do it in this way.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.560
What a nice excuse.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.680
All of your stories talk about love

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.520
between men and women.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.880
If girls who are never experienced that,

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.230
after reading your books,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.830
they are easily to do things in wrong way.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:57.920
Just like Qi Hui.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.880
It's not fair to blame Miaomiaosheng

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.890
for Qi Hui's death.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.800
Don't you know how many girls get back their confidence

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.040
and realize the most important thing of their lives

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.400
after reading Miaomiaosheng's books?

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.190
Only true feelings can make you realize your value.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.190
All you do is making stuffs up,

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.400
it's all just imagination.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.640
Tell me,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800
have you ever been in love?

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:19.400
Do you know what love is like?

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.950
Do you know what kind of person Tang Tianyuan is

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:22.560
in real life?

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.710
You don't know that.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.040
How can you make up what he thinks?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.070
I know it's wrong.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:32.760
I shouldn't have written his story using your name.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.920
But I didn't know you by then.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:36.920
I didn't mean to do it.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:39.040
What about now?

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:44.110
Now I know, your lordship is so wise and courageous,

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.680
I will write down all your virtues in the book.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.950
Adviser Tan, you are drying me out.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.830
My lord, you're affluent. You cant' be dried out.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.470
All right.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.430
We've made it clear.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.680
Just let me off this time.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:08.710
Don't forget what you owe me.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.040
Why don't I remember I owe you something?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.400
You owe me a clarifying of my innocence.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.920
If only you were Tang Tianyuan.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.430
Tang Tianyuan is so smart,

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.760
he will solve the case fast,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.680
and prove my innocence.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.160
Why do you trust him so much?

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.070
He's my backbone in my heart.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.190
He gave me the courage to be independent.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.920
He has done such a big mistake?

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.350
When my mother died in the fire,

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.470
and my father was framed as the murderer,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.800
it's he who

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.950
overturned the false accusations from those people.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400
At that time, Tang Tianyuan

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.640
brought two little piggies,

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.430
one living, one dead,

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:46.350
he threw them into the fire at the same time.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.800
There was ash in the mouth of the living pig,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.680
and the dead one had no.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.470
This proved that

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:54.470
Mrs. Tan died before the fire

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.400
and the autopsy also showed that she died of asthma.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.110
You also heard about it?

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:03.400
Tang Tianyuan is really famous.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.680
He just happened to encounter your case.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.280
You are exaggerating.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.830
But he was only ten at that time.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.640
What does it have to do with age.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.110
He didn't come to you specially.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.160
But he did keep me from losing both my parents,

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.310
and he talked to me,

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.190
it is his words that get me through

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.310
the hard time.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:24.310
What did he say?

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.470
That's between Tang Tianyuan and me.

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:27.190
None of your business.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.350
Go your own way.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.560
There is no different between boys and girls.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.190
So beautiful.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.760
Love letters to Qi Hui?

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.040
It's true that there is always someone better than you.

00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:43.830
I'm going to use all these sweet words

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:45.110
in my novels.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.040
It will be another best-selling.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:49.920
Adviser.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.190
I didn't do anything.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.640
And I didn't ask.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.350
I told you to keep a record, how's it going?

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.430
I'm sorting it out.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.350
I'll show you after finishing.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.710
Is it under this book? Let me have a look.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:13.190
My lord!

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.680
What's up?

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.680
Is this your fan?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.640
You can have it.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.680
Really?

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:25.400
Thank you, my lord.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.160
Let me have a look.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.070
My lord!

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.680
My Lord, it's blood.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.760
Come with me.

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.190
Will it work, Muskmelon?

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.110
Why not?

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.040
I got inspired when reading Miaomiaosheng's novel

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.160
yesterday.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.520
You read his novel, too?

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.350
It's learning from strong points. Understand?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.590
So you're gonna make a heart for his lordship

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:58.000
as in the novel?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.470
Yes, but I'll replace the bun

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.430
with muskmelon.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.800
And put my loving meatball in it.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.950
Then get it steamed.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.160
A steamed heart means true heart.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.000
It represent the true heart of Muskmelon.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.160
Don't you think it's meaningful?

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.430
It's a good idea.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.640
But in this world

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.470
if a true heart

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:25.310
can be traded for another true heart.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.110
There won't be so many sad ending couples

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:29.470
and love-hate entanglements.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:32.070
Eat it. You talked too much.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.800
This is Lingyin Tiger Balm.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.950
Once and for all.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:55.000
My lord,

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:57.880
I have a question.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:59.920
I don't know if I should ask

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.760
or not.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.710
You should not.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.310
Do all men like this kind of

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:12.190
body contact?

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:16.640
Can I do it myself?

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.880
Give it to me.

00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:28.920
When a woman's hand

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.190
touches your face,

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:30.830
what does it feel like?

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.680
I don't feel much.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.160
Kind of... creepy.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.430
You're getting goose bumps

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.880
and shivering all over, right?

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:45.400
I know.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.230
Master Miao,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.350
you can't just experiment on me

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.800
without any scruple

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.400
because I found out your identity.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:21.710
My lord, you don't know about it.

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.710
It's said in the books that

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.400
when two people stay together,

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.800
the first time they touch each other

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:28.350
is the time their hearts flip-flop.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.230
Then they will feel

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.070
an electrical current in their bodies.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.830
I did that because of you.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:36.430
You said my stories are not realistic enough.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.590
That's why I need to experience life

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.590
and try more things.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.880
So that my stories will be more alive and real.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.800
You haven't been idle for a moment.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:49.520
That's because of you.

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.950
You pay me too little.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:56.400
Look how romantic Wei Zitong is.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.040
I'll follow you to the end of the Earth,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.950
see you by the river today at 9 pm.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:01.470
This...

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.040
This is the letter about elopement from Wei Zitong to Qi Hui.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:06.760
He's been lying all the time?

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.070
But...

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:09.590
His feelings are so real.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.230
It's just a little poem,

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:23.830
and you've already fallen for it?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.040
You man don't understand

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.640
the beauty of love, I know it.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.800
But Qi Hui understood.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.040
It's right because of this

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.520
that she tried to run away and ended getting murdered.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.190
Talking to you is a waste of time.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:49.950
But there's one thing I don't understand,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.520
why did Wei Zitong refuse to admit that

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.710
he eloped with Qi Hui?

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:56.640
We don't know if he told the truth.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.040
But I'm sure that

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.430
someone has lied.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.040
Yuhuan.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.800
Hold court trial.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:19.000
Yuhuan, Yuhuan.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.710
Adviser Tan, I forgot to mention.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.640
If someone colludes with others

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.680
to murder his master,

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680
what crime will he be convicted of?

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.590
For murdering he be sentenced with death penalty.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.430
Considering who he murders is his master,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.550
his body will be teared limb from limb by five horses,

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:36.760
and his family will suffer collective punishment.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.760
Yuhuan, it's not only you who will die.

00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:43.950
Your parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles all have to die.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.830
Just speak the truth.

00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:48.310
Your Honor, I didn't kill my lady.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.190
I'm wronged.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.520
Then why do you gave false testimony?

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.190
My lady and her cousin Wei Zitong

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.520
grew up together,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.640
it's hard for them to break up.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.830
They had been sending each other letters.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:04.000
I'm their messenger.

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:06.760
Why did you say that your lady

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.710
was not familiar with Wei Zitong?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.320
That's because...

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.800
Landlord Qi is afraid that the thing

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.040
will ruin my lady's reputation.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.470
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.000
Please believe me, Your Honor.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.680
Why did this box of letters

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.400
appear at Wei Zitong's place?

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:28.110
My lady treasured every letter between she and Wei Zitong

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.350
and she put all of them

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.760
into that box.

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:33.680
The day my lady went missing,

00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:35.470
that box also disappeared.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.920
My Lord, do you really think

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:44.070
that Wei Zitong is the murderer?

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.560
Why do you ask about this?

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:49.470
Although all the evidences show that it's him.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:52.190
But I still think his process of committing crime

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.760
is too perfect.

00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:55.160
It's like a conspiracy.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.920
What you said just now

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.190
makes you like a real adviser.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:02.710
I am an adviser.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:09.280
What is this?

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.280
You can eat whatever you want in the kitchen.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.350
Muskmelon?

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:21.110
There's a heart.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:26.940
This dish is quite like another dish in my novels.

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.070
You also write recipe?

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.760
Tell me about it.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:32.920
Foods can also transfer feelings.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.680
Here.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.350
I will gain weight.

00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:38.350
Take a bite.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:39.950
If you don't eat, I will.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.070
It's so delicious.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:46.160
Do you want to try?

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:47.800
I don't.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.760
Take a bite.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.640
I said no.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.280
Take a bite.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.520
It's so delicious.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.710
You eat it up.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.590
Oh, I see.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.110
My lord.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:13.800
My lord.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.000
I'm so tired.

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.310
Look at these two pieces of paper,

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.070
this one is from Siya paper shop,

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.800
it was used for the letter about elopement.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.590
And this was generally used for other letters.

00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.760
I ran a dozen of stores and finally found them.

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:30.310
The boss said,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.110
Wei Zitong only buys paper at his store,

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.830
because he is the only one who would allow him on credit.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:34.600
He couldn't afford

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:37.340
the letter used for letter about elopement.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.640
There must be something wrong.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.470
Didn't you come to our County Office to be the adviser

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:43.160
only for money?

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.460
Why are you so interested in this Wei Zitong now?

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.400
It's serious.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.190
Qi Hui was murdered, and the murderer remains unknown.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:54.000
I just want to find the murderer

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000
and let her rest in peace.

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.190
I thought you would understand me.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.160
I know what you mean.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.160
But you're hiding something from me.

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.680
Just tell me the truth.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.520
People keep saying that Qi Hui's death

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.760
is related to Miaomiaosheng's novels.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:12.920
I just want to prove that

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.520
I'm innocent, and so is Gutang Bookstore.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.710
See? Still for personal reasons.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:22.230
But that's a good thing.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.350
If you are wronged

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:26.830
and you still don't care about it,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.070
then you won't feel

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:30.430
the sufferings of the victims and their families.

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.560
Since you can do empathizing

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.350
and know the importance of "innocence and justice",

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.880
you will be more attentive in handling cases.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.880
You're using me?

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.160
Anything else?

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.880
Although the calligraphy on the two letters look very similar.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:53.230
But there's still a difference.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.000
Paper with better quality

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.590
can bear more ink.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.640
Wei Zitong can only afford this kind of paper,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.710
so when he dips in ink

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:01.920
he dips as less as possible.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:03.710
But look at this one,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.920
It's still so clear after being soaked in water.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.070
And the strokes look very powerful.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.880
So Wei Zitong certainly didn't write

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.680
the elopement letter.

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.800
He must have been framed.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.520
Can you tell Officer Zheng

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.920
to stop use torture on him?

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.470
Putting him in jail

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:21.880
is for the convenience of examining the wounds.

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.800
And we didn't find any wound

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:24.160
on his body.

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.310
But there's shed skin in Qi Hui's fingernails.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.680
She's been dead for days.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.520
If we can't find the murderer,

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:34.520
his wound is about to heal.

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.830
So now we have to go somewhere.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.880
Please.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.190
Don't do that.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.280
Watch your hands.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.680
OK, I'll wait for you.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:53.110
Come again next time.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.310
Come again.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:58.160
Mister.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.800
It's terrible.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.830
Don't touch me.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.630
Where's adviser Tan?

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.470
She's not here yet?

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.760
She's already enjoying.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.760
She's enjoying?

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.800
Then we can't fall behind.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.520
Let's go, go, go, go.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:17.870
I...

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:18.630
Have a good time.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.870
Here.

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.390
You are so handsome.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:33.150
You're good, too.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.080
Mr. Sun, you are here.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.600
Where is Liu Hong?

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.469
A new guest came today,

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:50.519
Liu Hong is called away.

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.280
How about I get you Caixia?

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.670
Caixia.

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:53.150
No need.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:58.360
Let me tell you, stop this thing.

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.280
I don't want Caixia, or Zhaoxia, Wanxia.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.150
I don't care who Liu Hong is with,

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:08.560
now let her come to see me right away.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.470
OK, Mr. Sun, go to the room first.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.040
Why you keep touching me?

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.360
Did you fall for me?

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.080
You've seen all my mind.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.560
Get away.

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.360
Why are you following me? Go find her.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:26.520
Yes.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:27.280
Caixia!

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.150
I will accompany you tonight, master.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.080
What accompany?

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:38.470
I don't care who she's with,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:41.470
let him die. Hear me?

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.190
Now let Liu Hong come to see me. Get out.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.950
It's OK. Just go.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.600
Yes.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.080
Miss Liu Hong,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.000
do me a favor.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:57.000
Thank you, master.

00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:04.000
Coming. You're so moody today.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.080
My little beauty, you're finally here.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:06.670
Come here.

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.230
Give me a kiss.

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.840
Let me.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.470
Come on, come on.

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:13.080
Easy.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.230
It hurts me.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:16.710
Faster.

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.760
Don't hurry.

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:28.630
That Sun Bufan

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:29.670
wouldn't have imagined that

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:31.910
he has been tricked by a prostitute.

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.040
Of course.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.360
Why do you suspect Sun Bufan?

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:37.800
Qi Hui was familiar with two men,

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:39.280
she fought hard before she died,

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.430
she must have left a wound on the murderer's body.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800
The wound is our clue

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.280
to find the murderer.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.430
Now we can finally prove that

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:47.630
who is the real murderer.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.280
Where is he going?

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:56.600
Judging by that speed,

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.040
he must have seen his sweetheart.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:13.290
