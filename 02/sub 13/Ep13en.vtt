4
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.170
The owner changed?

5
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.710
<i>Episode 13</i> 
 -Yes. I think the new owner is trying to demolish it.

6
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.810
Wait, they're demolishing it without letting the tenant know?

7
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.250
It hasn't even been a month since I moved here.

8
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.470
I know. But this new owner isn't picking up their phone.

9
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.210
Then what do we do?

10
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.360
Wait a little bit.

11
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.230
They wouldn't demolish right away.

12
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.860
I sent you my address by text. Can you confirm the certified copy of register?

13
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.020
Hold on. Didn't you check it when you moved?

14
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.490
- Of course, I did. 
 - Then why are you checking again?

15

Let's see.

17
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.570
- Huh? 
 - What?

18
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.560
You signed with this woman?

19
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.860
Who is it?

20
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.350
The owner is Jang Seo Kyeong.

Thanks.

23
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.530
They say the CEO took Secretary Kim on her Guam trip.

24
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.370
I find it odd because it's not even a business trip.

25
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.970
When is she coming back?

26
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.760
When I asked the secretary's office, they said she didn't buy a return ticket.

27
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.280
<i>This is me.</i>

31
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.220
She was determined in leaving.

32
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.420
Left?

33
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.760
I asked the company and they said she's on a business trip overseas that Jang Seo Kyeong.

34
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.670
<i>You live by your style.</i>

- Seonbae Jae Hyeon... 
 - He can't know.

37
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.390
Exactly. Since Seonbae Jae Hyeon shouldn't know,

38
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.580
I called an almost professional.

39
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.620
Hey!

40
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.860
Hurry, sir!

41
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.450
I'm not someone who goes to rugged places like this, nevermind walking.

42
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.150
It would be much easier if you didn't speak.

43
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.450
Why... why are you doing this to me?

44
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.460
You've arrived, Seonbae?

45
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.620
I think you guys called the wrong person. I'm a divorce attorney.

46
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.640
Call me when you get a divorce. I'm off.

47
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.570
We'll make sure to call you when we get a divorce, too. But for now, let's go in.

48
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.560
Wait, wait.

49
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.850
Grandpa.

50
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.280
Oh, come in, come in.

51
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.570
Why, do you need money?

52
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.950
Can't you plead with them, Grandpa?

53
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.020
About what?

54
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.640
Mom and Dad's divorce.

55
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.020
Why should I do that?

56
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.440
It's embarrassing if they get divorced.

57
00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.330
Embarrassing?

58
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.100
It is embarrassing.

59
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.680
Let me tell you everything, since you're old enough to understand now.

60
00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.360
This divorce is not your mom wanting it, but what your dad wants.

61
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.950
It's not just a divorce. It's because he has a woman he likes outside of this family.

62
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.840
Even if this is a corrupt world, that's the kind of bastard your dad is.

63
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.110
On top of that, the company that started with your grandfather's grandfather, he's doing all kinds of things to take

64
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.530
he's doing all kinds of things to take it for himself!

65
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.810
I took a guy who walked in with only his underwear and made him human.

66
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.330
Instead of laying prostate for the rest of his life, he  dared plunge a knife into my back.

67
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.610
Stop the divorce? Why stop it? Why?

68
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.730
Hey, we should change your name to Jang Joon Seo while we're at it.

69
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:51.380
Why? You don't want to? Then you can follow out with your dad.

70
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.890
So there's no point in even asking a high-end attorney like me about this situation.

71
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.610
It's 100%. 100% purely illegal. Ouch, that's hot.

72
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.330
Jae Hyeon's wife goes with the outlook "Illegal or not, I'll compensate for everything, so bite down hard

73
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.910
because I'm going to punch you in your grill."

74
00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.340
Isn't there some more professional expression than stuff like 'grill'?

75
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.160
Yeah, uh, right.

76
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.860
If you want to tell a tenant to leave, you can file something called an eviction suit,

77
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.070
but it's been less than a month since she moved in.

78
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.480
It's not like you're late on rent or did anything illegal,

79
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.200
so it isn't easy either. And it would take her a really long time.

80
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.930
Yeah, that kind of stuff!

81
00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.800
Ji Soo. There's an expression you learn as soon as you go to law school.

82
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:53.540
"Those who sleep on their rights cannot be protected."

83
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:03.040
<i>You cannot be connected so you will be directed to the voicemail.</i>

84

Joon Seo.

85
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.360
Do you have something to say?

86
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:30.080
No. I'm just bored. Mom isn't around, either.

87
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.100
You want to do something together?

88
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.330
No...

89
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.480
Do you want to sleep here?

90
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.420
I don't know.

91
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.740
Wow, I get to sleep with my son for the first time in a while.

92
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:51.050
We used to sleep together and bathe together in the past.

93
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.280
What about it...

94

 <i>[Department Store Collapses in Seoul]</i>

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.610
You've really troubled yourselves coming here.

99
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.170
But what you're trying to do is completely illegal.

100
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.670
If you start the illegal demolition

101
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:35.070
you'll be charged for trespassing and destruction of property.

Did you feel this way when you were bringing me around, too?

139
00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.270
It was harder. At least kids listen.

Why?

147

What should we do? That was the last bus.

156
00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.920
Should we take a taxi?

157
00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:57.890
I bought food for the kids earlier, so...

158

What do we do?

I guess we don't have a choice, we can't go home.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.880
Always looking for opportunities.

161
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.600
Then what do we do?

162
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.010
Hand.

163
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.360
Are you tired?

164
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.920
Not really.

165
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.630
Tell me if you get tired. I'll carry you.

166
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.610
No, you'll be too tired.

167
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.440
I only make you go through trouble because I don't have any money. Why do you like me so much?

168
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.650
Because you're kind.

169
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.100
In my major, there are plenty of rich kids,

170
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.580
kids with cars, and kids who wear expensive clothes.

171
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.330
There are kids who are even good looking.

172
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.490
But none of them is as kind as you.

173
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:10.640
Not just kind, but

174
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.450
you tug at my heart.

175
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:20.040
I'm like in "Misery." I only have eyes for you.

176
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.850
That's why I know what kind of person you are.

177
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:26.740
I fell for it again.

178
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.660
I thought you were "Misery," but you were just a dummy.

179
00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:38.260
I am a dummy. Dummy for Jae Hyeon.

180
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.940
I'll give you a piggyback ride, my Dummy.

181
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.990
I'm not tired at all because I'm walking with you

182
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.860
and I'm not scared at all even though it's dark.

183
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.700
Ji Soo.

184
00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.510
Don't forget that.

185
00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:06.160
When we're together, we don't feel tired at all, and we don't feel scared no matter how dark it is.

186
00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:14.250
That's why I'm going to the demolition area again tomorrow.

187
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:24.660
Hey, it's really pretty here.

188
00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.260
I've never seen the Han River like this.

189
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.710
Wow, it's so black!

190
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.300
It's really hard to see, huh?

191
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.600
Mom.

192
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.640
Were you scared, mom?

193
00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.230
No. It was fun.

194
00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.790
But your hand is shaking.

195
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.760
I'm telling you it's not.

196
00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.790
Did you quit drinking? You haven't bought alcohol lately.

197
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.570
- I won't get any. 
 - Aigo, look at that.

198
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.620
You've matured. You leper girl.

199
00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.460
When you live with a kid, you can't drink much. I'm busy cooking.

200
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.770
Why does your face not look good?

201
00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:02.090
Granny. It's not one thing coming for everyone that goes, in my case.

202
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.600
When one goes, a whole crowd comes after me, like zombies.

203
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.000
Those zombies are indeed vicious.

204
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.140
They bite you hard, like this!

205
00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.580
You're a hip granny, knowing what a zombie is.

206
00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.580
I search for and watch all the things my son watches.

207
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.000
Granny, then should I come live here? I'll do all the housework and watch the store.

208
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.370
You can just watch TV.

209
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.110
- Not you. 
 - Why not?

210
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:33.160
The light reflects off all the alcohol bottles here. If you see it with your eyes, you're bound to drink again.

211
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.680
<i>The piano will be arriving at your house soon.</i>

212
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.420
Granny, I need to go. Think about living  with me, okay?

213
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.050
Don't run! You're going to trip and split your head open!

214
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.080
<i>For Demolition </i>

215
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:11.210
What's this?

216
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:13.420
Yeah, did you try contacting the landlord?

217
00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.930
Yes but the landlord...

218
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.650
What about the landlord?

219
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.550
It's CEO Jang.

220
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.290
What? Seo Kyeong?

221
00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:22.730
Yes, sir.

222
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.710
How can that be?

223
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.410
She purchased it a little while ago at double the original cost.

224
00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.850
Did you tell Sunbae?

225
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:36.220
Yes.

226
00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.410
Those people won't come anymore.

227
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:11.930
How did you do that?

228
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.100
The Vice President took action.

229
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.190
What action?

230
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:19.270
Who knows. I'm not too sure.

231
00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:29.230
The vice president paid the cost of the demolition but told the team to stop.

232
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.650
Stop hiding behind Jae Hyeon's back like a coward and come out.

233
00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.430
Aren't you the one that was hiding?

234
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.350
I'll go to you since your words aren't wrong.

235
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.900
Oh, Dong Jin.

236
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.820
I shall come whenever the client asks me to come. Since I'm at your service.

237
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.430
Sure, sure sure.

238
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.590
- I'm sorry. 
 - No worries, sir.

239
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:16.900
- It's because I'm a bit busy. 
 - Yes, sir.

240
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.340
Why did you suddenly ask me to come?

241
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.000
I'm going to have to ask you to submit lawsuit files.

242
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.030
Are you finally crossing over to the riverside from which you cannot return?

243
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:34.250
Grabbing on won't be any good for Seo Kyeong.

244
00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:37.980
Does getting a divorce not impact your fight with the old man?

245
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.880
It won't impact my plans, but I'm sure I'll get cursed at like there's no tomorrow.

246
00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:47.770
They'll call me the bastard who abandoned his wife and son, and who betrayed his father-in-law.

247
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:52.960
You've already been called those things! Isn't that practically your name now?

248
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.080
This crazy punk.

249
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.580
How did you know my name?

250
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:01.560
Goodness, you're such a crazy punk.

251
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.310
I heard you found out about Ji Soo's house?

252
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.760
If you knew earlier, why didn't you tell me?

253
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.670
Ji Soo did everything she could to me, from threats and blackmail to coaxing,

254
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:12.680
telling me not to tell you.

255
00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:17.340
She said it was something your wife did, so you'd have a difficult time.

256
00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.510
Chairman, the Board of Directors meeting just finished.

257
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:32.760
The resolution you desired was passed unanimously.

258
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.710
We will make the results public as soon as the market closes in the afternoon today.

259
00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:40.970
Why did you come all the way to report to me the obvious?

260
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.790
We also got contacted by the prosecutor's office just now.

261
00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:51.850
They request you make an appearance before noon two days from today.

262
00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.070
We're contacting Chief Prosecutor Kim Hak Cheol at the moment.

263
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.790
Don't worry about him now.

264
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.620
Leave.

265
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.050
I said leave.

266
00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.480
Yes, sir.

267
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:22.260
This country... is wrecked.

268
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:37.830
Vice President. An emergency board meeting was held today and they decided on a recapitalization by stock allotment to third parties.

269
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:40.230
They're due to make an official announcement after the market closes.

270
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.660
Who is the designated party?

271
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.420
"Shin Il Asset Management". It isn't very well known, not even in the financial hub of Yeouido.

272
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.400
Look into that company, and hold a meeting with all of our investors.

273
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.520
Yes, will do.

274
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:18.310
You must've bought this house without even coming here.

275
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.830
Of course. I only have one reason for buying it.

276
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.450
To shake Yoon Ji Soo.

277
00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:31.120
Even if you're the homeowner, it's illegal to demolish the property without letting me know beforehand or giving me monetary compensation.

278
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.240
That's why I came, to let you know.

279
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.590
I'm going to demolish this house.

280
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:41.820
We're good now? As for your compensation, the amount of your deposit should work.

281
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.310
The amount didn't even warrant a trip to the bank. I've also included enough for you to move.

282
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.470
Are you not going to take it?

283
00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:01.560
I'm going to follow the rules. I'm supposed to receive the deposit when I move.

284
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:07.400
Anyway, I let you know and told you I would even compensate you, so move out as soon as you can.

285
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.570
Since I'll proceed as I planned.

286
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:15.150
I'll look into it as soon as possible, so please stop the demolition for now. This is all illeg—

287
00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:19.860
I don't want to. I'm going to keep bothering and threatening you.

288
00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.380
I'm sorry, but I'll continue even if you move somewhere else.

289
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.580
Until you leave Jae Hyeon.

290
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:45.120
- Yeah, Ji Soo. 
 - Hello, I'm Yeong Min.

291
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:47.700
Oh, it's Yeong Min. What's wrong?

292
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.830
I think my mom is really sick.

293
00:26:55.340 --> 00:27:00.460
She ate some medicine, but her fever won't go down. She might have to go to the hospital.

294
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.390
Auntie Hye Jeong won't pick up the phone.

295
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:05.330
Just come here for a bit. Come here.

296
00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:08.020
If I just get a good night's rest, it'll be fine.

297
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.700
I don't think it's something that'll be resolved with a night of rest.

298
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:14.320
I know my body well. Plus, I can't leave Yeong Min alone...

299
00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:17.660
Yeong Min, you can lock the door and stay here alone right?

300
00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.260
Yes.

301
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:20.860
Okay.

302
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.760
Okay, one minute.

303
00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.880
I'm really okay.

304
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.180
Yeong Min, lock the door.

305
00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:42.160
I really don't need to go to the hospital.

306
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.020
<i>October, 1994</i>

307
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.000
You...

308
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:52.610
Why would you come to school when your fever is so bad?

309
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:57.090
It was a wish of mine to study with you at the library.

310
00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:04.010
We just barely made plans. So what if I'm a bit sick?

311
00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:06.340
It must be because we walked around all night that day.

312
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.190
Where are we going?

313
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.370
We should go to the hospital and then go home.

314
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:14.660
- I don't want to. 
 - You really...

315
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:18.420
It's our first time studying at the library together.

316
00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.040
You didn't even study.

317
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:30.000
I'm not going. I mean, I can't. The weather is so good, too.

324

No, you'll catch my cold.

325
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.520
That's the aim.

329
00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.130
Your fever has gone down a bit.

330
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.460
It's because I slept well.

331
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.490
Just stay lying down here a bit longer.

332
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.590
It's suffocating, I want to leave.

333
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:48.830
They say your face is the mirror of your heart. I can see how much you've been struggling.

334
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.830
Is my face really not that great?

335
00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:55.560
Your pretty face has become half its size.

336
00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.360
But I don't think it's a mirror into your heart.

337
00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:07.090
I'm so happy right now.

338
00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.120
It must have been hard because of your house.

339
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.550
Does love feed you?

340
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.720
When it was hard for me to live day by day, I thought of that.

341
00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:24.830
There's no such thing as a love that comes from tossing away your spoonful of rice.

342
00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:30.240
But now, I'm not in a period where I have to worry about

343
00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.670
how little rice I can get from tossing away love.

344
00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:37.440
Love became both the rice and the side dishes,

345
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.480
and it can even be a sweet dessert.

346
00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.400
I'm grateful enough with just that.

347
00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.210
I hope you'll gain a lot of weight.

348
00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:50.590
Not that.

349
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.120
<i> Seoul Family Court </i>

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.390
What are you trying to do?

352
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.390
I can't stay in the same house with you when I've filed for a divorce.

353
00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:59.800
I'm not going to take anything from you with this lawsuit.

354
00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.430
I plan on doing the things you want, as much as possible.

355
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.230
Okay. Do whatever you want.

356
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:13.250
But I don't know what a kind argument is.

357
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.230
It'll become a dog fight or a mud fight.

358
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:23.470
Whether with scratches or bites or by whatever means necessary, I'll defeat you.

Yes, ma'am.

361

Secretary Kang. One moment please.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.640
- Secretary Kang. 
 - Yes?

363
00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.340
- Where's Jae Hyeon? 
 - He's in his office.

364
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.370
I'm asking where he's been living.

365
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.100
If you don't tell me, I'll fire you.

366
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:06.390

He's here.

374
00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.300
Is it true that you're dating a single mom?

375
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.520
It is true that you were a campus couple in the past?

376
00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.620
When did your relationship become deeper again?

 - Wait!

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.920
He put crap on his own face.

381
00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.110
It's upsetting because I think some of the wastewater might splash on Seo Kyeong and me,

382
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:38.270
but what can I do? We were going to get rid of him anyway.

383
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:42.340
On the contrary, you or Miss will be flooded with sympathy votes later on—

384
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.070
Why shall I receive sympathy votes? It's useless!

385
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.730
That isn't what I meant, sir.

386
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.350
Anyway, put out headlines that say he's incompetent of directing the company,

387
00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:52.790
and that above all, there is definitely an ethical issue.

388
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:56.610
Our team members will not take this matter lightly.

389
00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.620
Yes, I understand.

390
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:02.100
I can go alone.

391
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.230
Your dad must've seen the article too. It'll be hard by yourself.

392
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.790
I'll go and tell him.

393
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.030
But I think that man is taking pictures of us.

394
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:24.620
Oh? What are you doing?

395
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:27.490
Are you aware you taking pictures of us is illegal?

396
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.200
What are you— What do you think you're doing right now?

397
00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.970
You took pictures of us. If these get published somewhere, I'm going to use my pictures to sue you.

398
00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:40.580
- Mom, the bus is here. 
 - Let's go.

399
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.760
Yeong Min, head in first.

400
00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:49.100
Yes.

401
00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.170
See you in two days, Yeong Min.

402
00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.170
I don't care about the article. I already knew about it anyway.

403
00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:09.310
The issue is that Yeong Min cannot be in such a dangerous environment any longer.

404
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:14.210
It's something Yeong Min and I will figure out. We're already discussing it plenty.

405
00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.890
I heard he decided to live with me?

406
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.960
What are you talking about?

407
00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.110
Do you not know much about your son?

408
00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:28.290
Or did you not have the time to pay attention to him because you were too busy dating?

409
00:40:28.290 --> 00:40:32.460
He says he thinks he'll only be a disturbance to your marriage.

410
00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:37.750
That's why he said he'll let mom go and live with his dad.

411
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.700
There's no way he would say that. Even until just now—

412
00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:45.560
He said you'll have a hard time because your father passed away.

413
00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:50.190
So he asked me to give you some time, and that's why I waited until now.

414
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.420
But I don't think I can wait anymore.

415
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.890
I heard your late father said this,

416
00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:03.210
That if you pick one, you must give up another.

417
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.390
I'm going to give you up now.

418
00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:19.210
In return, I'm going to bring Yeong Min to me as fast as I can.

419
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.500
<i>You said Yeong Min won't be home today, right? I'll sleep with you today.</i>

420
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.210
<i>Aren't you scared they'll come to demolish your house?</i>

421
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.960
<i>I already told my husband.</i>

422
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.610
<i>Thanks to you, I'm a free wife tonight!</i>

423
00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:52.500
Our little Yeong Min was so pretty when he was younger.

424
00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.240
What's the point of saying the obvious?

425
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.440
Even recently, I got contacted about making him a child model.

426
00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.790
So are you going to hug his pictures and cry yourself to sleep every day?

427
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.780
No. I'll have to talk about it with Yeong Min.

428
00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.720
What if he really says he'll live with his dad?

429
00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.010
- Then I have to accept that. 
 - Huh?

430
00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:21.960
But I'm going to tell him

431
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.490
not to force himself to do something he doesn't want, just to benefit someone else.

432
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.670
He's smart, so he'll understand.

433
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:38.450
When I'm next to you, my throat goes dry.

434
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:40.190
Why?

435
00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.090
Because you're so pitiful it squeezes all the water out through my eyes.

436
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:48.430
Yoon Ji Soo is so pitiful.

437
00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:04.390
Is this the Chairman Jang card you mentioned last time?

438
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:09.270
Yes. It's issuing new stocks exclusively to a specific party, instead of to the entirety of existing stockholders.

439
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.550
It's a capital increase by allotment to a third party.

440
00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.930
The recipient of that will be on Chairman Jang's side, I'm sure?

441
00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:15.760
That company called Shin Il Asset Management.

442
00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.500
That's the company that used to take care of Chairman Jang's slush funds.

443
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:22.130
So what are your plans, Vice President Han?

444
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.280
The board of directors and the management rights are still in the hands of our opponents.

445
00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.400
It doesn't seem there are any options left.

446
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:34.010
Your morality being under question is a problem for us as well.

447
00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:41.730
Excuse me for a moment.

448
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.500
Hello?

449
00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:47.190
<i>Vice President, please look at the texts I sent you.</i>

450
00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.890
Min Ji, head in first for a moment.

451
00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.610
Okay.

452
00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:06.120
Min Ji, you did well today.

453
00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.460
- Good bye. 
 - Bye.

454
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.220
Please have a seat for a moment.

455
00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:17.160
We'll stop taking lessons after today.

456
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:23.330
You gave me the months lesson fees in advance last week.

457
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:28.910
It's okay. Please just think of that as a token of gratitude.

458
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:31.860
Can I ask the reason?

459
00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:37.820
Well, I just want to be careful since my daughter is a girl after all.

460
00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:35.980
Yeong Min, don't look at your phone for the time being.

461
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.020
Why?

462
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.760
You have to study. I'll keep it for you.

463
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:43.750
Mom will probably call me.

464
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.080
If she does, I'll let you talk to her.

465
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.820
Give it.

466
00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:06.040
I'm going to find the first publisher and arrest them for violation of portrait rights and slander.

467
00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:15.320
But the first publisher of the video could be CEO Jang...

468
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:22.430
I'm sorry but, if that's the case, that's beneficial for us. Though this does seem to be turning into a dogfight.

469
00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.740
She's eating well and working as normal, too?

470
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.690
It does seem like she's been having a lot less work.

471
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:34.420
Yoon Ji Soo isn't one to run away when things get difficult for her.

472
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.490
Yes, she seems to be more tenacious than she appears.

473
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:46.480
Instead, those kinds of people cannot stand inconveniencing others.

474
00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.310
<i>Yeong Min, I'll go pick you up tomorrow around 1.</i>

475
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:12.360
Where's Yeong Min?

476
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.770
Yeong Min saw your articles and that video.

477
00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:21.690
He says he doesn't want to see you for the time being.

478
00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.520
Let me call Yeong Min.

479
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.020
He said he didn't want to call you.

480
00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.210
I'll call you as soon as Yeong Min calms down.

481
00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:35.780
I'm planning on filing for restoration of the right to custody as soon as I can.

482
00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:40.650
I know that the reason Yeong Min dropped out of school was because of you and that person.

483
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:45.950
I'm telling you there are an overflowing number of reasons why I should get custody.

484
00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:10.930
Yes, Unni.

485
00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:12.990
<i>Yeong Min's mom, are you busy right now?</i>

486
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.640
No, I'm free.

487
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.890
<i>Shall we meet up for a bit?</i>

488
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:18.360
Right now?

489
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.690
It's about Seon Hee.

490
00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:29.520
By any chance, did I not get a call from mom?

491
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:33.870
Your mom must be busy.

492
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.800
Okay.

493
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:49.910
I considered just not telling you,

494
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:53.500
but I thought it's something you should know.

495
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.430
And I knew Seon Hee wouldn't tell you.

496
00:49:56.430 --> 00:49:59.400
Did something happen to Unni Seon Hee?

497
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:07.330
She suddenly got a notice of dismissal.

498
00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:08.640
Why?

499
00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:14.290
Well, officially it was for poor job performance,

500
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:18.000
but apparently CEO Jang ordered it herself.

501
00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:26.210
<i>The person you are trying to call...</i>

502
00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.120
<i>I can't pick up</i>

503
00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:32.390
<i>If you have something to say to me, come to my office tomorrow.</i>

504
00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.060
I'm in the lobby.

505
00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:41.460
<i>Ah, Yeong Min's mother. But why did you call me yesterday, by the way?</i>

506
00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.960
I won't stay still about Choi Seon Hee's situation. It's definitely illegal, and—

507
00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.750
If you're coming to talk about that, then I'm sorry, but I have no plans of meeting you.

508
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:58.530
Other than Choi Seon Hee, weren't there many cashiers who were reinstated back then?

509
00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.280
Is it Yeong Min's mom, by chance?

510
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:05.920
She says she's in the lobby.

511
00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:09.680
Goodness, isn't that just too shameless?

512
00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.980
Let's just drink our teas and not worry about it.

513
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.180
Long time no see, Yeong Min's mom.

514
00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.390
What are you doing?

515
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:53.110
How are you going to take responsibility for soiling the school's reputation?

516
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:58.160
Rumors are everywhere that the two of you first met as fellow parents of our school's pupils.

517
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.220
But you're still walking around trouble-free, so shamelessly.

518
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.210
Why are you looking at me like that?

519
00:52:05.210 --> 00:52:07.630
What? Are you going to twist my arm again?

520
00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:11.010
Unni, let's just go now.

521
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.970
Ji Soo.

522
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:01.230
Yeong Woo.

523
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:05.220
Is something wrong?

524
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:09.980
What's all this?

525
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.890
It's late. I'll see you later.

526
00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:18.020
Who did this?

527
00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:22.210
I did.

528
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.440
<i>I don't want to. </i>

529
00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.410
<i>I'm going to keep bothering and threatening you.</i>

530
00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:51.890
<i>Yeong Min saw your articles and that video.</i>

531
00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.490
<i>She suddenly got a notice of dismissal.</i>

532
00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:59.320
<i>Apparently CEO Jang ordered it herself.</i>

533
00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:06.380
<i>Other than Choi Seon Hee, weren't there many cashiers who were reinstated back then?</i>

534
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:14.600
Don't you think you are being cowardly?

535
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.920
Why are you making Ji Soo stand on the ledge while you're just watching her from behind?

536
00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.510
Are you going to pick her up and run only after she falls?

537
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:28.670
Why aren't you thinking of how she's alone in such a scary place?

538
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:35.220
Ji Soo is suffering so much that I can't even stand to watch her from afar.

539
00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:39.800
I...

540
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:45.870
There's nothing I can do.

541
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.200
If there was, I would do whatever that be.

542
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.540
But other than acting like this towards you,

543
00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.270
there is nothing I can do.

544
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:05.490
Please stay next to Ji Soo.

545
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:08.170
Don't make her stand there alone.

546
00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:10.870
Whether it snows, rains, or blows heavy winds,

547
00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.220
if the two of you endure together,

548
00:55:16.820 --> 00:55:19.630
then I too...

549
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.050
I think I can live, too.

550
00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:00.790
<i>Now I'm also going to do what will cause you the most pain.</i>

551
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.780
<i>Something that you can never do, even if you were to pour </i>

552
00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.630
<i>all of your power, money and time. </i>

553
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.520
Tell Secretary Kim to come in.

554
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.220
Where did you say that woman went?

555
00:56:56.220 --> 00:57:01.190
The hotel where the Vice President is.

556
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.330
What about Jae Hyeon?

557
00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:28.750
Where's Jae Hyeon?

558
00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:57.130
You're crazy too.
