00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.760
Love Is All

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.060
Adviser Tan's Big Crisis?!
Break into Tian Xiang Club for Significant meritorious service!
Episode 02

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.040
Sis.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.720
I'm so sleepy.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.800
Sleep after 1 am, Get up before 5 am.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.000
That's boys' study time.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.800
But I'm a girl.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.800
Girls always be late for showering and making up.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.470
Zhuang.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.390
Have we made a fortune?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.550
Pig's feet for breakfast?

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.360
It's your first day of being adviser.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.000
So I wish you all the best.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.360
Thanks, guys.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.550
I won't disappoint you

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.750
and be a qualified adviser.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.550
Sis. Being a qualified adviser is not your goal.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.600
I've been thinking

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.320
for a whole night yesterday.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.800
I think being an adviser will be quite fun.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.200
There was once Mulan joining the army.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.110
There is now Lingyin being an adviser.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.750
I'll let men in the County Office know

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.320
what is called “Women are no inferior to men”.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.830
By the way, how's the sales of my prequel?

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.960
It's so good.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.470
No book has sold as well as this one.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.910
Readers are asking when will the next one come out.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.080
They said they'll wait till next month or destroy our bookstore.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.270
That's so violent.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.240
Are ritual instructors here yet?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.080
My lord.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.910
We've counted the weapons in the county office.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.440
Most of them disappeared.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.320
Maybe officers take it as their salary

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.720
after Mr. Sang left.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.560
How about the money and grain record manual?

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.110
It was taken by adviser Tan.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.960
She'll check it first.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.320
She's quite obedient.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.520
Where is she?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.320
Adviser said there's something need to deal with in

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.600
in her bookstore,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.440
so she might be in her bookstore now.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.270
But she also said that

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.240
she'll be back as soon as the thing is done.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.390
Did you tell her that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.440
I've been away on business all morning?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.190
My lord, I told her.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.960
But she said while the cat away,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.110
the mice will play.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.269
She said I'm a cat?

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.269
My lord. Adviser said that

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.830
you're the mice.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.640
Come back.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.160
My lord.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.200
Go to Zheng Shaofeng's room.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.110
Take Miaomiaosheng's novel to me.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.600
What about the ritual instructors?

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.230
Tell them that I have

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.580
something important that I need to go out.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.110
Everyone, take it easy.

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.160
Please line up. We still have a lot of it.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.790
Next.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:47.110
Cut the crap.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.720
I've waited in here since 3 am.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.040
And I haven't bought it now.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.000
We're so sorry.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.830
Sorry.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.830
Our business is so good.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.880
Why you look so worried?

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.390
Sis. Today is your first day in the county office.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.920
Now, it's already 7 am.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.440
And you're still here.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.270
Customers almost fight each other in a minute.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.320
How should I leave you alone here?

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.270
But I think

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.670
you'd better go to the county office first.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.830
Don't worry.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.390
Mr. Tang is not in the office today.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.160
Do you have any left?

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.110
See. There's a lot there.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.200
We're almost there.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.230
Fang. What's going on there?

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.160
Sis Lingyin.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.510
There's a customer

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.110
who bought over 50 books from us today.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.670
All we have left is this stock now.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.070
Why it's sold out again?!

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.550
Yeah!

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.550
Everyone. We're so sorry.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.320
Today, all books of our bookstore are sold out.

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320
We'll close now.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.350
Later, we'll give a number to each of you.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.070
You can take the number to here tomorrow

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.670
and buy it as the order.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.750
How can you do it like that!

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.320
Please calm down.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.920
Fang. Prepare a bookmark

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.790
signed by Miaomiaosheng for everyone as a compensation.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.920
Please forgive us. Thank you, everyone.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.270
Have a look here.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.230
Miaomiaosheng's novel, 50 wen each.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.720
50 wen?!

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.550
50 wen each.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.110
Really?!

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.550
Have a look. Let's go!

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.440
What happened?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.110
What's going on?

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.600
Miaomiaosheng's novel, 50 wen each.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.790
Have a look.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.880
Wait for me.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.200
Take it easy.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.670
It's so cheap.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:11.160
50 wen.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.790
This is charged 100 wen each in the bookstore.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:13.350
Yeah.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.440
I want one. I want one.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.110
I want one.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.390
That's right. It's for real.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.070
Give it to me.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.000
Go. Go. Go.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.790
Don't worry. There's a lot here.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.510
50 wen. Here you are.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.320
Adviser Tan. Why you're here?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.230
Seriously? Mr. Tang?

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.920
Why you don't do business in the county office,

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.830
and mess up my business here?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.880
I'm just on board recently.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.200
I need to sell all of these stuffs

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.640
so that I have to money to pay the salary.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.320
Yes.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.550
It's okay if you don't work.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.950
But you even hang around with your officers here?

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.070
Li Dawang, I'm disappointed with you.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.510
I…

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.550
My lord. I…

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.950
I'm hanging around here?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.320
Why you're here instead of working in the county office?

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.790
It's already the afternoon.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.760
If you still not finished checking the household registration,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.920
when your probation period ends,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.880
at that time,

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.000
don't say that I didn't give you the chance.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.920
Sis, don't go the county office then.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.880
No way! Give the water bottle to me.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.480
If I won't visit 100 families today,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.920
I will write my name backwards!

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.790
Are you still selling it?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:16.920
Go on.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.600
Okay. Go on!

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.830
Give me 2.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.550
Come on.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:23.760
Look.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.600
This is the profit of our bookstore this month.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.920
It's much higher than the salary of the county office.

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.390
It is pretty good.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.000
Thanks to this book.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.440
If we can't come out the next one,

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.350
we won't earn as much as this.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.720
But you made up story

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.880
in front of Mr. Tang.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.110
How long will you hide from him

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.500
about your Miaomiaosheng's identity?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.880
Relax.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.320
He seems like quite stupid.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.880
I'm a such clever girl. I can definitely handle it.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.480
Anyway. I'll continue to stay in the county office.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.920
I need to experience it

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.070
and be responsible for my readers.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.270
My lord! My lord!

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:57.670
Bad news!

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.920
My lord! Adviser is murdered!

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.830
This room is so messed up.

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.480
And there were obvious signs of fighting.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.480
An empty pouch is next to the body.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.070
It shows that it's burglary.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.720
This knife has not been sharpened.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.950
How to explain the blood on it?

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.590
The blood is still warm.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.470
Why it has

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.230
a light smell of peony?

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.080
Qian Five.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.590
It means No. 5 of lines in the Qian Hexagram.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.150
Fly in the sky to see the man of high prestige.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.590
So the murder is Tang Feilong!

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.350
Okay. This body.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.320
Oh. No.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.150
The fool who pretended to be a dead.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:04.760
You can get up now.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.640
Fake one is fake.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.440
It's easy to be found out.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.550
It has nothing to do with that.

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.710
You're pretending to be dead.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.470
But you can't even hold your breath.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.150
Your breast is up and down.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.840
The files are almost blowed away by you.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840
Lothario!

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.640
The county office is not a place for fun.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.760
What do you want?

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.710
I just want to test your ability of detection.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.960
How's it?

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:37.710
Well, it's me here.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.080
If it's the girl you loved,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.590
you'll pass out at once,

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.910
and no time for you to observe the breast.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.350
Will the girl I loved

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:49.280
be such stupid?

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.550
People with different personalities

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.440
are more attracted to each other.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.670
Is it so excited?

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.320
In Tongling,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.840
there hasn't been a single murder in decades.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.400
If you came here for excitement,

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.550
you will be disappointed.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.470
There's one day left for your probation.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.710
Have you finished 300 families' visiting?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.840
My lord.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.080
I just…I…I…

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.280
I just take a break now.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.200
I'll go this afternoon.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.840
Xiao Liu, let's go.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.760
Looks like Tang Feilong is good at

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760
analyzing the case.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:33.550
Adviser.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:34.710
I can add that part into my next novel.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.550
Adviser?

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.350
Look.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.840
Mr. Tang

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.550
is not someone who you can easily get along with, right?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.200
You're a girl.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.030
Why you hang around with men here

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.880
all the time?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.670
You must don't know that

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.640
in our county office,

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.670
we don't even have the place to poo poo.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:53.640
What?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.400
Toliet.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.550
Build one. It's not a big deal.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.880
That does make sense. Wait, adviser.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.030
What happened?

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.470
They are so poor.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:12.590
Mrs. Bai's husband

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:13.910
was very sick since last month.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.230
To save her husband,

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.200
she borrowed a lot of money.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.790
Yesterday,

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.320
her husband just died,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.320
and the dunner is here now.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.840
How will she live after that?

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.520
Yeah.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.670
She will raise her child by herself.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.320
The dunner even tried to rob her daughter

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.670
as the pay back of the debt.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.280
They've gone too far!

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:35.470
It's really unfair.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.760
Adviser.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.320
Such dirty business.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.110
We'd better not be involved into it.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.360
I'll definitely handle it today.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.880
Miss.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.350
Don't hurt yourself.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.640
Miss. Don't stop us.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.680
My daughter would rather to die

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.450
instead of being a whore in Tian Xiang Club.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.230
Tian Xiang Club?

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.400
Is it the most famous restaurant in Tongling?

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.550
You are?

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:10.400
I'm the new adviser of Tongling County.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.230
Tan Lingyin.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.320
To save my father, my mom

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.640
believed the word of Tian Xiang Club's staffs,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.110
and borrowed 5 tael from Tian Xiang Club.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.790
Including interest, it's 20 tael in total now.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.280
It has the signed contract,

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.520
so there's nothing you can change now.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.350
But Mrs. Bai,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:32.200
you can earn money and pay back to them.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.640
There's really nothing you can do if you died.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.670
We've already paid back.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.910
We're not deadbeats.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.080
You might not know that

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.110
we've already paid it off for the 20 tael.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.880
But the stamp on the receipt

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.710
suddenly disappeared.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.790
So they didn't admit it and said we didn't pay it off.

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.790
Can I see your receipt?

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.470
There is no stamp on it.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.400
Did you make any mistake?

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.110
That's impossible.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:05.910
Every penny we have

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.790
is saved by us.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:10.960
It's 20 tael!

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.110
It can buy 2 houses and 5 mu of land.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.080
How can we make a mistake?

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:17.440
See?

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.670
They said I didn't pay off the debt yesterday.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.710
And they wanna take my daughter from me today.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.080
This is so weird.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.320
If they want to get the money back,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:33.840
they should come to your home,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.200
and take valuables first.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.520
Oh. I see. It must be a trap.

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.670
Their target is you.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.030
Hey bitch. Have you decided yet?

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.790
Let us wait for so long.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.080
I'll freshen up and come right away.

00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:57.790
See? We can surely get her.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.320
Right?

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.400
We need to leave someone here to watch.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.230
Yeah.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.960
I've already said goodbye to my mom.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:04.080
We can leave now.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.960
You're quite obedient. Let's go.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.400
They really took her?!

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:10.000
Go. Go.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.550
I'm going to destroy the hideout of the bad guys!

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.590
My lord!

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.030
There's an invitation from Tian Xiang Club's staff.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:35.590
Zhang Zhiyuan

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.470
is the boss of Tian Xiang Club?

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.710
Yes, my lord. Tian Xiang Club

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:42.760
is the biggest restaurant in Tongling.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.110
Is that a restaurant or a brothel?

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.320
I've checked the file.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.200
There're over 10 cases about

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.910
bullying and usury.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.550
As long as it's handled by Sang Jie

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.710
about Tian Xiang Club, there's no result at the end.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.910
You've been followed Sang Jie for years.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.440
You should know that clearly than me.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.640
My lord.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.670
I'm just an officer.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:09.200
I'm just a little potato in here. I'm not dare to say anything.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:12.280
Please forgive me, my lord.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.550
Last county magistrate was just on board within 3 months,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.520
and he took 1,200 tael from Tian Xiang Club.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:20.280
What a cash cow!

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.110
My lord, will you still go?

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:25.030
Of course.

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.790
Such a great thing. Why shouldn't I?

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.320
My lord.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.930
<i>Tian Xiang Club</i>

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.400
Have you sent the invitation letter

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.640
to our new county magistrate?

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.280
Yes. He agreed to meet you here soon.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:53.590
When Mr. Sang was here,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:57.670
our business was not bad.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.400
But we barely know about

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.110
the new county magistrate...

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.640
It's said that this magistrate

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.070
is a bit hard to handle.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.100
When he was just on board,

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.470
he sorted out all the internal affairs in the County Office.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.020
And he even took a careful check

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:13.980
over the relief fund in three years.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.030
I'm afraid he's not easy to cope with.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.280
No matter he's easy or not,

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.910
he has no choice but accept my proposal.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.150
Cause it's beneficial.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.710
Wait.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.280
Who is she?

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.350
The girl from family Bai, just arrived here today.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.000
Yun Er.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:01.280
Take... take her to my room, now!

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.760
Yes.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.950
It's surely a good place to hide beauties.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:12.829
When I find the evidence

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.639
and show the truth,

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.520
that's the time I build up my career.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.710
What's this? Ink paste?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:41.940
What are you doing?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.140
You're really lucky.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:44.980
You just came here

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.880
and got the chance to serve upper class people.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:48.300
You'd better remember that

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.110
Mr. Zhang always stutter when seeing beauty.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.800
Don't say anything offensive in front of him.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.920
Otherwise, you'll be punished.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.750
Chun Hua, Qiu Yue, get her changed.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.590
Wait.

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:04.110
Mama, I will dress myself neatly

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.950
and serve Mr. Zhang well.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.640
Good girl, from now on

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.920
you just follow me.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.350
Let's go.

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.280
My lord, my lord!

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:23.470
What's wrong?

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.520
Where's lord Tang?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.880
He went to Tian Xiang Club.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.350
Why you're in hurry?

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:28.710
Tian Xiang Club?

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:42.430
Mr. Tang.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.830
How's the dishes today?

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.350
Pretty well.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.680
But what about the other business

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.400
of Tian Xiang Club?

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:54.640
Well...

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:58.800
Mr. Tang, you're joking.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.350
Tian Xiang Club is just

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.470
a little shoestring restaurant.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.350
People come here for snacks and accommodation.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.400
How could there be other businesses?

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.660
About the death of the former county magistrate Sang Jie,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.200
I checked his account books.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.280
There are a lot of suspicious things.

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:16.800
Is it because he was unlucky,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.590
or he's not destined to spend his fortune,

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:22.520
and accept your kindness?

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:27.430
My lord.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.720
Well,

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.340
I listened to you so intently

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.520
when you were talking

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.300
that I dropped my glass.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:34.710
I'm so sorry.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:36.350
I'll arrange someone

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.180
to help you get changed.

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.620
Be careful don't catch a cold.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.830
All leave. Quickly.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.450
Fine. Fine.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.350
So you're Mr. Zhang, the boss of Tian Xiang Club?

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.170
Yes. It's me.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.070
Since you've joined in our Tian Xiang Club,

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.420
we are a...a family now.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.590
So, in the future,

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.250
we need to share fortunes

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.560
and hardship with each other.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.640
Of course, there's no much hardship here.

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.710
However,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.280
there's a guest today

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.970
got me in trouble.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.710
We've agreed to sign the contract today,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.880
but he suddenly changed his mind,

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.400
which makes me in dilemma.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.520
I'll handle it.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.040
What can I do for you?

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.950
It's quite easy though.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.430
Just let him take out the stamp he brought

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.640
and put on it.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.000
That's all.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.430
Let him join our family.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.680
OK. I got it.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.400
Use this ink paste.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:50.110
OK.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.160
My lord.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.230
You can get changed now.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.680
Are you done?

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.190
Never mind. All bad guys.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.190
You're all the same.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.060
Once I put stamp on, you can't get away with it either.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:31.640
When I get back to County Office,

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.920
each of you will be caught.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:43.920
Tang Feilong?

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:58.110
Mr. Tang, you're truly a young blood.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.920
Already started?

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.340
Mr. Tang, from today,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.920
you've officially joined in our Tian Xiang Club.

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.950
The profit sharing remains

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.310
as same as the former magistrate.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.800
30% to you, 70% to me. OK?

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:20.640
Why are you here?

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.490
Zhang Zhiyuan, you set me up?

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:27.530
Mr. Tang, how could you say it like this?

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.920
It's your decision to negotiate with

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.660
the leading girl of our Tian Xiang Club.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.160
How can that be setting up?

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:38.150
How can she be the leading girl of Tian Xiang Club?

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.590
She's my adviser.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:41.180
Adviser?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.960
That's even better.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.110
It seems that

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:46.280
from now on,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.000
your adviser got a part-time job here.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:54.040
Perfect.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:00.950
So I'm really the leading girl of Tian Xiang Club now?

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.190
What an idiot.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.350
My lord, my lord, please help me.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.310
<i>Chizhou District Office</i>

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.710
<i>District Magistrate of Chizhou | Song Yinglin</i>

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.830
<i>The adopted daughter of Song Yinglin | Zhou Ruyi</i>

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:00.690
Good.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.490
Others can leave.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.470
I've trained you for so many years,

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.350
now it's your time to get on stage.

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.040
Yesterday I went to Tongling to inquire again,

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.590
and got nothing.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.020
This...

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.110
The words on the streets don't mean anything.

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.870
You need to get into the County Office.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.160
But the position of county magistrate

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.890
has been arranged by the capital long before.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:36.350
Though they've sent the county magistrate here,

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:40.350
the position of magistrate assistant is still available.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:43.970
I don't understand.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.710
Do you know why I chose you?

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.090
You know how to get things done by enduring silently,

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.310
and you're better at disguising.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:04.830
I understand now.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:09.350
Hya!

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.390
Someone coming.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.800
Here.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.830
Be quick.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.920
Judging by the horse, he's quite rich.

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.710
Coming.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:42.160
A girl.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.310
I didn't know this is your place.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.390
Sorry for my imprudence.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.470
This silver is for you

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.760
to buy drinks.

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.520
<i>Duan Feng | the bandit chief of the Phoenix Village</i>

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.470
That's all?

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.380
I'm afraid it's not enough.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.950
Let her go.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.160
Get on, miss.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.190
Hey bro, if you want a fight, then we fight,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.230
how could you just take someone and run away?

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.620
Such a disgusting bastard like you who makes me wanna killed.

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.910
Bring it on.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.160
Boss, hornets.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:49.830
Get down, everyone.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.920
Get up and fight.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.560
Or I'll leave then.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:04.400
A bunch of idlers,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.760
how dare you mess with me?

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:09.190
See you.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.040
<i>Tongling County Office</i>

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.470
Are you leaving or not?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.430
Just give me a chance.

00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:02.640
I've realized my mistake.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:04.880
I didn't do it on purpose.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:06.790
No way.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:07.430
This...

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:08.340
What happened?

00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:09.640
He wants to kick me out.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.180
Hurry and  intercede with me.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.500
Shut your mouth.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:14.890
Our adviser is so bold,

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.760
she hasn't been an adviser for two days,

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:18.880
and she becomes the leading girl of Tian Xiang Club,

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.530
and even stole my official stamp.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.250
What's more absurd,

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.250
I'm now the boss of a brothel!

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:26.430
Profit sharing?

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.260
It's all my fault.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.230
Just...

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:33.490
Just give me a chance.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.380
You know it's your fault?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.710
Great.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.990
Get out of here then.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:42.310
Maybe adviser Tan

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.000
has her own reason, right?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Yes, yes. I went to Tian Xiang Club

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.280
just to search for evidence.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.680
I really didn't mean to drag you in.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.110
Right? It's an accident.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.280
Yes, yes.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:54.380
An accident.

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.530
My lord, how about just giving her another chance?

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:00.600
Yes, after all,

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.110
our adviser is a girl.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.280
even if she doesn't know the rule,

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.950
she wouldn't ruin her reputation.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.710
What's more important now,

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.950
is to arrest those criminals in Tian Xiang Club,

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.330
instead of punishing our own people.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.310
Look at yourself.

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.610
You don't have a tender heart for the fair sex.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.000
You're right.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.780
My lord,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.900
please give me a chance.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.570
I'll definitely find the evidence for you.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.470
You three can go now.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.520
Yes.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.200
According to what she said,

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.710
Tang, you also went to Tian Xiang Club?

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.550
I didn't even start to enjoy...

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.400
I didn't even start to investigate,

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.760
and she messed up everything.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:49.320
There's another solution.

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:52.520
The stamp on it is under the name of Tang Feilong.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.640
I know what you mean.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.950
You mean that

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:01.760
I can just cover it up with my true identity as Tang Tianyuan?

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.980
No.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:05.880
We just arrived in Tongling.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.880
And it's not the time to put our cards on the table.

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:08.930
Then what to do?

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:10.520
We haven't do nothing and we failed.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:11.060
You...

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.820
You wanna go back with the identity as a whore master.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:15.880
I can just arrest him first.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.860
What if he threatens you with the contract?

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.780
At least he should know that he mess with the wrong person.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.560
By the way, how is that thing going?

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.760
Perfect.

00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:34.060
Go to the backyard.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.590
How could the stamp on it just disappear?

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.800
It's so strange.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.470
There must be something wrong with it.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.560
His lordship said it's the fragrance of peony.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.430
Yes. The ink paste is not right.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:33.950
Not this one.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:46.400
It's this one.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.040
Where are you going?

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:15.470
Go get her.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:18.680
Help me! Help me!

00:32:19.912 --> 00:32:22.824
