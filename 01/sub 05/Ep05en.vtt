Give me your hand.

24
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.760
That really scared me to death.

25
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.290
Let me tell you, I almost didn't recover.

26
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.600
Hello? What were you doing just now?

27
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.830
You didn't even pick up the phone.

28
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.850
Okay, that's fine then. Just live in your game then.

29
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.530
Bye.

30
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.630
Sorry to trouble you.

31
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.710
I couldn't find Cai Yasi.

32
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.100
and I don't know any other male classmates.

33
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.080
But you happened to call me recently, so I...

34
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.810
I'll go back to my dorm from here.

35
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.250
Thank you for today.

36
00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
I made you come all this way.

37
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.490
Sorry about that.

38
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.720
It's okay. I was close by anyway.

<i>- Hello?
- Um... I'm trapped in the elevator.</i>

40
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.480
Then I'll go now. Thanks for helping me, I'll repay you when I get the opportunity to.

41
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.070
Wait.

42
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.460
What is it?

43
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.650
I'll take you back.

44
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.790
Why?

45
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.490
Didn't you say there was a weird person following you?

46
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.240
Let's go.

47
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.320
Okay, thanks.

48
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.930
It's right there. We're almost there.

49
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.970
It's him! It's him!

50
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.100
Why is he here?

51
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.490
Fang Wei!

52
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.330
You're here.

53
00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.010
For you.

54
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.790
And this.

55
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.730
A snack box. I made it myself.

56
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.090
You're so sweet.

57
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.450
- There are candy and this...
- What's happening here?

58
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.590
It's so cute!

59
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.040
- Do you like it? 
 - Yes.

60
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.120
What's this?

61
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.090
This is the gift Fang Wei gave me.

62
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:30.760
When did you guys start dating?

63
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.170
How come I didn't know?

64
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.560
After the College Entrance Exam, I confessed to him,

65
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.860
and then we started dating.

66
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.620
Not bad, our Lazy Ling-ling.

67
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.870
I always thought everyone in our dorm was single.

68
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.820
I didn't think that you would be in disguise.

69
00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.750
You look like a Lazy Goat, but you're actually a Big Wolf. 
<i>(T/N: Reference to cartoon: Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf)</i>

70
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.330
Stop calling me lazy.

71
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.920
The reason why we fought this time was because I'm too lazy.

72
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.010
I didn't go to the library to study with him.

73
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.950
Then why did the Dorm Auntie say

74
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.680
that Fang Wei's stuff was for Xiao Lu.

75
00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.610
Auntie probably misunderstood.

76
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.220
<i>Tao Ling, why are you angry again?</i>

77
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.900
<i>Stop following me.</i>

78
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.590
<i>But... if you need to say something just tell me properly.</i>

79
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.040
<i>I don't have anything to say you.</i>

80
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.750
<i>If you don't want to go to the  library then fine.</i>

81
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.230
<i>Why did you block me on messages?</i>

82
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.420
<i>We're fighting and you're not even comforting me. Why should I keep you?</i>

83
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.870
<i>Besides, I've unblocked you before but you didn't realize it.</i>

84
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.460
<i>Can you stop being so stubborn?</i>

85
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.010
<i>If I'm so stubborn then stop following me.</i>

86
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.550
<i>You know that I can't stand any nonsense these couple of days.</i>

87
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.970
<i>Goodbye.</i>

88
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.340
<i>- Auntie, hello.
- Hello.</i>

89
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.130
<i>Hello, the number you have dialed...</i>

90
00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.490
<i>Hello, the number you have dialed...</i>

91
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.240
<i>Auntie.</i>

92
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.740
<i>Can you give this to Tao Ling in room 415?</i>

93
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.220
<i>Who's Tao Ling?</i>

94
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.700
<i>The girl who just went up.</i>

95
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.950
<i>The girl with long legs?</i>

96
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.200
<i>- Yes.
- Okay, put it here.</i>

97
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.920
<i>Thank you, Auntie. I'll get going now.</i>

98
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.690
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.</i>

99
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.270
Long legs?

100
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.920
What do you mean by that? Are my legs not long?

101
00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.750
My legs are just a little bigger than everyone else's.

102
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.920
But that doesn't affect its length.

103
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.770
It doesn't, it doesn't.

104
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.190
I'm not talking to you anymore. We're going to go on a date.

105
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.460
Let's go.

106
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.740
Bye-bye.

107
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.050
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

108
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.820
I guess it was all a misunderstanding.

109
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.480
But still, thank you for today.

110
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.080
Treat me to a meal.

111
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.250
Didn't you say you wanted to thank me?

112
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.590
That's true. You saved me, I should treat you to a meal.

113
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.100
Okay, then. You can choose the place. Tell me once you've decided.

114
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.190
I'll get going now. Bye-bye.

115
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.710
I only have ¥100 left, and you're going to take it away?

116
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.420
I'll pay you back in two days. In two days, it'll be the 1st.

117
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:38.890
When you were helping out Cai Yasi in the past, you should've realized it.

118
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.050
I really thought I calculated everything.

119
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.010
But how was I supposed to know that Zhao Fanzhou would come out halfway and ask me to treat him to a meal?

120
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.550
I got it. I'll just beg Fang Wei to raise me for a few days.

121
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.400
Love you! Transfer through Wechat then. Come on.

122
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.340
- I'll transfer it in a bit. Why are you rushing me?
 - Hurry, hurry.

123
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.400
- Love you!
- You took all my money.

124
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.430
I only have ¥50 left.

125
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.560
Then give me ¥25.

126
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.000
Zhou Xiao, are you still a human?

127
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.040
Okay, how much more do you need?

128
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.790
How much do you have?

129
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.130
¥200.

130
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.880
Deal.

131
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:27.230
Where are you guys even going to eat? Making all of us fund you.

132
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.210
He sent me the location at some mall.

133
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.230
He said we'll find a restaurant in the mall.

134
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.600
I searched up the nearby areas and I have a bad feeling about this.

135
00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.360
So I guess he wanted to rip you off. I thought he wanted to court you.

136
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.550
Please let me go. Don't say something unlucky like that.

137
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:44.460
My heart isn't great.

138
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.530
Where are you guys meeting up? Should you be leaving now?

139
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.390
We should be meeting up at the front of the mall.

140
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.180
There's no need to hurry. It'll only take around 10 minutes to get there.

141
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.920
Just give me the ¥25 first.

142
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.590
Okay.

143
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.400
Why are you here?

144
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.480
Are we not going to eat?

145
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.640
I'm waiting for you.

146
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.260
Waiting for me?

147
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.650
Oh right. Taking a taxi together could save some money.

148

Let's go.

149

But I think taking the bus would be easier and better for the environment.

150
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.510
Then we'll take the bus.

151
00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:40.180

Yes. Remember when I got trapped in an elevator last time?

Yeah, I don't eat them.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.650
When I was little, my mom would hit me because I wouldn't eat carrots.

215
00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.290
I remember once in preschool,

216
00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:47.650
I swore to marry the person who would eat the carrots for me.

217
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.860
At that time, Cai Yasi was eating the carrots for me.

218
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.600
He heard and started crying.

219
00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.530
That idiot.

You didn't even eat one bite of it.

Then, what are you going to eat next month?

I'll eat Cai Yasi's food. He ate a lot of mine last month.

256
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.040
You can just pay in installments.

That's so complicated and I'll have to consider it every month.

316
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.480
And mine was a limited edition.

317
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.930
Then, why must you talk to me?

318
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.690
Can't we act like we don't know each other?

319
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.120
But we do know each other.

320
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.170
Okay, let's start class.

321
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.580
<i>Last class, we found how to...</i>

322
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.630
I didn't attend the past classes.

323
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:44.280
- Can you lend me your notes? 
 <i>- We introduced...</i>

324
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.230
I don't have notes.

325
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.960
- No way. 
 <i>- For today's class, we will strongly emphasize...</i>

326
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.820
You look like a good student.

327
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.320
You didn't even take notes?

328
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.590
No one takes notes in an ideology and moral cultivation class.

329
00:22:57.590 --> 00:23:00.430
Then, what do you learn in this class?

330
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.940
First, you need to learn how to shut up.

331
00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:09.040
<i> Community service is one of the foundations of morality's origins.</i>

332
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.750
<i>Today, we talked about...</i>

333
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.000
<i>these main points, I hope everyone can...</i>

334
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.400
- Such a bad temper.
- <i>Next class, we'll do some experiments. </i>

335
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.400
<i>If there's anything you don't understand...</i>

336
00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.800
I have last year's notes regarding the Student Association work right here.

337
00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.600
Look at them carefully. Then you'll get the basic idea of our work.

338
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.000
If you have any questions, feel free to ask us anytime.

339
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.800
Thank you, Senior Sisters.

340
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.600
Oh right. I just ordered some pizza. It'll be here soon. Let's eat together.

341
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.200
Sorry, I already have plans. How about you guys go ahead?

342
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.400
I can't go either. The advisor needs me for something. Sorry about that.

343
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.800
It's okay.

344
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.600
I'll bring it back to my dorm for my roommates.

345
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.400
But really, thank you, Senior Sisters.

346
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.400
- If it weren't for you guys, I wouldn't have understood all of this so quickly.
- Isn't this the Student Association?

347
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.400
Don't be so polite.

348
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.000
Next time, we'll treat you.

349
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.630
Do we have to pay rent?

350
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I'm joking.

351
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:08.700
We're here.

352
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.400
"Detective Club. Skateboarding Club. Photography Club."

353
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.800
Because we have a lot of clubs and limited rooms,

354
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.200
we have to assign multiple clubs to one room.

355
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.800
That's okay. It doesn't really matter.

356
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.400
Open the door then, President.

357
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.200
This area is for the Detective Club.

358
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.100
This area?

359
00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.300
Photography Club.

360
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:56.290
Skateboarding Club.

361
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.800
Detective Club.

362
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:08.800
Then... doesn't that mean...

363
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:10.800
I can use all of this?

364
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.000
Yes.

365
00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.000
I can?

366
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.900
Then I can use all of this, too?

367
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.600
Wow, we saved a lot of expenses with all of this.

368
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.000
We've got the room, and I'm basically done organizing the event.

369
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.400
I've even thought of the name for our Detective Club.

370
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.100
It'll be called... Wait. Let me find a space.

371
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:44.000
We'll hang it up right here. It'll say "Southern University Detective Office."

372
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.800
Let's salute to our beloved Conan!

373
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.200
It really is you guys.

374
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.900
I thought I saw wrong. I'm not bothering you guys, right?

375
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.800
No, you're fine. You're looking for Zhao Fanzhou, right?

376
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.600
Then I'll go eat then. You guys go ahead.

377
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.200
Wait.

378
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.800
What did you need to talk to me about? We were just discussing the events for our club.

379
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.200
It's nothing, really. I was just passing by.

380
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:18.100
For the hacker thing... I haven't apologized to Zhou Xiao yet.

381
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.400
Me? It's okay. I've forgiven you.

382
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.400
I bought pizza. I was going to eat it with the Senior Sisters,

383
00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.000
but they had to do something and I can't finish all of this on my own.

384
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.600
How about the three of us eat together?

385
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.700
It's okay. I'll just go to the cafeteria.

386
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.400
You're not still mad at me, are you?

387
00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.300
No, no. Then...

388
00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.800
Then let's eat together.

389
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.600
Fanzhou, did you join the Detective Club?

390
00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.800
I didn't know you were interested in detectives.

391
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.600
It's pretty interesting.

392
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:03.200
Really? I've been looking at a bunch of clubs recently.

393
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.100
How about... I join, too?

394
00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.500
Sorry, our club's full.

395
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.800
It's okay. I was joking.

396
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:18.500
Sorry.

397
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.200
There's carrots on that piece. I'll grab another one.

398
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.100
Cai Yasi.

399
00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.000
You two are together?

400
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.400
Yes.

401
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.500
Does Zhou Xiao know?

402
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.600
- Yes.
- Yeah.

403
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.400
Let's sit.

404
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.800
- What? 
 - Go sit over there.

405
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.700
Leave this seat for Zhou Xiao.

406
00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:13.700
You always talk about Zhou Xiao.

407
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.200
Where is she?

408
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:18.000
I don't know. You're her roommate, why are you asking me?

409
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
You guys are brothers (good buddies), how do you not know?

410
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
You guys should hurry up and call her.

411
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.200
Okay. You call.

412
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.000
What do you want to drink?

413
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000
I want to drink this one.

414
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.600
Hello? Cai Yasi, what do you want again?

415
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.400
<i>Why aren't you here yet?</i>

416
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.500
<i>Huh? Where?</i>

417
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.000
High school classmate reunion. You didn't know?

418
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.200
<i>Huh? No one told me.</i>

419
00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.900
- Tao Ling didn't tell you?
<i>- No.</i>

420
00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.200
What are you doing?

421
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.900
Hello? Zhou Xiao.

422
00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:00.400
I thought Cai Yasi told you. We're at the cafe on campus.

423
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.400
<i>Come here now. We're waiting for you.</i>

424
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.400
Okay, okay.

425
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.500
I'll be there right away. I was wrong.

426
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.200
Sorry, we have a high school classmate reunion today. I almost forgot.

427
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.400
They're all waiting for me. I'll get going. You guys keep eating.

428
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.200
Haven't you always hated eating carrots?

429
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.140
It's actually not that bad.

430
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:37.170
You used to not eat a bite of it. You'd give it all to me.

431
00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:42.800
But after that incident, you never gave them to me again.

432
00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.800
I was so sad for a long time because of that.

433
00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.200
Are you still mad at me?

434
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:55.200
That was nothing. You don't have to take it to heart.

435
00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.300
But after that incident, there seems to be a distance between us.

436
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000
You're thinking too much. I'd probably have forgotten about it if you hadn't mentioned it.

437
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.200
Really? I felt guilty for a long time.

438
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.120
Since you said that, I can put my mind at ease.

439
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.600
I have class in the afternoon. I'll get going now.

440
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.300
Remember to lock the door when you leave.

441
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.200
Okay.

442
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.400
Look. Isn't that the Cai Yasi who hacked the freshman speech?

443
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:37.600
I think so.

444
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:41.600
Let me tell you. He was the Chinese Division champion for the ACM Collegiate Programming Contest.

445
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.900
- How did you know? 
 - I asked someone about him.

446
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.400
Do you want to go up and talk to him?

447
00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.800
No, I'm too shy.

448
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.200
Baby, why did you just get here?

449
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.000
Sit here.

450
00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.400
Here we go again. I'm about to throw up.

451
00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.600
I'm begging you. Help me.

452
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.000
They must be blind for liking you.

453
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.400
Baby, what do you want to drink?

454
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.600
I want a caramel macchiato.

455
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.800
Okay, I'll get one for you right away.

456
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.800
Can you choose a cheaper one?

457
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.600
Then I'll break up with you.

458
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:21.400
Please, I was wrong.

459
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.000
Your wallet.

460
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Are you for real?

461
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.100
Give it to me.

462
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.100
Hurry up.

463
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.600
Xiao, I want one, too.

464
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.800
Me too.

465
00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.700
Sure, no problem. I'll get each of you one.

466
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200
Be careful.

467
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.000
Zhou Xiao, get back here!

468
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Cai Yasi! Cai Yasi!

469
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.300
- What? 
 - Let me ask you something. Get over here.

470
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.000
Hurry up.

471
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.800
Let me ask you. What do you think of Zhou Xiao?

472
00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:57.000
I think she's not great. She's a complete scammer.

473
00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.400
That's not what I'm talking about.

474
00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.400
I mean... how would she be as a girlfriend?

475
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.600
I'm planning to introduce a guy to her.

476
00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.400
What's the point of introducing someone to her? With Zhou Xiao,

477
00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.500
don't harm others.

478
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:18.600
You have such a severe reaction.

479
00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.600
You don't like her, do you?

480
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.100
Don't insult me like that!

481
00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.400
What?

482
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.600
Just a second ago, Cai Yasi...

483
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.800
No, no.

484
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:33.200
What really happened?

485
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.800
Nothing.

486
00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.000
What are your plans for the Detective Club?

487
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.800
Oh, I haven't told you guys yet.

488
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.600
The Student Association assigned a room for us. In the future, we can host all our events there.

489
00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.200
<i>Tao Ling, are you lying down again?</i>

490
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.400
Definitely not. I'm sitting down and memorizing English vocab words.

491
00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:55.800
Abandon. A-b-a-n-d-o-n. To give up.

492
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.800
<i>You only know this one.</i>

493
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.210
Okay, I promise you. I'll definitely go and study with you tomorrow.

494
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.400
I'm back!

495
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.600
What are you doing?

496
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.700
I'm designing our Detective Club event.

497
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.000
You've talked about this event so much.

498
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.200
When does it start?

499
00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.400
I've been organizing stuff for the Detective Club recently. I've finally finished.

500
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400
I'm announcing that the event officially starts.

501
00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.000
It'll be this Saturday, which is in two days.

502
00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:31.990
President, I want to invite a family member to the event.

503
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Okay.

504
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
If you all are bringing friends, then I will, too.

505
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.600
I'll bring Luo Wei. Xiao Lu, who are you bringing?

506
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.000
Let me think about it.

507
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.600
I can't go. There's a lecture I want to listen to on Saturday.

508
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.800
A lecture.

509
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.000
Then you will miss out on a fascinating detective game.

510
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Just keep bragging about it.

511
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.600
You don't believe it?

512
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.000
- Just wait. 
 - Let's go.

513
00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:01.000
The school issued our Student Association to help fix the appearance of the school.

514
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.400
During the meeting today, we're going to have to think of a plan.

515
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.600
Fanzhou, what do you think?

516
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.600
<i>Why is she here?</i>

517
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:13.210
Were you listening to me?

518
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.000
I got it. We'll have a meeting later.

519
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.300
It's me again.

520
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.200
Zhao Fanzhou isn't here.

521
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.600
That's okay. I'm here to see you.

522
00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.400
Me?

523
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.600
I just finished setting everything up here. I have cups but don't have water so...

524
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.300
That's okay.

525
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.000
I know you must be surprised that I came to find you like this.

526
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.800
But since it's for Fanzhou, I had to suck it up and come talk to you.

527
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.400
Did you misunderstand? He and I are just friends.

528
00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:51.400
Recently, we've been interacting more, but it's just because of the Detective Club.

529
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.200
I'm sorry.

530
00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.300
I didn't misunderstand.

531
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.600
I know Fanzhou genuinely sees you as a friend.

532
00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.800
He doesn't have many friends,

533
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.600
so when I see you guys hanging out,

534
00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.000
it makes me happy, too. Thank you.

535
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.800
You-You're welcome.

536
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.400
Actually, I know it looks like he is distant with me right now,

537
00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:19.300
but we grew up together. We were as close as real brother and sister.

538
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.900
If it wasn't for...

539
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:28.900
<i>Fanzhou, I want to go see Cheer Chen's concert.</i>

540
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.200
<i>Can you come with me?</i>

541
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.600
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

542
00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600
<i>Please.</i>

543
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.200
<i>What are you doing instead of going home after school?</i>

544
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.890
<i>- Auntie. 
 - Mom.</i>

545
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.600
<i>Fanzhou, Yichun doesn't understand,</i>

546
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.400
<i>but you should know better. You know your mom's temper.</i>

547
00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.800
<i>If she were to see this, she'd get upset again.</i>

548
00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.000
<i>Mom.</i>

549
00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.200
<i>What? Did I say something wrong?</i>

550
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.800
<i>Last time, when his mom threw a tantrum in the elevator, you saw it, too.</i>

551
00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.200
<i>Aren't you scared? You should stay away from their family.</i>

552
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.000
<i>Auntie, I'll leave now.</i>

553
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.470
<i>Come back. Wait here.</i>

554
00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.010
<i>If it wasn't for my mom,</i>

555
00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.200
maybe our ten years of friendship would have taken a step further by now.

556
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.600
Why are you telling me this?

557
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.400
It has nothing to do with me if your relationship goes further.

558
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.800
I don't have any other intentions—

559
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.400
I'm not concerned about what you mean.

560
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:34.200
It's just that this is between you and Zhao Fanzhou. It really has nothing to do with me.

561
00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.400
You—

562
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.800
Also, there's one thing I need to correct you on.

563
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:43.600
This is clearly your problem. Why are you blaming your mom?

564
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.200
Your mom attacked Zhao Fanzhou,

565
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.000
<i>so as his friend, you should've stepped up and defended him.</i>

566
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.000
<i>Is there anything else? If not, you should leave.</i>

567
00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
I have a lot left to do here.

571
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.200
Classmate, what are you doing here?

572
00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.700
Hello Professor.

573
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:48.700
You're Zhao Fanzhou's friend who came to listen in on my class, right?

574
00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.400
Yes.

575
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.300
What are you doing here?

576
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.300
- Are you looking for Zhao Fanzhou?  
  - It's not that.

577
00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:02.000
I came to experience the atmosphere of the forensic science lab. It might help my writing.

578
00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.800
What are you writing?

579
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.400
Last time, you said you were looking for inspiration.

580
00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:10.000
Are you writing about forensic science?

581
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.400
Yes. My main character is a forensic scientist.

582
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.800
So I need to understand forensic science more, right?

583
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.900
That's a good choice for a main character.

584
00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.600
A lot of people are prejudiced against forensic science.

585
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:28.600
In web novels, the forensic scientist characters are all twisted and bloodthirsty.

586
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.600
You need to help restore a positive image of forensic science.

587
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.000
No problem.

588
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.600
Professor, do you also read web novels?

589
00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.200
Have you read the one I'm writing?

590
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.600
It's called "Two-Faced Person: Bloodthirsty Forensic Scientist."

591
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600
I'll show you.

592
00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.400
This...

I'm so honored, really.

596
00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:02.800
Your... Your writing is pretty interesting.

597
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.400
Then, Professor, can you show me around your lab?

598
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400
Let me think about it.

599
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.200
No.

600
00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.200
Why?

601
00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.400
Because you also depict forensic scientists as twisted and bloodthirsty.

602
00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:22.000
Professor, let me explain.

603
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Professor, the book's name is <i> Two-Faced Person. </i> The other side hasn't appeared yet.

604
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.400
What should I do? This is my last clue.

605
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:41.800
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

606
00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:44.800
Don't shrug your shoulders!

607
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.400
Which one do you want?

608
00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.500
This one. Thanks.

609
00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:01.900
I'll open it for you.

610
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.600
- Here.  
  - Thank you

611
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.100
You're welcome.

612
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.400
Nice shot!

613
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.500
Do you have time tomorrow?

614
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.400
What's up?

615
00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.000
I want to invite you to our Detective Club event.

616
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.400
The event rules say that everyone has to bring a friend.

617
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.400
Okay.

618
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.000
Really?

619
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.400
- Thank you. 
 - You're welcome.

620
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.870
Let's continue.

621
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.600
Use some more effort.

622
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.700
Beautiful.

623
00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.100
Why is Zhou Xiao still not here?

624
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.400
She should be here soon.

625
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.800
I kept you guys waiting for too long.

626
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.600
You even knew to come?

627
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.600
Am I the club president or are you the club president?

628
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.300
Of course... it's not me,

629
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.000
Okay, everyone, quiet down.

630
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.600
I'm going to announce our groups now.

631
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:26.000
Fang Wei and Tao Ling are a group.

632
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.600
Xiao Lu...

633
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:30.000
- He'll be here soon. 
- Okay.

634
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.400
You'll be a group with Chen Yu.

635
00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.900
Cai Yasi and Zhao Fanzhou are a group.

636
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.400
I don't want to be in a group with him!

637
00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.600
He's going to slow me down. I have plans to play video games later.

638
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.400
I'll tell you right now, you can't. This was already decided.

639
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.000
Then, can I be in a group by myself?

640
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.900
Do you still want to play?

641
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.100
<i>Hello.</i>

642
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.000
What are you doing here?

643
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.800
Chen Yu has a stomachache. He asked me to take his place.

644
00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.400
Club President, I want to switch. I don't want to be in a group with him.

645
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.000
I want to switch, too.

646
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.600
Why should we switch just because you guys want to? I don't want to switch.

647
00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.400
Why should we not switch just because you don't want to?

648
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.600
- I'm switching. 
 - I won't.

649
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.900
- I'm switching. 
 - I won't.

650
00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.600
- I'm switching. 
 - I won't.

651
00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.800
Zhou Xiao.

652
00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.000
- Club President, be fair. 
 - Let's switch.

653
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.600
Stop.

654
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.000
Xiao, it's too dark. I'm scared.

655
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.800
Don't be scared. It'll be over soon.

656
00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.600
Can we hurry up? I'm getting impatient.

657
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:31.400
Shut up and put on your eye mask.

658
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.400
Classmate Zhu Lu, are you here? Classmate Zhu Lu.

659
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:37.500
- I'm not here. 
 - Be quiet.

660
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.310
Classmates, the game will begin soon.

661
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.700
Please prepare yourselves.

662
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.400
I hope you guys pass each level smoothly.

663
00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.800
Give me the key, the key!

664
00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.600
What's wrong with you? What are you doing?

665
00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.200
I knew you were going to do this. Anyway, I'm out now.

666
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.800
Hurry up!  Give me the clue for the next level.

667
00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.200
I'm in a hurry to go play games.

668
00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.000
If you don't want to do this, you don't have to.

669
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.400
Are you really angry?

670
00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:50.000
Okay, I won't mess around. I'll go back inside now and listen to the club president. Okay?

671
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.800
Just go play your video games. I don't want to see you.

672
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.800
Really?

673
00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.600
Go, go, go.

674
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.600
<i>[Preview]
The game officially starts now.</i>

675

<i>Either you're really smart, or you really understand Zhou Xiao.</i>

676
00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.600
<i>Shi Guoguo, can I switch seats with you?</i>

677
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.400
<i>Xiao Lu specifically emphasized that you shouldn't go.</i>

678
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.700
<i>If she doesn't want me to go, I have to go.</i>

679
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:27.400
