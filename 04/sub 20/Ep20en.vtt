00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.590
<i> ♫ Close your eyes. I am so, so, so captivated by you like this ♫ </i>

2
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.190
<i> ♫ You fell into my colorful dream from last night ♫ </i>

3
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.320
<i>♫ I want to work hard to gain your attention ♫</i>

4
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.660
<i> ♫ Laying in your embrace ♫</i>

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.660
<i> ♫ Listening to the sounds of rain outside the window ♫</i>

6
00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.840
<i>♫ I can speak first ♫</i>

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.130
<i> ♫ I want to accompany you to go catch the wind ♫</i>

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:39.060
<i> ♫ Daydreaming together, a dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.460
<i>♫ A dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

10
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.230
<i> ♫ Just want to wait until the rain falls first, 
slowly making your hair wet ♫</i>

11
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.070
<i>♫ I seem to have used some kind of magic ♫</i>

12
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.920
<i>♫ Even a frozen river can melt ♫</i>

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.820
<i> ♫ Is it like Zhuang Zhou's dream of becoming a butterfly? ♫</i>

14
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.900
<i>♫ You are a blessing and a blight ♫</i>

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.940
<i>♫ Then just accept it, accompanying you in 
a peaceful and clear night ♫</i>

16
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.820
<i> ♫ Listening to the temple's monk ringing the bell ♫</i>

17
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.460
<i> ♫ Laying at the Mount Nan loft relaxing ♫</i>

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830
<i>♫ For you I hid my tears ♫</i>

19
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.800
<i>♫ Abandoned worldly affairs. I will find you 
no matter the time and place ♫</i>

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.510
<i>♫ It's you for the rest of my life. I want to be closer to you ♫</i>

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.010
<i>♫ Meeting you in the mortal world ♫</i>

22
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.890
<i>♫ Meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.560
<i>♫ Meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.070
<i>♫ Meeting you, meeting you, meeting you ♫</i>

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.290
<i>♫ Listening to the sounds of rain outside the window ♫</i>

26
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.390
<i>♫ I can speak first ♫</i>

27
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.660
<i>♫ I want to accompany you to go catch the wind ♫</i>

28
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.490
<i>♫ Daydreaming together, a dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i>

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.050
<i> ♫ A dream we cannot wake up from ♫</i> 
<i> [Love Is All] </i>

30
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.420
<i> [Love Is All] </i>

31
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.290
<i>[Episode 20- Zheng Shaofeng revealed a secret to Ruyi, Tang Tianyuan gets together with Tan Lingyin]</i>

32
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.160
The people of the county magistrate's manor are really out of the ordinary. Even the servant girl is so beautiful.

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.990
How old are you? You don't have an engagement, right?

34
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.830
I'm already engaged to the Tang family. I just haven't gotten married yet.

35
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.610
It's fine if you haven't gotten married yet.

36
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.520
The Tang family?

37
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.340
So it turns out that you are Madame Sister-in-Law. I apologize for the disrespect.

38
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.940
Wait, that's not right... Aren't you—

39
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.960
If you have nothing of importance, leave for now.

40
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.430
He has to treat me.

41
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.470
Okay. Then I'll be outside waiting.

42
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.880
Tell me if you need anything.


44
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.930
Continue.

45
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.580
You're a bastard.

46
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.890
What do you plan on doing with Tan Lingyin?

47
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.950
Speak.

48
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.520
Why do all the good girls like you? They're must all be blind.

49
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.060
But you can't be careless about this wound of yours. The strychnine nut poison isn't that easy to clear.

50
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.600
You need to have proper rest.

51
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.090
Oh right! Do you know where Old Tie is?

52
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.320
Wasn't it because you broke through the bandit stronghold and let him run away?

53
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.200
But don't worry, I can find him.

54
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.440
If I find him, I'll advise him to follow after you.

55
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.400
What's your relationship with Tan Lingyin?

56
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.890
We've become sworn brothers! We're brothers that would even die for each other.

57
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.990
I, Duan Feng, am a man of the pugilistic world.

58
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.960
I am free and easy.

59
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.950
You better be.

60
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.510
But...

61
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.550
if an accident happens to you

62
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.130
or you purposefully yield,

63
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.020
Brother, I won't hesitate. I will definitely,

64
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.700
carefully take care of the two madame sisters-in-law for you.

65
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.230
There are step marks here.

66
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.510
Looking at these here, it should have been these two days.

67
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.200
If Constable Zheng's not feeling well, you can go back.

68
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.700
It is fine if I investigate on my own.

69
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.010
Can you tell me, does Miss Ruyi know qinggong? <i>(T/N: qinggong is a type of martial art skill  where people are light on their feet and can jump over walls)</i>

70
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.000
My cousin has been weak since she was very young.

71
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.950
She most likely doesn't know qinggong.

72
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.410
But that day in the county office, I seemed to have seen a trace of her.

73
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.290
You must have seen wrong. Why would she go there?

74
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.200
Perhaps.

75
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.070
did something happen to her?

76
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.000
Nothing much.

77
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.890
Sometimes,

78
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.900
I really want to take these cases and conspiracies of the county office

79
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.200
and throw them all away.

80
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.860
I just want to concentrate on loving one person.

81
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.190
If you do this, you would perhaps be letting down Sir Tang.

82
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.670
I've thought it through. I don't want to work on this job anymore.

83
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.240
After this gold case is concluded, I will resign.

84
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.090
I will pay the ransom for Miss Ruyi and live the life of an ordinary person.

85
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.540
But after you resign, what money will you use to pay a ransom?

86
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.650
I can go to the military and be a military person.

87
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.260
Or I can push a cart and sell sweet potatoes.

88
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.800
As long as I can make money, I'll do anything.

89
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.960
Every day that I am in the county office, Miss Ruyi will have ill-feelings toward me.

90
00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.320
Even if you resign, she might not be willing.

91
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.790
But I still have to try.

92
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.490
For her, things I should and shouldn't sacrifice,

93
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.880
I can sacrifice them all.

94
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.300
Can even brothers be sacrificed?

95
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.440
Sir Tang is so proficient. If anyone is sacrificing someone, he would be the one sacrificing me.

96
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.910
Why must you choose her?

97
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.290
In Tongling County, there are plenty of women from good families.

98
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:13.950
I only want Zhou Ruyi.

99
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.220
You should say these words to her.

100
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.890
<i> ♫ Only when you come here boundless ♫</i>

101
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.560
<i> ♫ Can you drink till drunk ♫</i>

102
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.920
Let go!

103
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.250
Right now, I've said these words to her.

104
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.430
<i> ♫ Freely pick a song ♫</i>

105
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.640
If you want to do it, then do it.

106
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.110
<i> ♫  The swaying shadows from the candle and 
longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

107
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.170
Before, I thought you were like a woman, wasting time and dawdling.

108
00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:01.250
Thinking about it right now, there really is such a justification.

109
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.710
It's fine if you don't kill me. Hurry and leave.

110
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.030
I'm going to stay here until daybreak before going back.

111
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:10.220
That time is enough for you to reach Chizhou.

112
00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.370
Before, whenever I faced Miss Ruyi, I had a set pattern of behavior.

113
00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:18.040
When I faced Zhou Zhengdao, I had another set.

114
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.330
Now, I really don't know how to face you.

115
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.470
I don't have any regrets if I die by your hands.

116
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.870
<i> ♫  The swaying shadows from the candle and 
longings are still the same as that year’s ♫</i>

117
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.600
<i> ♫ Who is lamenting under the moon? ♫</i>

118
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.170
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

119
00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:01.020
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

120
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.620
After I succeeded in persuading Duan Feng,

121
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.100
I was then faced with another significant and difficult problem.

122
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.410
That is!

123
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.210
How to, under everyone's watchful eyes,

124
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.510
let Duan Feng and Tang Tianyuan meet privately.

125
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.310
Thank goodness I'm quick-witted and smart.

126
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.850
I put Duan Feng in makeup and clothes to disguise him as a shaman.

127
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.400
Not one person in the county office noticed.

128
00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.670
Then what?

129
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.800
- And then I just charged in. Guess what Master Tang did. 
 - What did he do?

130
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.850
His two eyes turned pitch black and his whole body festered.

131
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.800
He was already on the verge of death.

132
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.260
Then based on what you're saying, I'm a ghost that's come back to life now?

133
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.690
When did you come?

134
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.710
Come with me.

135
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.780
Sister Lingyin, you haven't finished your story.

136
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.550
Qingchen, help me retell it to them.

137
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.640
Does it taste good?

138
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.870
Let's play this.

139
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.070
Oh, I was so close.

140
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.840
Give me your hand.

141
00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:17.540
So amazing. So amazing.

142
00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.010
You got the gold.

143
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:20.520
You two have such good fortune.

144
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.240
Thank you.

145
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.780
Gold.

146
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.940
I never knew you were so good at ring toss. How about we go and play some more?

147
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.750
Let's go win some more gold.

148
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.920
It's hard to run a small business. Do you want to reduce him to poverty and ruin?

149
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.410
You must be willing to accept the loss if you want to run a business.

150
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.740
I bought you here tonight not just to see the hustle and bustle,

151
00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.080
there's a big use for this gold.

152
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.750
It's already so late, why are all the girls heading to the Temple of the Old Man of the Moon? 
 <i>(T/N: Old Man of the Moon is the God of Marriage)</i>

153
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.630
- Let's go look, too. 
 - All right.

154
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.260
Let's go.

155
00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.430
Uncle.

156
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.900
Miss, toss this jade pan. Write on it your name and the young master's name.

157
00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.020
Hang it on the matchmaker tree at the entrance of the temple.

158
00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.430
I guarantee the lovers will live happily ever after.

159
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.610
How much for one?

160
00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:00.290
Not expensive. One silver tael for one.

161
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:04.540
One silver tael for one? Let's go. This is a complete scam.

162
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.990
Wait a second. Aren't your graphic novels all about devout men and women

163
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.170
who seal their marriage fate with each other under the matchmaker tree?

164
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.570
I've realized from being with you that all of those are useless.

165
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.440
Only they would fall for it. We're different. We're already like this.

166
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.460
That's right! I think I left my fan back there. I'll go get it.

167
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.000
All right.

168
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.400
Young Master.

169
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.070
Tang Tianyuan. Tan Lingyin.

170
00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.570
All right.

171
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.680
<i>[Tang Tianyuan. Tan Lingyin.]</i>

172
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.400
<i>There is already so much poor quality gold in the market.</i>

173
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.270
<i>- You have such a big appetite, Adviser. 
- So amazing.</i>

174
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.790
<i>Come!</i>

175
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.710
<i>How can she eat so much?</i>

176
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.330
<i>She eats really well.</i>

177
00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:03.670
<i>She really can eat.</i>

178
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.970
Okay, the joss stick has finished burning. Adviser Tan wins.

179
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.920
Tonight's food is free of charge and you win a complimentary tray of steamed buns.

180
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.950
Thank you. Many thanks.

181
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.510
Didn't I tell you to go back first?

182
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.140
What are you doing here?

183
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.920
What's there to do at the county office? There are free midnight snacks here.

184
00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.100
Eat.

185
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:27.630
Come back with me.

186
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:30.350
Let me finish eating.

187
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.860
Eat.

188
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.400
I normally see you jumping and skipping about in the county office.

189
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.020
Why are you outside all the time nowadays.

190
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.100
Is it because there's an additional person in the county office?

191
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.660
Who said that?

192
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:49.070
The county office is my home. What's wrong with having a visitor?

193
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:53.160
So hospitable. How about I ask her to stay?

194
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.710
Hey!

195
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.810
Okay, I'll stop joking. I know you've been upset lately.

196
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:07.020
But you want to keep your image as the adviser,

197
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.650
That's why it can be said that you're pretending to be magnanimous.

198
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:13.260
But in your heart, you keep comparing yourself with her in every aspect.

199
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:15.850
But what can I do?

200
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.130
Miss Jiang has had an engagement with you since before.

201
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.420
Furthermore, she's educated and well-balanced. Me?

202
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.530
No matter how I look, I am from a small family;

203
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.910
a charming fox that seduces people that doesn't know how high the heavens are and how thick the earth is.

204
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:28.590
You are a charming fox that can eat three trays of buns in one meal.

205
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:31.000
You're the first I've seen.

206
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.640
Either way, I'm a normal woman with nobody to rely on.

207
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.940
Wordless and uncommunicative, lacking authority and power.

208
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.490
I think you're just undisciplined.

209
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.590
Tan Lingyin, I'm telling you.

210
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.660
I want to marry you.

211
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.720
as my only wife.

212
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.490
What about Jiang Muchun?

213
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.000
Give me some time. I'll resolve everything.

214
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:11.270
Really?

215
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:15.240
Then, will you be with me forever and never lie to me?

216
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.850
♫<i> The rain falls in the forest and disturbs

223
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.170
It's getting cold. You should wear more.

224
00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.040
You're drinking and didn't even invite me.

225
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.930
Weren't you going to patrol the streets?

226
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.200
What's there to patrol? Tongling is so quiet.

227
00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.890
Patrol for what?

228
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:51.850
I think the most dangerous place is our office.

229
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:58.190
Don't be like this. What if people see?

230
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.870
I'm not like Old Tang.

231
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.130
I don't want to act. I also don't know how to act.

232
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.930
Ruyi, maybe this time...

233
00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.460
I can't help you hide it anymore.

234
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.460
You've never needed to help me hide it.

235
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.360
I will tell Sir Tang everything.

236
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.770
I just need some time.

237
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.730
Zong Yinglin raised me for 18 years after all.

238
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.220
I know.

239
00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:37.770
I believe you.

240
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.620
But there's still a master behind Zong Yinglin.

241
00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.370
Do you know?

242
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.100
This gold case is really interesting.

243
00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.030
It's really giving me a headache.

244
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.630
Have a look. Freshly baked sweet potatoes!

245
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:08.830
Fragrant and sweet. Soft and sticky. Ten copper coins for half a kilogram!

246
00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.130
- Hey! 
 - Hello, Ma'am!

247
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.860
Your sweet potatoes are too expensive. Who are you trying to cheat?

248
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.660
Aunt, then how much should half a kilogram sell for?
 <i>[Baked sweet potatoes]</i>

249
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.830
Just this.

250
00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.870
Five copper coins for half a kilogram? Deal.

251
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:25.860
No. Ten copper coins for two-and-a-half kilograms. The west and north ends of the city are all selling at this price.

252
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.100
Ten copper coins for two-and-a-half kilograms? Deal.

253
00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.420
- Auntie. 
 - Okay, give me five kilograms.

254
00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.960
You can't.

255
00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.040
Ruyi.

256
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.760
Auntie, you bullying him too much. Sourcing half a kilogram already costs three copper coins.

257
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.230
Plus, the cost to roast them. Buying them for five copper coins is not too much.

258
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:42.690
You're bullying him for not knowing things.

259
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.930
Is the time and energy he spent not worth anything?

260
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.660
Young man, here's the money.

261
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.730
- Auntie's place isn't far from here, just four streets away. 
 - One...

262
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:51.360
Please deliver it to me later.

263
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.350
I'm sorry, he's not selling anymore. Here.

264
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.230
What- What's the problem with you?

265
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:59.180
I'm the person buying and he's the person selling. Do you have a right to speak here?

266
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.700
Why not? I'm the one who keeps track of finances.

267
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.190
If I say we're not selling, then we're not.

268
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:08.230
Your wife is so unreasonable. You already agreed to sell it to me.

269
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.420
Going back on your word.

270
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.540
Wife?

271
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.740
My husband has been selling these since early morning and has to work all day long. Why should he have to put up with your anger?

272
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.130
Ten copper coins for half a kilogram, will you buy it? If not, we'll keep it an eat it ourselves.

273
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.440
Young man, you should control her more.

274
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Stupid. Why aren't you staying at the county office? What are you doing here?

275
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.840
You're even laughing!

276
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.620
If my wife won't let me laugh, I won't.

277
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.410
If I didn't say that, she would keep bothering you for a long time.

278
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.090
What are you thinking every day?

279
00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.250
Didn't I already promise you? I'll resign as soon as the gold case is finished.

280
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.040
I will be by your side forever.

281
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.360
I'll see what the natural conditions and social customs are like.

282
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.420
I'll see whether I can support you by selling sweet potatoes.

283
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.200
Then, how much did you make today?

284
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.040
20 Copper Coins.

285
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.420
But...

286
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.730
I spent one silver tael on this hoe to dig sweet potatoes.

287
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.270
You dug them yourself? Other people's sweet potatoes?

288
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:16.870
No. I'll show you. Let's go.

289
00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.540
Then— This—

290
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:36.310
You... Why did you bring me here?

291
00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:39.650
If I tell you, then don't blame me for being stupid.

292
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:42.950
Then you have to first say what you want to do.

293
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.470
I saved up a lot of money because of you.

294
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.230
I bought this land.

295
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.060
Look! I'm going to grow a fruit tree there.

296
00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.000
And put a grape lattice over there.

297
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.280
When it's summer next year, we can eat the grapes.

298
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.090
Also, I dug the sweet potatoes over there.

299
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.800
I dug the sweet potatoes from this morning from there.

300
00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.000
Then, what's this wood for?

301
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.070
This? This...

302
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.900
This is you and I?

303
00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.590
That's right. Look.

304
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.930
Mount Tianmu's fairy

305
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.670
and the little old man who sells sweet potatoes. Isn't it like this?

306
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:33.950
But I still haven't told Sir Tang.

307
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:36.140
I believe you.

308
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.210
Today, let's not talk about this.

309
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.160
Let's talk about the future.

310
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.940
Look.

311
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.700
This is the front yard.

312
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.550
We'll put a swing here.

313
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:54.040
On the left is the bedroom. I'll choose the biggest one.

314
00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:56.840
On the left side is the bedroom of our children.

315
00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.260
Let's work hard together and have many children.

316
00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.740
Then I'll build a second floor and we can live upstairs.

317
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.590
The kids can live downstairs.

318
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:07.530
We can watch them through the window.

319
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.350
Ruyi, do you want a boy or a girl?

320
00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.070
How about we have a pair?

321
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.100
What are you saying?

322
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.280
You don't know any embarrassment.

323
00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.670
Ruyi, just tell me if you need to buy anything else.

324
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.170
How about we plant peach blossom trees?

325
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.580
All of Adviser's novels have peach blossoms in them.

326
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.730
- And then when the blossoms bloom... 
- Tell the blossoms they don't need to bloom. 
 <i>(T/N: Peach blossoms blooming suggest that you've found the one.)</i>

327
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:40.440
The person I'm waiting for is already here.

328
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.030
<i> ♫ Half of a wooden home door is open ♫</i>

329
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:50.490
<i> ♫ I sober up in my hometown ♫</i>

330
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.680
<i> ♫ Listen to the wind ♫</i>

331
00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:01.860
<i> ♫ Accompanied by pear blossoms, I drink until drunk  ♫</i>

332
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.270
<i> ♫ And another cup ♫</i>

333
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.340
- What's wrong? 
 - Sir.

334
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.130
Sir Zong.

335
00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.460
So you know to call me "Sir."

336
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.830
If not for Jiang Muchun's arrival to Tongling,

337
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.440
to this day I might still be muddled by your words.

338
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.890
I came with a royal order, so I did not mean to intentionally hide it from you.

339
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.480
For me to come today is because I have important things to discuss with you.

340
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.030
There is a lot of poor quality gold being used in the marketplace.

341
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.180
Your information is always fast. You must know.

342
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.680
Have you obtained evidence?

343
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.620
I haven't. It's just that here,

344
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.190
how is there so much poor gold?

345
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.840
It shouldn't be hard for me to trace it and find the answer.

346
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:33.790
Sir, do you have the confidence in finding evidence

347
00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.860
to prove that I'm guilty?

348
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.670
Of course.

349
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.490
You know my identity.

350
00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.910
I'm giving you one last chance.

351
00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.530
To help me find the gold and catch the real perpetrator.

352
00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:59.890
I will definitely say some good words in front of the emperor

353
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.050
and promise your safety.

354
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:07.720
See the situation clearly. Repent and be saved.

355
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:15.460
Let me think about it.

356
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:20.470
There isn't a lot of time left.

357
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.680
I'll wait for you.

358
00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.350
Let's go.

359
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:28.900
Sir, are we still going to Tonglin?

360
00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:37.830
This person speaks with good reason.

361
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.620
Send news to Ruyi. Have her come see me.

362
00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:45.170
But it's been a long time since Miss Ruyi responded to my news.

363
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.790
Just tell her I'm sick.

364
00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.710
There aren't many days left.

365
00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.270
Yes.

366
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.510
Godfather, she cannot be relied on anymore.

367
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:00.380
Why are you here?

368
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.760
Instead of relying on a woman,

369
00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:04.780
why don't you let me try?

370
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.020
Maybe I can find a way out.

371
00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.600
I told you to hide well. You can't act until the last moment.

372
00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.980
Now is the last moment.

373
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:25.220
All right.

374
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.130
Do what you must.

375
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.680
I understand.

376
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:41.080
Wife.

377
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.810
Brother Shun, don't you have to patrol?

378
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:53.800
I've been walking around so much at night, I'm feeling a little bit unsettled.

379
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.170
I'm here to ask for a bowl of wine.

380
00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:00.490
I couldn't tell. You seem like someone who is so brave.

381
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:02.260
Are you afraid of the dark?

382
00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:06.880
- Kid, you. 
 - I'm just joking, just joking.

383
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.800
The boss is asleep. I secretly added a couple of more side dishes for you.

384
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.030
That's all right.

385
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:25.860
Try and persuade your boss,

386
00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.480
tell him not to be so persistent.

387
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:31.490
I do try to persuade him normally.

388
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.130
But our boss,

389
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.670
he has a one-track mind.

390
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:40.570
He keeps talking about the three-month deadline.

391
00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.180
He insists on waiting for Adviser Tan to finish serving her duty,

392
00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:46.320
then he will pursue her again.

393
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.030
Say, Adviser Tan has long made up her mind.

394
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.240
Even if the three-month deadline is up, what's the point?

395
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.710
Wouldn't she still choose Sir Tang?

396
00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.330
The three-month deadline you speak of...

397
00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.660
If I remember correctly, it should be these few days.

398
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.560
Is it?

399
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.610
I'm telling you. Even though our boss looks like a self-indulgent son of rich parents,

400
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.700
actually he treats us, servants,

401
00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:19.220
pretty good.

402
00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:22.560
He always says "I'm poor, I'm poor."

403
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.050
But he never leaves out even a cent of our wages.

404
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.920
And he often gives us tips. I always tell him don't be so one-track minded on this one marriage.

405
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:31.540
But he doesn't listen.

406
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.940
He keeps insisting on this... having hope!

407
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.390
This Boss Zhu is too kind.

408
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.020
If he were someone who was more ruthless,

409
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:46.040
Adviser Tan and Sir Tang would long be unable to be together.

410
00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.490
What do you mean?

411
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:52.510
You didn't know?

412
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.510
Like Adviser Tan, she clearly already has an engagement,

413
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.750
but she's in a public relationship with Master Tang.

414
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.720
Do you know what it is called under our laws?

415
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:11.150
Why would I go and analyze laws for no reason?

416
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:21.630
This is called committing adultery.

417
00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:26.080
The person who committed the crime will be caned severely and sent away,

418
00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.700
plus for someone of Sir Tang's position,

419
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.880
that's called knowing the law yet still breaking it. He would lose his position!

420
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:37.140
- There's such a thing? 
 - Yes.

421
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:43.540
I'm just saying, don't take it too seriously.

422
00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:56.600
Boss, rest assured.

423
00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.470
I know how to repay kindness properly.

424
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.950
I will help you get your wish.

425
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.270
<i>[Morality]</i>

426
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.930
Er Tong.

427
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.960
Where are you bringing me?

428
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.440
You wake me up so early in the morning and bring me out here on the street.

429
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.990
I still have a hangover from last night.

430
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:37.780
- Boss. 
 - Yes.

431
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.310
Today is the day I pay you back.

432
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.200
The situations you can't think of, I'll give you an idea.

433
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.320
Today, I'll let you fulfill your long-cherished wish.

434
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.780
Is it possible that you can make my wife change her mind?

435
00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.600
Wait and see what happens today.

436
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.100
Don't hit it, don't hit it.

437
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.110
You're crazy, right?

438
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.180
Enough, enough.

439
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.880
Hello, Officers.

440
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:14.880
It's you again. What are you doing?

441
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.560
Today, I will report

442
00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.570
a county magistrate that knew the law and still broke it!

443
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.630
- Er Tong. 
 - This little brat.

444
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:24.190
Who wants to sue the county office?

445
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.390
It's a misunderstanding.

446
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.870
Master Zong, I will withdraw my accusation right away.

447
00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.900
Our kid doesn't know stuff. We'll be leaving now.

448
00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.260
We'll be on our way now Master Zong.

449
00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.390
- Take care. 
 - Wait a moment.

450
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:56.930
Zhu Dacong,

451
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.420
you disrupted the order of the court.

452
00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.520
You framed a government official. You should be punished.

453
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.530
Hit him 50 times.

454
00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.610
50 is too much, 10.

455
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:12.230
How could you still be negotiating at this time?

456
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.370
Discipline him first, then lock him up in prison.

457
00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.070
Yes, sir.

458
00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:21.070
Boss! Boss!

459
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:22.910
Wait!

460
00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.560
You detain my person?

461
00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.650
My dad is the magistrate of Jinan.

462
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.380
You touch my people, have you asked him?

463
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.020
Just let Master Zong pass a verdict.

464
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.400
In any case, there is neither witness testimony nor material evidence for this matter.

465
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.960
It all depends on the person implicated opening their mouth. Sir Tang will act according to the situation.

466
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.950
Then, continue your trial. I want to see...

467
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.860
what kind of trick judgment you can come up with!

468
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.600
Both of you, the master and servant, are showing contempt of the court. How brave!

469
00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.410
Guards, block their mouths.

470
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.120
Yes, Sir.

471
00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:56.790
Are you two the constables of Tongling County Zhao Xiaoliu,

472
00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:59.680
- Li Dawang. 
 - As you said, Sir.

473
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:03.640
I have a question to ask. Answer me with the facts.

474
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.320
Tang Feilong, Sir Tang

475
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:09.910
and Adviser, Tan Lingyin.

476
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.360
Are they...

477
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.380
In an ambiguous relationship?

478
00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.410
Have they pledged to marry already?

479
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.060
Yes or no?

480
00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.810
- No. 
 - No.

481
00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.720
But I hear...

482
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.960
the civilians of Tongling County saying

483
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.130
Tongling's County Magistrate and Adviser

484
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.730
will become a family soon.

485
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.080
Master Zong, there are things you are unaware of.

486
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.130
The civilians of Tongling live and work peacefully and happily.

487
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.550
They love to crack and eat melon seeds,

488
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:49.380
and gossip. This can't be counted on.

489
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.320
Right. Our Sir is elegant and unrestrained.

490
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.330
Our adviser is talented and beautiful.

491
00:31:57.330 --> 00:32:00.870
Moreover, when two people's ages are similar, it is very easy for others to misunderstand—

492
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.920
Sir Zong, if you want to punish me for a crime, there is no need to be surreptitious.

493
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.990
There's no need to take my status into consideration.

494
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:10.120
There is no harm in saying what you think.

495
00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:14.840
Sir Tang, can you report the actual situation?

496
00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.480
How are you planning on judging me?

497
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.250
If according to the law,

498
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.120
the judgment should be that adultery was committed.

499
00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:28.770
The woman... acted contrary to morality...

500
00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:35.190
You old man, my wife did not act contrary to morality.

501
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:38.380
If she committed adultery, I, as her husband, would know. I know the law, too.

502
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.170
I'm retracting my allegations, okay?

503
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.590
If we don't investigate this thoroughly,

504
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.820
what if this kind of

505
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.200
adulterous behavior

506
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:49.780
gets set as a bad example?

507
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:55.020
Sir Tang, you should follow my lead.

508
00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:00.520
Tongling would be in big trouble.

509
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.780
However, Zhu Dacong put framing allegations against a court official,

510
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.760
this much is true.

511
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.620
Exiled two thousand <i>li</i> away  (around 1000 km).

512
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.680
- Take them away. 
 - Wait.

513
00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:19.110
Sir Tang, you still have something to say?

514
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.410
Master Zhu is right.

515
00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.140
Adviser Tan and I

516
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.830
have fallen in love and vowed to spend the rest of our lives together.

517
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:32.830
Tang Feilong, even a man can't even withstand 100 strokes,

518
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.350
moreover a fragile woman like my wife!

519
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.610
You-You can't do this!

520
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.250
That's right.

521
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.270
The conclusion is adultery.

522
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.670
As it's committed by an official, it is even more severe.

523
00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:50.700
Sir Zong,

524
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.600
I didn't even want to come to this small county to be a magistrate.

525
00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.090
But I had no choice because I respect the emperor's orders.

526
00:33:57.090 --> 00:33:59.670
The duties here are also boring.

527
00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:04.030
Suddenly, we got a woman adviser knocking on our door!

528
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.740
You and I are both men.

529
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.030
If you were in my shoes, would you want her?

530
00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.300
That is indeed reasonable.

531
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.370
So once my assignment is over,

532
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.540
I'll give Master Zhu's wife back to him.

533
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.860
Tang Feilong!

534
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.540
You are crazy!

535
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.870
You're not willing?

536
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.490
I-I-

537
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.270
I am willing.

538
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:38.770
But how could you be this kind of person?

539
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:42.580
My wife was so good to you!

540
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.640
How can you treat her like this?

541
00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:48.700
You!

542
00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:50.980
- Zhu Dacong! 
 - Boss!

543
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:54.710
Tang Tianyuan, what are you saying?

544
00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.420
Tan Lingyin, I've already helped you enough.

545
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.580
If you don't want to marry him then I'll help you.

546
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.830
But you can't obstruct my career advancement.

547
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.270
You had too much fun acting?

548
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.390
It's an act. She's putting on an act.

549
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.220
She doesn't want to marry Zhu Dacong, I helped to shield her.

550
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.700
- Isn't this putting on an act? 
 - Master Tang,

551
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.640
you can't spew nonsense just to protect her.

552
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.900
You've probably heard since you're from the capital.

553
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:34.170
The assistant minister's daughter has long had an engagement with me.

554
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.510
She comes from a good family and is beautiful.

555
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:38.230
Once I finish my work here,

556
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:41.880
I'll return to the capital and marry her.

557
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.680
Then, what about me?

558
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:46.380
You can go find someone else that's meant for you.

559
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.690
<i>[Virtuous Mountain]</i>

560
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.530
Why are you breaking things wife?

561
00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:30.960
Wife, it's all my fault.

562
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.670
I didn't keep an eye on Er Tong and he fell for Zong Yinglin's trap.

563
00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.650
Wife, I promise.

564
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.280
I really didn't use our marriage to threaten you.

565
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.240
You clearly did threaten me.

566
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.600
You even took it to court.

567
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.190
Look at you now, it was just to scare you.

568
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:51.760
How could I let others take your life?

569
00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.110
Moreover, I handle you with care, afraid that you'll break.

570
00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:58.390
And put you in my mouth, afraid that you'd melt.

571
00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:01.760
How could I let others hurt you?

572
00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:04.720
I don't even dare touch a single hair of yours.

573
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.620
Don't you think so?

574
00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.740
Were you hit earlier?

575
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.920
No!

576
00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.890
I wish you'd hit me more in the future.

577
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.120
Wife, let me tell you something.

578
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.970
I think today in court,

579
00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:28.000
Tang Feilong doesn't actually— Hey, Miss.

580
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.840
- Wife! Wife! 
 - I told you not to mention that unfaithful person.

581
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.130
Okay, I won't. Okay?

582
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:35.890
Put that down.

583
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.680
I will ask the chef to prepare some Jinan desserts.

584
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.510
Once we eat food from our hometown,

585
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.790
then you won't be mad anymore. Okay?

586
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:45.420
There's no need.

587
00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.370
We'll go home to eat.

588
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:52.400
Go home?
