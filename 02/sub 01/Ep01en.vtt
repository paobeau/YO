3
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.390
Do you know when that was?

4
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.230
I know how long it lasted.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.210
<i> Episode 1</i> 
 I don't think believing in superstitions is a bad thing. 
<i>(If you eat tofu after being released from jail, you won't go back.)</i>

7
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.670
It isn't a bad thing, but it isn't tasty.

8
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.740
I'm really sick of beans and tofu. 
 <i>(Prisons give rice with beans.)</i>

9
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.820
I'm sorry.

10
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.610
Why are you alone? What happened to the people who cried their eyes out when I went in?

11
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.980
A staff meeting was suddenly scheduled today, so they all went there.

12
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.410
They won't be too happy that I've come back after four years.

13
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.120
It's not like it's the Olympics or something.

14
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.220
You should really be careful. The mood isn't so great these days.

15
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.720
The employees who used to follow you are getting fired one after the other, and it casts a chill every time.

16
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.510
Casts a chill?

17
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.670
It means the atmosphere gets suddenly chilly and uncomfortable.

18
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.450
It'll continue to be chilly from now on.

19
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.210
Why, is there something going on again?

20
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.700
A typhoon is moving north, you see.

21
00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.050
The weather isn't even good today. Why did you come all the way here?

22
00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.720
Because I hate the supermarket.

23
00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.850
Why would you? The prices are much cheaper.

24
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.750
I hate it because the prices are cheap. I got fired because of that.

25
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.850
Why would you be working at the supermarket, when you even graduated from university?

26
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.110
Because of a red string.

27
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.820
A red string? Where?

28
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.720
On my family register. A pretty string.

29
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.370
Grandma, it looks like a nobleman will come by today.

30
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.730
What? A ghost? 
 <i> (The words ghost and nobleman sound similar.)</i>

31
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.430
Not a ghost, a nobleman.

32
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.850
You know, they say that a morning spider brings good fortune, while an evening spider brings in thieves.

33
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.820
Oh really, how did it come in here again!

34
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.540
They keep making a mess, setting their home over there!

Do you know how many times I called your name?

41
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.710
Sorry, I was looking over there and didn't pay attention.

They're doing another protest?

44
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.770
I'm  tired of it, really.

♫ Our comrades live on in our hearts ♫

46
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.500
Don't you think they must have their reasons?

47
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.280
Bullshit.

48
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.270
Why are students throwing protests day-in and day-out instead of studying like they should

49
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.950
in this hell of a world?

50
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.070
They do seem like people from a different world.

51
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:42.120
Their gaze is scary and they look really angry.

52
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.110
Just think of them as aliens. Aliens on the brink of extinction.

53
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:52.250
Anyway, this isn't important. I got into that professor's class!

For real? That's really—

55
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.180
Erotic, of course! Even the assignment is to write an erotic novel.

56
00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.990
Kids like you would never be able to attend that class.

57
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.480
I'm late! I'm leaving!

58
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.970
Bye!

59
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:09.190

Kill them! Kill them!

Kill them! Kill them! Kill them! Kill them!

63
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.270
Kill them all!

64
00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.750
Do as I do. Take a deep breath.

65
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.790
You don't know what a deep breath is?

66
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:10.290
Breathe in deeply, out, in, out.

67
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:40.150
Did they shoot tear gas?

68
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.400
No, Molotov Cocktails.

69
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.370
Why would they throw that, dammit.

70
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.780
Don't touch it.

71
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.210
Don't rub, just press on it.

And now, the keynote speech from Law Student Han Jae Hyeon.

86
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:13.200
Hello, my fellow students. I am Law Student Han Jae Hyeon, of the freshman class of '91.

87
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.670
I embrace my hot desire for the liberation of labor and liberal democracy

88
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:18.650
to greet you enthusiastically.

89
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:22.870
<i>The 13th Anniversary of the May 18, Gwangju Democracy Movement, Remembrance and Declaration of Battle</i>

90
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:31.470
Today, we take to the streets again for a better tomorrow.

91
00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:36.130
You may wonder why we are doing this again when the world has changed so much.

92
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:41.840
But everyone! There are still many places in this world that need our voices.

93
00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.350
In 1980, those who shouted for democracy in this nation in Gwangju

94
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.850
were killed by the blades of the military.

95
00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.870
Not even an inquiry was held regarding upon whose orders it happened.

96
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.200
They were only called a "commie mob" in the official records.

97
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.900
And in the name of redevelopment,

98
00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.290
families were kicked out of their homes they had lived in for 30 years.

99
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:05.080
And to allegedly preserve the companies for tomorrow,

100
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.070
there are heads of families who are being laid off without explanation.

101
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:12.600
In this capitalist society where everything is strongly pulled to the right,

102
00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.800
we are not demanding a minimum level of respect and courtesy.

103
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.220
We are talking about desperate survival.

104
00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.250
I found you, Hae Jae Hyeon.

105
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.960
Please come.

106
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.370
Thank you.

107

Are you looking for someone?

111
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.940
What? Oh, a law student, freshman class of '91.

112
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.560
Who from the freshman class of '91? We have more than just one or two of them.

 - Jae Hyeon?

114

Jae Hyeon, someone is here to see you.

115
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.860
Her face is so pretty, she is a total beauty.

116
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.390
These days, four years is enough to completely remodel the whole country.

117
00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:32.400
Honestly, your sentence was too severe.

118
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.600
Why do you think that?

119
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:41.810
Because it was the chairman who was responsible for the stock manipulation and embezzlement.

120
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.530
Sorry, are you alright?

121
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.790
So, is this considered a chill?

122
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:49.290
I apologize.

123
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.140
Ajumma! How could you just pop out into the street like that?

124
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.450
I'm sorry, my bag ripped.

125
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.820
Please get out of the way already.

126
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.560
I'm trying to get out of your way quickly.

127
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.650
What, what, what now?

128
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.360
I'm trying to get out of your way quickly.

129
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.690
What, what, what now?

130
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.700
This water is precious, like my blood.

131
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:21.950
Ajumma!

132
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.090
Sorry, because of that strange ajumma.

133
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.050
What is that?

134
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:32.110
She made sure to pick up her water bottle, but she left that behind.

135
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:34.020
It's a man's handkerchief.

136
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.010
No, she doesn't seem like someone who cares about such differences.

137
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.410
You know, those kinds of people. She doesn't care if she wears her husband's socks or underwear.

138
00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.460
- Joon Woo.
 - Yes?

139
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.770
Let's go to the company.

140
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.890
Yes, sir.

141
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.820
What? You don't want to go to your home?

142
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.710
I think I will have to visit the chairman first.

143
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.580
Dismissal from work is murder! Withdraw the dismissals!

144
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.930
Withdraw! Withdraw!

145
00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:00.090
A mayfly is called a "one-day-lifer" because it only lives for one day. We are "two-year-lifers"

146
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:02.010
because we can only live for two years.

147
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:05.020
If we work for more than two years, they must select us as permanent employees.

148
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.220
That is why the company dismisses us after two years.

149
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.030
Even if we beg, cry, and fight, the company dismisses us.

150
00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:14.460
We are "two-year-lifers" who live a scary two years.

151
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.380
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

152
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:23.570
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

153
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:27.190
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

154
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.890
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

155
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:34.420
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

156
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.950
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

157
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.860
Unjust dismissals must be withdrawn. Withdraw! Withdraw!

158
00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.410

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.590
Even if I was hit with sh*t instead of eggs, I would have still laughed maniacally.

160
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:51.950
It is my first day out, after all.

161
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.150
Prison life is not easy, of course.

162
00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.710
- You've worked hard.
 - It was nothing.

163
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.530
Do you want to return to work right away?

164
00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.660
I am apprehensive because I have been away for so long.

165
00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.600
Then go work in the supermarket department.

166
00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.700
I put Seo Kyeong in charge as CEO, but I keep having worries.

167
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.360
<i>Four years will pass by quickly.</i>

168
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.640
<i>Just close your eyes and endure for four years.</i>

169
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.620
<i>Then I will make you vice chairman of Hyeong Seong.</i>

170
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.310
Those ajummas demonstrating down there,

171
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.750
I would like it if you cleaned them out completely.

172
00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.340
You are the best when it comes to cleaning people out, aren't you?

173
00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:37.400
They didn't call you "Scissorhands" for nothing.

174
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.920
Yes, I understand.

175
00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.500
Jae Hyeon, just because the hunting dog brings the rabbit

176
00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.340
doesn't mean the hunting dog keeps the rabbit.

177
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:53.970
The hunting dog should just eat what the hunting dog usually eats.

178
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.370
If he begins to covet the rabbit,

179
00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.940
its owner will become angry, won't he?

180
00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.420
Yes.

181
00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.980
And you don't have to begin work immediately.

182
00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.260
You should play some, too.

183
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.160
Do you not know how to play because you were always working?

184
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.970
I don't know, but I'd like to try once.

185
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.000
I am a quick study, whatever it is.

190
00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.500
Hey, Yeong Min.

191
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.590
Should I buy some food before I visit?

192
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.580
Hold on, Yeong Min, I'll call you back.

193
00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:10.890
Thank you.

194
00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:15.700
It's okay, sir. I'll fix this and give it back to you.

195
00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.650
You don't have to. I should do it since my son was a victim.

196
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.540
I have a son as well.

197
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.690
That's why I want to do it for you.

198
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.310
They're really evil people.

199
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.720
What do the youth do these days?

200
00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.440
They play games and go out for drinks.

201
00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.890
Some guys go to shoot pool, too.

202
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.780
The mountains and rivers are said to change every 10 years.

203
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:46.430
You're right. How do you feel about the movies?

204
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.880
There are some great ones out.

205
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.890
No, I don't like movies.

206

208
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.780
I may be an ajumma who doesn't possess an ounce of femininity,

209
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.880
but I don't think I should brag about a woman living alone.

210
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.390
How could a scaredy-cat like you live alone?

211
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.110
I'm fine. There's nothing to do at night, anyway.

212
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:34.790
I'm going to bed early after watching TV.

213
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.300
After lighting the candles, I can see perfectly.

214
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.550
<i>I see, noblewoman from the Joseon Dynasty. You should get some fireflies for your lantern.</i>

215
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:45.210
I like the atmosphere, and it feels like a movie theater.

216
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.590
<i>You would always go to movie theaters while others went to nightclubs,</i>

217
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:52.130
<i>but you don't even go near one anymore.</i>

218
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:54.050
That's the worst place to waste your money.

219
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.310
They'll eventually air on the TV for free, anyway.

220
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.490
Stop talking like you're broke.

221
00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:02.060
Just wait a few days and I'll fix it for you.

222
00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.070

233
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:30.190
Oh, you're here for "Love Letter" too?

234
00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:36.290
How can you just leave when you said you reserved it first?

235
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:37.830
It's okay, you can watch it.

236
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:40.600
But you reserved it because you wanted to see it, too.

237
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.650
I can't watch it alone. I feel too sorry.

238
00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:44.710
So?

I'm good.

243

I won't spread rumors.

244
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.260
Nobody would believe me, anyway.

245
00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:02.590
Who would believe that an activist senior wanted to watch a melodramatic Japanese movie, anyway?

246

It's a habit to exercise my fingers.

Okay.

270
00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:32.000
The music from the movie was so nice, right?

271
00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.480
I could play it, too.

272

There's a piece I've been obsessed with lately.

Would you like to hear it?

274

No.

275
00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:47.330
That's too bad. I'm free every Wednesday during fourth period.

276
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.000
I practice alone in room 301 in the music building.

When will we meet again?

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:59.350
- When will we what? 
 - Meet again.

280
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.420
Why would we meet again?

281
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:03.700
Because we'll miss each other.

282
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:05.790
Go.

283
00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.430
We should meet up.

284
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:09.760
I'm busy.

285
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:12.510

Is that something to get in trouble for?

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.260
- I want to do it, too. 
 - Studying or protesting?

289
00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.380
Protesting. I like exercising, too. 
<i>(T/N: protesting and exercising are the same word in Korean.)</i>

290
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.340
I was a horseback rider when I was young.

291
00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:31.000
My "exercise" is protesting against rich families like yours.

292
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.620
I wonder how they'd react if they heard their pampered daughter

293
00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.730
who took horseback riding lessons hung around a protester.

294
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:40.280
I wasn't pampered.

295
00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.870
- Which bus are you taking? 
 - Number 12.

I won't give up! So you should give up!

299
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:07.130
I will date you, even if it's the last thing I do!

I didn't mean you had to turn it off.

303
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:39.740
Anyway, welcome back. You worked hard.

304
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.030
You had a hard time alone, too.

305
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.140
Sorry I couldn't go earlier today.

306

It's okay. It's not like I won a gold medal.

 - Hawaii?

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:59.030

To Hawaii?

311
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:05.450
Market research to see if we can launch our market there.

312
00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.150
Okay, have a good time.

313
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:13.200
I'm really not going on vacation.

314
00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.780
Okay, I got it.

315
00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:20.940
Also, I have a favor.

316
00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:26.050
Pay some more attention to Joon Seo.

317
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.940
The poor kid's been without his dad for four years.

318
00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.260
They say no matter how well a mom does, boys need their dads.

319
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:39.050
I'll try. But... I'm going to get busier, too.

320
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.250
I thought you told them you're not returning to work right away.

321
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.320
I'm going to take a vacation.

322
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:46.870
A good one.

323
00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.400
They put you in jail for four years and now they screw you big time.

324
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.810
First, they say vice chairman of headquarters but you ended up as market vice president.

325
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:57.430
We should be grateful. They're acting just as we expected.

326
00:33:57.430 --> 00:34:01.820
In the end, Hyeong Seong Mart is the end of the succession project.

327
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.980
It's at the top of Hyeong Seong's governance structure.

328
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.920
And the thing I asked you to do?

329
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.620
I delivered the documents to the press's inspection agency.

330
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.460
I did what you told me, but what are we fighting with?

331
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.410
We don't have any shares or live ammunition.

332
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:22.610
Pandora's box or the Trojan horse?

333
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:25.230
Can you explain it more easily, please?

334
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.060
Whether Pandora's box is opened or enemy soldiers pour out from the Trojan horse,

335
00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.690
our opponents won't just stand by and watch.

336
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:41.110
Would you understand if I say our weapon and live ammunition is stirring up the enemy and making them take action?

337
00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.040
I understand.

338
00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:50.220
By the way, I have a picture of the Madam...

339
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.050
- A picture? 
 - Yes.

340
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.640
Director.

341
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.280
I'm sorry. What were you saying...

342
00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.350
Are you okay?

343
00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:35.180
One minute.

344
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:59.440
Son, what did you have for dinner?

345
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.820
<i>Rice.</i>

346
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.650
What did you eat it with? Froggies?

347
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.530
<i>Mom. I have to do homework.</i>

348
00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.790
Alright. You have no aegyo (cuteness), son.

349
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.920
Hang up, then.

350
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.360
My hand slipped.

351
00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.460
Sorry, First Place Beggar.

352
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:38.560
Looks like you'll need to get more.

353
00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.590
Now that we're all moms from Gook Jae Middle School, let's support our kids well

354
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.380
and work together to fix any issues at school.

355
00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:09.320
Yes, yes, don't worry.

356
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:11.380
What problems would there be at school?

357
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:14.040
All our kids are from wealthy homes.

358
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.440
School violence only happens with kids who are from poor homes.

359
00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.420
- True, true. 
 - It's true.

360
00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:24.720
I heard Yeong Min scored first place in the final exams again.

361
00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.730
He's never let go of first place since he enrolled.

362
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:30.610
Yeong Min's mom, you're a piano major, right?

363
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:33.670
- What does his dad do? 
 - Actually...

364
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:36.850
He's a lawyer in Gangnam.

365
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:41.270
No wonder. I don't know about other things, but the smart kids inherit good genes.

366
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.780
- You're right. 
 - Yeah.

367
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:47.820
The wealthier ones are more frugal. Just cookies for first place celebration?

368
00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:54.570
You have it rough, too. Having to be a parents' representative because your kid got top marks.

369
00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.530
She doesn't seem as chatty as us.

370
00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:00.120
Who are you calling chatty?

371
00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.200
We're not chatty.

372
00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:08.040
<i>Sunbae Hwa Jin is dead.</i>

373
00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:13.740
♫ <i>Where have my comrades gone?</i> ♫

374
00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:18.840
♫ <i>Only flags stream</i> ♫

375
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:23.930
♫ <i>Until a new day comes</i> ♫

376
00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:29.280
♫ <i>Let's not lose our resolve</i> ♫

377
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:34.280
♫ <i>Even when the times go by</i> ♫

378
00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:39.340
♫ The mountains and streams all know ♫

379
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:49.730
♫ When we wake up we passionately shout ♫

380
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:53.600
It's been a while, hyungs.

381
00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.990
You look good, Hyung.

382
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:58.560
Is it because you're the son-in-law of a wealthy family?

383
00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.360
You look like a million bucks, even though you've been in jail.

384
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.500
Only the dead person is pitiable.

385
00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:04.970
Everyone else is eating and living well.

386
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:08.290
Hey, Kyeong Ho. I understand how you're feeling, but—

387
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.450
If you weren't even going to finish it,

388
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:13.590
why did you drag her in?

389
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.830
If it weren't for you, she would have gone to school with a full scholarship

390
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.830
and become a lawyer, judge, or prosecutor.

391
00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:26.940
That foolish girl suffered alone doing labor movements.

392
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.710
Couldn't you have asked why she was doing that?

393
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:34.630
If you considered the feelings of someone showing up in front of their past crush after 20 years

394
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:40.050
asking to borrow money for even one minute, you wouldn't have treated her that way.

395
00:40:40.050 --> 00:40:43.570
So you're saying that Hwa Jin's death

396
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:47.890
- is my fault? 
 - Yeah, you jerk.

397
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.540
<i>I saw your interview in a magazine.</i>

398
00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:00.560
<i>- 5 years ago - 
 I was so proud of you.</i>

399
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.500
<i>Did you come to see me because you were proud?</i>

400
00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.700
<i>Oh. that's not it...</i>

401
00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:09.370
<i>Then?</i>

402
00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:15.360
<i>Can you lend me some money, Jae Hyeon?</i>

403
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.790
<i>Kyeong Ho and I both have bad credit, so we can't get loans.</i>

404
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:23.020
<i>We can't get any more private loans either.</i>

405
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.000
<i>Would it be alright for you to receive my money?</i>

406
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:35.460
<i>Didn't your organization report me and my company to the Ministry of Labor?</i>

407
00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:40.480
<i>All of "my" money is actually that company's money.</i>

408
00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:47.300
<i>You're right. I came to the wrong person.</i>

409
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.110
<i>I'm sorry, I'm in a bad place these days.</i>

410
00:41:58.570 --> 00:41:59.990
<i>How much do you need?</i>

411
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.510
<i>It's fine. I don't need it.</i>

412
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:06.850
<i>No, you're right.</i>

413
00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:11.360
<i>I shouldn't take that dirty money.</i>

414
00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.760
<i>LP Music Cafe
 Beer / Wine</i>

415
00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.490
Ji Soo.

416
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:10.920
It was cancer, I heard.

417
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:16.000
Because she had no money, she wasn't able to get surgery on time.

418
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:22.490
Didn't you say

419
00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.000
she had a child?

420
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.910
Yes, an eight-year-old son.

421
00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.460
She must have

422
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:39.000
been in a lot of pain.

423
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.910
She must have hurt so much, that she couldn't even speak.

424
00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.490
For the first time, I regret

425
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.060
that I turned my back on everyone and left.

426
00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:00.970
If I hadn't,

427
00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.250
I could have seen her more.

428
00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.080
You didn't have a choice back then.

429
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.280
One, two, three.

430
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:20.560
You're allowed three seconds when you take one photo.

431
00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:25.680
A farewell like this is quite cruel.

432
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:30.490
No forewarning, no redo.

433
00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:33.970
Only helplessness.

434
00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.680
Do you think the others felt

435
00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:43.320
the same way when I left?

436
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.010
How is that the same as this?

437
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.990
Stop blaming yourself. It changes nothing.

438
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:56.190
And I'm sure Hwa Jin went to a better place.

439
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:59.720
She did so many good deeds, after all.

440
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.380
At this age, there are never any happy occasions for family gatherings.

441
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:16.040
Only investigations, dammit.

442
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.000
You should get regular medical exams.

443
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.340
Isn't that the only "report card" we get for the rest of our remaining lives?

444
00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.340
You can tell with one look the kind of life you've led.

445
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:30.270
And it estimates the progress you are likely to make.

446
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:33.170
I am not afraid of such a report card at all.

447
00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:35.090
Then what are you afraid of?

448
00:45:35.090 --> 00:45:38.160
That we miraculously have a reunion,

449
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.350
but it is with a death portrait.

450
00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.760
Do you mean Yoon Ji Soo?

451
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:52.850
Hey, how old is Ji Soo that you are already anticipating her obituary?

452
00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.110
Well, Hwa Jin wasn't at that age, either.

453
00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.080
And I couldn't find her, no matter how much I looked.

454
00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.680
Are you the National Intelligence Service?

455
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:01.880
The CIA?

456
00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:05.450
How can you find everyone you want? I'm sure she is hiding well somewhere.

457
00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:07.050
Do you think so?

458
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:09.250
And you know, Ji Soo,

459
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.270
she isn't such a shabby player.

460
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:15.470
She's lithe and delicate, so people think she is a fragile woman.

461
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.630
But in college, Yoon Ji Soo was a total warrior.

462
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.390
You know those girls who go around wearing only tights, like Black Widow?

463
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.850
Wow, very scary, wow.

464
00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.890
Wow, Engineering Major Unni, you are the best.

465
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.920
We don't learn this stuff in the engineering department, you know.

466
00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:38.430
Are you going to keep using my high-caliber talent this way?

467
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:40.400
I'll make you something yummy.

468
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.740
How long will you keep doing those protests that don't make you any money?

469
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:48.360
You are so consistent about your hatred for those demos.

470
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.300
Because I am an advocate for peace.

471
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.740
I don't think I can do it for much longer.

472
00:46:55.740 --> 00:47:00.210
I admit that I am happy to hear that. But why?

473
00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:02.820
My father's nurse is asking for a raise.

474
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:06.590
You said only she can handle your father.

475
00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:09.590
So you are grateful to her,

476
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.670
but what if she's asking because she knows that?

477
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.090
Hye Jeong.

478
00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:15.800
Yes?

479
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.510
I think I'm going to throw up.

480
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.680
Some days, I sit in the street with other unnis, and drink just one bottle of mineral water.

481
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.180
But I spend other days with other moms who spend the same amount as those unnis' monthly living expenses in one blow,

482
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.600
eating brunch in hotels and laughing.

483
00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.350
It makes me nauseous.

484
00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:36.250
So just pick one and drop the other.

485
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.320
That will keep you from getting sick.

486
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.770
I can't leave behind those unnis who sit in the streets.

487
00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.020
But thinking of Yeong Min,

488
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:47.340
I can't make any unpleasant faces at those moms, either.

489
00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:51.180
I even put on a mask to play piano.

490
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:56.990
The person who said you become wise once you reach the age of 40

491
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.520
should be flogged.

492
00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.060
We are flopping around like wind-sock puppets, wisdom my ass.

493
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.590
I thought when I reached this age,

494
00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.040
I would read travel books while sitting in a massage chair elegantly,

495
00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:18.310
lying on a heavenly beach, munching on cucumbers,

496
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.200
getting a sun tan. But wow, reality.

497
00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.550
I go to "heaven" often.

498

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:42.100
Yes, I feel too ashamed.

502
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:44.980
You said your son is at an international school?

503
00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.380
That must cost so much money.

504
00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:49.990
Isn't that being too greedy, in your situation?

505
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.040
You don't know?

506
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.960
He scored 1st place in International Olympiad (academic competitions) and things like that for many years.

507
00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:58.700
So that school took him as a scholarship student for all three years.

508
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.810
- They pay all his tuition.
 - Goodness, really?

509
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:06.660
Then you should go and take care of him, instead of being here.

510
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.990
But I feel too sorry. I will continue to come, at least for this week.

- You don't have to.
 - Go, already.

Yes, I didn't do anything to him.

I know that a similar thing happened when you were in sixth grade.

So you didn't do anything this time, just like that last time?

<i>Hwabon Station</i>

550
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.810
As follows, the responsibility for the breakdown of this marital relationship

551
00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.430
clearly lies with defendant Lee Se Hoon.

552
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:15.940
But Plaintiff Yoon Ji Soo rejects any monetary compensation including alimony and child support

553
00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.810
and only requests the custody of their child, Lee Yeong Min.

554
00:55:18.810 --> 00:55:21.970
So this court's judgment is as follows:

555
00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:25.080
Regarding Lee Yeong Min,

556
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:29.840
his custody is awarded to plaintiff Yoon Ji Soo.

557
00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.380
And alimony and child support which is the responsibility of the defendant,

558
00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.980
is exempted as requested by the plaintiff.

561
00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.940
I have no intention of raising Yeong Min with your or your mother's money.

I understand your objective, but will it be possible?

563
00:55:53.150 --> 00:55:57.560
If anything ever happens to Yeong Min, I will use it to sue you for custody.

564
00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.260
And I won't give up on you, either.

565

As long as Yeong Min exists, you can never go far away.

Ah, yes, we should.

00:56:34.910 --> 00:56:38.220
Yes, Yeong Min, let's go out now.

578

Goodness, how angry he must have been.

579
00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.450
I'm sorry. Shall I go and speak with him?

580
00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:20.630
Please stay here.

581
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:29.330
I request that you do not call a hearing regarding school violence.

582
00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:33.290
Since you left so suddenly, I thought you were very angry.

583
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:36.010
I left because I didn't feel that the situation merited such a fervent apology.

584
00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:39.240
But this is a clear case of school violence,

585
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.790
- and the school has policies about discipline—
 - I saw Joon Soo before coming here.

586
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.790
It's not something to worry so much about, so please take care of it as such.

587
00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:50.430
Yeong Min, talk to me.

588
00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.830
There had to have been a reason for this.

589
00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.880
You're the type to set mayflies free, so you wouldn't attack someone without reason.

590
00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.460
So tell me. Was there some kind of problem?

591
00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:07.540
So, are they kicking me out of school?

592
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:09.840
No.

593
00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:14.760
The victim's family is showing us favor. Nothing much will happen.

594
00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:20.410
So, Yeong Min, you must tell me what really happened.
