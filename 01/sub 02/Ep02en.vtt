00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.410

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.060

<i>[Episode 2]<br> [Military Training Adventures]</i>

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.150
At ease!

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.290
Hello, classmates. I am second year Zhao Fanzhou.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.700
For this military training,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.710
- I will be the assistant instructor.<br>- Why is there an assistant instructor?

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.150
It's because I heard that during last year's military training,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.300
a student and the instructor had a conflict and things got really unpleasant.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.160
So this year, the school asked the student association to assist with communications.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.650
The one in charge of our formation is from the Forensic Science Department.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.520
He's the new student association president.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.180
How do you know so much?

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.480
Because... I usually like to go on forums.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.070
Next, we'll begin today's training.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.980
<i>Why is it him again?</i>

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.470
<i>Such bad luck!</i>

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.470
Attention!

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.770
1, 1, 1, 2, 1.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.820
Arms to the side.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.190
Forearms hold steady.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.340
I can't do it anymore. Take care of my parents for me.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.670
I can't do it anymore either.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.090
Your parents are on their own.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.520
How about this, I'll count to three.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.170
- We'll both fall to the ground. <br> - Wait.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.540
Let me get into the mood. Foaming at the mouth.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.440
Foaming at the mouth is usually due to phosphate poisoning

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.130
or someone with epilepsy.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.700
May I ask which one you are?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.570
I was just joking. I love running.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.470
Running makes me healthy.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.210
- Then good luck. <br> - Good luck!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.870
Zhou Xiao, do you know him?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.680
Don't mention it. It's an ill-fated relationship.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.250
Ill-fated!

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.240
Tao Ling, you didn't take a nap?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.390
What's wrong with you?

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.960
How's my sickly look?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.510
You scared me. What's this crazy ghost make-up?<br><i>(T/N: Literally, what ghost did you draw?)</i>

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.100
Military training ghost.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.980
Here, here. Let me put some makeup on you and we'll both act dead in the dorm.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.700
No need, you do it yourself. I don't trust you.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.560
And if we sweat, the make-up will run. Besides,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.490
if that Zhao Fanzhou sees me,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.900
he'll definitely scold me even more. You can go play by yourself.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.600
Don't! You can't expect to achieve anything if you don't take risks! Haven't you heard of that?

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.230
Here, close your eyes.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.600
Imagine it with me.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.140
We're lying in the dorm and cold wind is blowing through the air conditioner.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.500
It's so cool and at this time,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.020
we're eating snacks, such as chips and sweet potato chips,

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.570
and iced watermelon.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.220
The most important thing is,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.110
you can also hear the wailing outside of everyone else baking in the sun.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.120
Doesn't it sound amazing?

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.570
Yes! Come on, come on!

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.710
- I'm drooling. <br> - Me too.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.110
Make it redder.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.610
- Over here, too.<br>- Wei-wei.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.300
Wei-wei, should I do it for you, too?

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.210
I... I don't dare.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.530
Wait, her look just now, was it doubting my make-up skills?

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.800
Eyes ahead!

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.060
What's going on? How comes it's different from our script?

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.620
Shouldn't he be asking if we're feeling okay?

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.610
He's changing the script without telling us.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.570
Why don't you add some plot?

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.770
- That's good, too. Cooperate with me; be the prop in my performance.<br>- Okay.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.080
What kind of lousy acting is that?

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.840
It hurts so much.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.760
- What's wrong?<br>- Instructor,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.850
our stomach hurts. I think we ate something bad.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.920
And I think we have a bit of heatstroke, we feel dizzy.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.760
Ate something bad?

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.110
You'll feel better if you squat a bit.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.370
Instructor, I need to use the toilet.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.800
- Zhao Fanzhou.<br>- Here.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.400
Come over here.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.310
The school strongly emphasized that during military training,

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.450
we need to have a good rapport with students, but the make-up of these two students

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.780
is testing my intelligence. You take care of it.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.810
Sir! Please handle it according to the military training regulations.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.860
Okay. Then we'll do...

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.660
revert back to human form in 10 minutes and do 30 push-ups.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.800
- You supervise them.<br>- Yes, Sir!

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:53.720
- How do we do 30 push-ups?<br>- Clench your jaw and do it.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.890
No, I have to handle this senior in a bit.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:59.700
- Cooperate with me.<br>- Forget it. I shouldn't have listened to your lousy idea in the first place.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.700
You just wait.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.180
Are you ready? Get started.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.620
Senior,

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.490
can we not do so many? We promise never to do it again.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:15.720
No.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:20.370
- Senior, don't be so unreasonable.<br>- On the count of three.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.770
1, 2, 3.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.440
- 1...<br>- 1...

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.500
2... 3...

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.930
Isn't it resting time? Where's Zhou Xiao?

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.680
17, 18,

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.580
19.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.600
I can't do it anymore.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.690
Just kill me.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.930
We're halfway done. Come on.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.080
If you finish them,

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.000
I'll give you all of Luo Wei's sweet potato chips.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.290
I really can't anymore. Even if you give me the immortality fruit,<br><i>(T/N: Also known as melon eggplant or ginseng fruit)</i>

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.220
I still won't be able to survive.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.300
Can I...

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.760
finish it for her?

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.770
I'll do both of theirs.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.890
Is 50 enough?

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.110
Stop messing around. Leave!

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.610
Cai Yasi, your appearance really isn't normal.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.400
Someone who won a computer award is extraordinary.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.340
Then I'll give you guys a few more.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.920
You doing this isn't helping their punishment.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.600
- 18, 19, <br> - It's a waste of energy.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.900
20, 21...

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.070
We're all classmates. You don't need to go this far.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.980
- 23, <br>- This is a principle.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.390
- 24, 25,<br>- 24.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.500
Zhou Xiao, say, will they get into a fight over us?

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.270
I've never had a guy that fought over me.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.610
- Shut up and start counting!<br><i>- All students...</i>

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.900
- 26, <br><i>-...gather on the field immediately!</i>

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.790
- 27, <br><i>- All students...</i>

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.710
<i>...gather on the field immediately!</i>

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.960
They're gathering at the field already. Brother Cai, just go.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.880
I'm almost done counting.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.180
28, 29, 30!

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.520
I'm done.

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:44.630
Me.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.300
Tao Ling's also done, she did it with me.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.230
Go back.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.930
Thank you.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.400
- Let's go! Water, water. <br>- Let's go! Bye, Senior.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.560
Hurry up, Zhou Xiao! Throw that to me.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.740
- Tao Ling, put this on my desk.<br> - Okay.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:33.590
Where's your hairspray? Give it to me.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.530
You scared me.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.410
Wei-wei, take this hairspray and spray it on the edge of the blankets, and then straighten it.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.690
It makes it easier to fold into a tofu shape.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.280
Okay.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.970
- Zhou Xiao, give me Zhu Lu's hair curler.<br>- This one?

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.670
What are you doing with it?

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:11.770
Stuff it in. Help me.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.570
Will this work?

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.760
Xiao-xiao, what about my hair straightener? There's no place to put it.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.520
Your...

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.830
Coming!

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.210
I'll go open the door.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.710
What do we do? Me?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.800
- Hello, Instructor. <br>- Hello, dorm inspection.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.620
Why are you standing so far away?

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.750
Instructor, it's a bit hot.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:15.160
It's you guys again. I guess I'll need to check this dorm thoroughly.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:23.340
Instructor, Student Zhou Xiao threw away a prohibited item.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.560
What prohibited item?

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.340
What prohibited item? I didn't throw anything. What are you talking about?

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:34.330
Don't speak nonsense. And how did you know my name?

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.020
It's written on the bed. Oh right, Fanzhou! Didn't you see it ,too?

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.680
I didn't see anything.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.860
It's okay, you must be seeing things. We forgive you.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:54.120
We forgive you.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.200
Maybe I did see it wrong.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.810
Let's take a look around.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.140
- Yes, Sir.<br>- Yes, Sir.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:45.220
Instructor, there's nothing wrong here.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.020
Instructor, there's nothing wrong here either.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.160
I think this dorm is fine.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.920
Your blankets are folded neatly, too.

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.640
- You all know the school does not allow high-output electrical appliances, right?<br>- Yes.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.880
- Be careful.<br>- Okay.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:01.830
Let's go.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:03.590
- Yes, Sir. <br>- Yes, Sir.

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.590
- Goodbye, Instructor.<br>- Bye-bye, Instructor.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.460
Why is it him again?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.190
Instructor.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.160
I still think room 415 is a safety hazard.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.970
I think it's fine.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.520
But I really saw that girl throw out a hair straightener.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.390
That thing has a high output and is quite dangerous.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:33.190
Keep in mind to catch the big ones and let go of the small. Don't keep going back to this.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.360
Fanzhou, you also saw it, too. Right?

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.910
No.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.570
All right, let's check the next room. We can rest the sooner we finish.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.030
Yes, Sir.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.530
It's so good to have you guys.

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.300
Let's stew pig trotters tonight.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:02.800
Coming.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.400
You're back? Forgot your key?

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.430
Thanks.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.370
Does that really help with heatstroke?

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.930
I don't know. The school doctor gave it to me.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.480
What's this?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.570
Who touched my stuff?

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.860
I organized your desk because we had a dorm inspection.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.330
I organized your bedsheets.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:47.170
I took your hair-curler and hid it. I'll return it to you now.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.220
It's stuck, it's stuck.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.470
It's stuck.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:02.000
What's this smell on my bed?

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.970
We had to fold the blankets into a tofu shape, I sprayed some hairspray.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.420
I taught her.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.550
How am I supposed to sleep now?

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.890
Sorry.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.190
Ignore her.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:31.630
It's my fault, I shouldn't have given you that lousy idea.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:36.380
Sorry, they suddenly had to check our dorms, so we didn't think too much about it.

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.090
It was all for the good of our dorm.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.230
All right. I'll leave you guys here.

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.500
Thank you for today. It's late, get some rest.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.450
Goodbye, Instructor.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.780
- Bye.<br>- Bye.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.890
Fanzhou, I really did see a prohibited electrical appliance in dorm 415.

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.270
It's fine. Let's just leave it at that.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:05.590
I'm going. You should also head back and get some rest.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.160
What a magnificent sight!

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.020
Why is this here?

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.930
I feel like I'm out collecting scraps. It works.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.730
Why is it you again?

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.790
You're not writing novels but changed careers to be a peeping tom?

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:09.130
No, I found this.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:10.990
Then, what are you doing?

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.750
I'm taking a walk, that's what I'm doing.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.940
- Really? <br> - Yes.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.910
What are you two doing?

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.260
You... this... You, come with me to the security office.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.630
Auntie, this–

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:35.420
Auntie, it's not like that. Let me explain.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:45.650
You guys work diligently to pick them up, I'll be checking your progress later.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:49.240
I was going to say... every time we check the dorms,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.910
that entire yard of grass is full of trash.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.370
I finally caught the culprits today. Go.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.900
They're so fast! They each have lightning speed.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.670
What if they took my stuff? This is such bad luck for me.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.330
Are you trying to get this?

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.210
Yeah. This one.

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.710
Hurry up.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.210
I can't reach if you don't go down.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:08.910
Right. Sorry.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:19.370
<i>It's such a long scar.</i>

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.260
Here.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.520
Thanks.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:46.700
Today, we're doing a small game for physical training.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.990
Xiao, I wish I can die on the spot.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.990
- It's just military training. Is it worth it?<br>- Exactly.

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:00.670
What are you mumbling about? Climbing training is something we do every year! What's there to complain about?

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:03.120
If you don't believe me, you can ask your senior,

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.100
- Zhao Fanzhou. <br> - Here.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.350
- Tell everyone. <br>- It's true.

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.160
What's your time?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.170
Sir, I forgot.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.610
Tell him to do it again and we'll know.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.400
- Was I very loud? <br> - Yeah.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.950
- Zhao Fanzhou. <br>- Here!

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.220
A student said for you to do it again.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.590
Get ready.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:41.770
1, 2, 3. Start!

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.960
Your senior's moves are very methodic.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.210
Watch carefully, arms straight.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:51.320
Using the feet as points, the body is relaxed.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:23:00.580
So handsome. I feel like if he takes off his forensic scientist robe, it's all muscle underneath.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.050
I have a guess.

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.600
What guess?

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.740
He might have a criminal record.

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.760
32 seconds, not bad.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.790
Now, we'll start today's official training.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.860
Fanzhou, are you going home for Independence Day?

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.280
We can go back together.

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.480
I'm not going back.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.450
But Auntie...

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.230
I'm so tired. Once I think about how we have to do frog jumps this afternoon, I just want to bite off my tongue and die.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.580
If you die, can you come after my soul?

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.210
- Thanks. <br> - Who's coming after your soul?<br><i>(T/N: It can also mean someone caught her interest)</i>

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:22.050
- Are you that bored?<br>- You're here.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:27.050
You two are too much! You didn't even wait for me to eat.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.600
You didn't even get your food, don't you feel embarrassed?

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:34.150
Hello, I'm Cai Yasi. A buddy of Zhou Xiao.

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:37.620
Hello, I'm Luo Wei. Zhou Xiao's dormmate.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.460
Dormmate.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.560
Zhou Xiao must've caused a lot of trouble for you guys.

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.660
Her brain is a bit weird.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.090
Her reflexes are very slow so please excuse her.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.950
Who are you talking about?

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.930
Who is the one that keeps buying game accessories and tries to get free food from friends?

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:55.720
What a coincidence, you really didn't eat.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.390
I forgot. I forgot.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.150
Sorry, there's a backup.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:06.740
All right, Zhou Xiao. You dare talk to me this way? You're done for.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.890
What are you doing?

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.190
Don't worry, just eat.

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.520
- Don't look. <br>- You–

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:17.930
Look.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.150
- What is it?<br> - Show me.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:23.540
It's big pig trotters!

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:30.540
I need to go back to the lab. Take your time eating.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.300
I'm done, too.

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:35.770
Stop looking! Don't zoom in on my nostrils.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.900
Don't zoom in.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.160
I already saw it.

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.270
Whatever. You're not the only one.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.130
Stop talking to us randomly, thank you.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.310
Close it, close it.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.940
No.

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:06.530
Who's she?

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:11.580
She's our new student representative. I've seen her picture on our school's forum.

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.490
Does she have a grudge against you?

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.140
No.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.670
Delete it.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:21.460
It's fine. I have backups.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.720
Both eyes straight ahead.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.200
Don't waver. Stand!

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:37.230
Student Zhu Lu, do you want to take a break?

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.490
Instructor, no need.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:42.290
Squat!

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.200
Stand!

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.220
<i>[Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui] <br>(T/N: herbal medicine for heatstroke; contains alcohol)</i>

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.630
Today's instructor was so mean. Frog jumps!

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:05.230
- My legs aren't mines anymore. <br>- Yeah.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.290
I have an idea.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.960
- Thanks.<br>- Take revenge for me.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.780
Here, try it.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.730
- How is it? <br> - It's like I'm stepping on clouds.

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.830
- How awesome! I want some!<br>- I want some, too.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:30.950
¥5 for one.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:32.180
So noisy!

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.620
Can you guys be quiet? It's so noisy!

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.150
So what that we're noisy for a bit?

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:40.290
Zhu Lu, we've endured you for a really long time!

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.870
You're always so mean every day! Why should we endure it?

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:48.910
Because I'm your dormmate and you guys don't like me!

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.450
Are we that obvious?

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.590
You guys all exclude me.

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:03.430
I want to change dorms. I'm going to change you all!

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.950
Fine, then go tell the Dorm Manager Auntie to change.

00:28:05.950 --> 00:28:08.530
- I'm not going!<br>- Fine, then I'll go.

00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.190
Wait, wait!

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.510
I think something's wrong. Let me go see.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:24.100
Zhu Lu?

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.220
Do you know who you are?

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.690
Zhu Lu...

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:34.720
Who's that?

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:40.370
Zhu Lu... Is it a Xiao Lu (small deer)?

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.660
Do you know who I am?

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.500
- Be careful, be careful. <br>- I'm a small deer!

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.940
- Yeah, yeah, you're a small deer.<br>- Be careful! There's a step.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.310
Let's go, my mount.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.960
Let's go.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.700
Hurry up!

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.590
Let's go. Hurry.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.400
My feet hurt!

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.940
Here.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:13.230
What's wrong with her?

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:15.920
What kind of shock is she in?

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.950
Is it because I was too mean scolding her earlier?

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:26.580
From what I've noticed, she was weird before you guys started fighting.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:28.270
Then, what's wrong with her?

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.760
She kept saying she's a small deer earlier.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.690
- Doctor. <br>- Doctor, how's my dormmate?

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:40.010
These are her lab results.

00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:44.420
Nothing serious, she's just drunk.

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.430
We're in military training every day, how do we have time to go drinking?

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:49.970
I've looked at her medical records.

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.000
She was prescribed a box of Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui yesterday at the hospital. Did she drink it?

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.690
Yes, I saw her drink it yesterday.

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:03.420
Then she got drunk from drinking Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui.

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.600
It's fine. She can leave once she wakes up.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.760
- Thank you. <br> - You guys can take care of her.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.220
Thank you.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.660
You can get drunk from Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui? That's impressive!

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.730
Scared me to death.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:30.930
<i>[Campus Hospital]</i>

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.470
<i>Who's this?</i>

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.620
<i>- Here's another one.<br>- Xiao Lu!</i>

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.030
<i>- Xiao Lu!<br>- Wei-wei!</i>

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:06.470
Wei-wei! Wei-wei.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.500
Go check. I think Xiao Lu is awake.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.170
- What did you just call her? <br> - Xiao Lu.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.900
Who is Zhu Lu? Is Zhu Lu a Xiao Lu (small deer)?

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.240
Do you want to die, calling her that?

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.760
Her ice-cold demeanor has completely cracked.

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.560
I'm not scared of her anymore.

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.020
She's awake.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.550
Are you okay?

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:54.890
Where am I?

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.760
The doctor said you got drunk from drinking Huoxiang Zhengqi Shui.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.260
I didn't cause trouble for you guys, did I?

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.770
You really don't remember anything?

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.250
No.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.220
It's not much trouble.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.440
Just that you got drunk and kept taking off your clothes, we couldn't stop–

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.420
When did I do that? I just... grabbed your hair...

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.810
Didn't you say you didn't remember?

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.760
- Xiao Lu.<br>- Xiao Lu.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.600
You guys are so annoying.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.540
Eyes right.

00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.670
Ready, front. Goose-step.

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:52.170
1!

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:07.860
Gua-gua.<br><i>(frog sound)</i>

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.000
Gua-gua.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.300
Gua-gua.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.760
Gua-gua.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.420
Student Tao Ling, what's "gua-gua"? Is a frog jump done by your mouth?

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.250
Instructor, it's so tiring.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.050
If I don't find anything fun to do, I can't jump anymore.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.280
Gua-gua, gua-gua.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:36.030
You have good speaking skills. Too bad military training tests your endurance, not your public speaking.

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:39.140
Student Zhou Xia is more serious than you.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:44.780
Instructor, I'm not being serious. I'm...

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.490
too tired to do it with her.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.250
Gua-gua.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.650
Okay. You can rest.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.390
I used my body to defend everyone's resting time.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:07.930
Rest for 10 minutes, and then jump another 100 meters.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:13.570
Instructor, you're too merciless!

00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:33.250
You're up?

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:42.980
Are you up, too?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.700
It hurts!

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:00.930
What are you guys doing?

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:03.160
Leg hurts.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.330
That much?

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:09.870
Our instructor had us do frog jumps for 300 meters.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:12.480
This is the accumulation of lactic acid after exercise.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.220
Don't worry. Continue the military training and it'll turn the lactic acid into nothing.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.540
Student Xiao Lu, please put away that face of rejoicing toward other people's misfortune.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.170
Advance.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:27.050
Don't come any closer.

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:33.980
- My ankle, right there.<br>- It hurts here.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.240
This big?

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.040
Xiao Lu! My ankle, my ankle.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.850
Up, up. Yes, yes.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.080
And here, my knee.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.660
My knee, my knee.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.500
My god.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:05.550
Endure it.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:08.280
Good luck.

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:12.460
Zhou Xiao!

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.300
- What's wrong? <br> - Cai Yasi, pick that up.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.750
Fine, why are you so mean?

00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:43.430
Zhou Xiao, you're impressive now. You dare talk to me in this way.

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.920
Bro, my leg hurts and I can't bend down!

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.460
Do you know why this happened? It's because you don't get enough exercise. You know?

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.480
I don't know. Give it to me.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:03.050
So you have to try harder!

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.520
Good luck.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:16.180
Cai Yasi, once I'm better. I'll smash you into the wall that you can't even be peeled off!

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:55.020
Student Zhao Fanzhou, well...

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.000
can you pick up my hat for me?

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.540
Are you sure?

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.160
It's fine! I'll do it myself. You can go on your way.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:46.620
Thank you.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.570
No problem.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:58.630
He just smiled at me.

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.810
Why did he smile at me?

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.900
I'm so scared.

00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.450
Psycho.

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.630
At ease.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:26.570
Today is the last day of military training. I hope everyone gets energized

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.140
and finishes off this last line of duty. In the morning,

00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.830
we'll conduct a wireless real combat drill. This afternoon will be the concluding ceremony.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:37.680
And then, this year's military training will be over!

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.600
Yes!

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.070
<i>Freshmen, the activity area will be in the hill behind the school.</i>

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.370
<i>Five people per group. Eight groups total, each will be given 30 minutes.</i>

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.130
<i>In 30 minutes, those who don't find the hidden transmitter</i>

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:54.150
<i>will be counted as a fail. Half your military training credits will be deducted.</i>

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.370
Instructor, everything is going well.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.600
Are you okay?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.150
What are you doing?

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:38.320
Checking your injury.

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:43.210
I just fell. It's not that serious.

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:48.760
Injuries to the head can lead to concussions or bleeding in the brain.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.710
Clinical display as Retrograde amnesia. Temporarily loss of consciousness and headache,

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:59.040
nausea and vomiting are all possible. More severe cases can cause–

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.870
Then... can you please check for me immediately?

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.240
Here.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.890
Say will "you heal what you eat" work?

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.910
Right now, I really want to eat baked pig's brain.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.920
Don't laugh. Once you laugh, I get goosebumps.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.470
Am I okay?

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.560
Let me check. Don't move.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.620
Be gentle.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.510
There.

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:44.570
<i>Student Zhao Fanzhou, someone's injured at the hill's exit. Go check it out.</i>

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.340
Roger.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.500
Didn't you say I have a concussion? Where are you going?

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.540
You...

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.490
You're fine.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.520
I'm fine?

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.290
Why do you have two of those in your hands?

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.140
Sorry, I thought you'd be able to catch it.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.310
This is your friend's. Give it back to her for me.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.660
Are you crazy?

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:49.340
Isn't this mine? Why do you have it? It's broken.

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.810
I didn't do it.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.240
Does the new student representative have a grudge against you?

00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:02.090
<i>Good afternoon. My name's Jia Yichun, and I'm a 2016 new student from the Psychology Department.</i>

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:06.560
<i>I'm honored to give this speech as a representative of all the new students.</i>

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.940
Sorry, I almost made you lose half of your credit.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:14.210
It's okay, at least we still found it at the end with Cai Yasi's help.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.940
A genius computer youth is truly brilliant.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.960
Yeah, the process isn't important, the result is.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:24.820
It has also enabled students to form a clear plan of their future college life.

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:28.740
Look.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.130
This military training...

00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.080
<i>[Your speech is garbage]</i>

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.270
<i>- Who did this? <br>- How could this happen? <br>- This is unacceptable!</i>

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.100
Who did this?

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.220
- I don't know.<br>- It's so cool.

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.950
Xiao, what are you looking at?

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.590
Nothing.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.230
<i>If it's not him, then who is it?</i>

<i>[Preview]<br>Waiting for you who has literature accomplishments.</i>

<i>I came to find the programming club about finding the hacker.</i>

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.260
<i>I can help you investigate this hacker!</i>

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.720
<i>I've already thought of how we're going to find the hacker.</i>

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:26.220
<i>- They found the hacker!<br>- So, you really did it?</i>

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.220
<i>It wasn't her. You've misunderstood.</i>
