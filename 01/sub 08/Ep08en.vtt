<i>I think I've heard this before.</i>

<i>How about I treat you to a meal as a thank you?</i>

18
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.020
<i> - Sure. 
 - I'll come, too. </i>

<i>I know you didn't mean it. I didn't put it to heart. Don't worry about it.</i>

Good luck in the tournament, everyone.

Don't forget to be careful and not injure yourself during practice. Got it?

28
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.690
<i>- Got it.</i> 
 - What's happening? Big meeting?

- Hello. 
 <i>- Hello, Coach.</i>

30
00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.740
Hello.

31
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.640
Why are you here? Did you change your mind about participating?

32
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.560
I already told you I'm not interested in the tournament.

33
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.660
I'm just here to observe and show some love.

34
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.360
Since you're here, please help and coach these members.

35
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.800
Sure. Then...

36
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.940
Women's Singles,

37
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.390
leave them to me to coach.

38
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.460
Do you guys agree? Do you want to train with me?

39
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.060
Yes!

40
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.460
Let's let Zhu Lu go first.

41
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.260
Bring it on, Coach.

42
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.200
Then the rest of the members go practice.

43
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.100
Good luck on the interschool tournament.

44
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.160
<i>Good luck!</i>

45
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.040
Good pass.

46
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.990
<i> Good pass. Hit it towards the back. </i>

47
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.640
What is it?

48
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.250
<i> Fanzhou, I have a favor to ask you. </i>

49
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.340
Can you be our team doctor for the inter-school badminton tournament?

50
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.260
You should find someone from the medical department.

51
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.920
<i> Why look for a medical student? Isn't what we're learning similar to them?</i>

52
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.460
Also, you get the special scholarship every year. I'd rather have you instead.

53
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.710
<i>I'm not interested.</i>

54
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.360
I'm hanging up.

55
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.730
Hey—

56
00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.400
Fanzhou!

57
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.590
- Are you working here today? 
 - Yeah.

58
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.790
I'm here for an interview. My senior recommended me.

59
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.160
I knew you worked here, so I wanted to surprise you.

60
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.200
How was the interview?

61
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.560
The teachers all really liked me.

62
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.590
Do you guys know where the interview office is?

63
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.990
This room.

64
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.830
Thanks.

65
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.090
Fanzhou?

66
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.720
The interview results will be sent through text tomorrow.

67
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.530
You should go back and wait for the news.

68
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.130
Why is Zhou Xiao here?

69
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.700
I recommended her.

70
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.790
Why didn't you recommend me?

71
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.640
Because I like her.

72
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.170
So it's like that. Then I'll go back and wait for the news.

73
00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.350
<i> Why didn't you recommend me? </i>

74
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.720
<i> Because I like her. </i>

75
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.060
<i> It's fine. I didn't lose. </i>

76
00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.660
<i> As long as I stay by his side, </i>

77
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.350
<i> there will be a day when he remembers my good qualities. </i>

78
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.280
Good pass. Let's do a close one.

79
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.700
Good. One more. Good.

80
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.580
One more.

81
00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.140
Good pass. Let's do a close one.

82
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.550
Let's end it here. You've controlled most of the moves already.

83
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.600
But I can't get the backhand hit correctly.

84
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.840
There's still time tomorrow. I'll teach you again.

85
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.560
Just teach me today. I have a whole day to consolidate tomorrow.

86
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:03.250
Okay.

87
00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.670
Then let me demonstrate for you once more.

88
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.090
When you hit with your backhand, you used strength from your shoulder. Here.

89
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.140
Therefore, your whole arm rose.

90
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.500
But the correct way is to use your elbow joint

91
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.030
and direct it outwards.

92
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:21.320
Here.

93
00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:26.700
Correct. Just like a pendulum clock. Good. Understand?

94
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.230
I know I'm handsome, but stop looking at me. Look at your arm.

95
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.570
When did I look at you? I'm just afraid your spit will get on my face.

96
00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.850
You're obviously crazy about me. Here, I'll toss you the birdies.

97
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.450
Here, I'll keep tossing you birdies.

98
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.300
Good. Continue.

99
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.650
Good pass.

100
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:20.930
Again.

101
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.040
Let's continue.

102
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.520
Watch your wrist.

103
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.230
Good. Again.

104
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.590
Let's go from the bottom up. Come on.

105
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.760
Very good. Keep going.

106
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.850
Your backhand is pretty much fine now.

107
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.650
But it just doesn't have much force.

108
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.500
When we were younger and practiced backhand,

109
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.800
we used these water bottles and did the figure-eight motion. Like this.

110
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.030
Figure-eight motion?

111
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.390
Yes.

112
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.880
Stop turning. If you practice too much, haste brings no success.

113
00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:16.470
I just don't understand

114
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.670
how a pretty girl like you can still work so hard and endure hardship.

115
00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.720
I also didn't expect you to be so professional on the badminton field.

116
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.290
I'm quite curious

117
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.080
as to why you're not participating in this interschool tournament?

118
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.910
At first, I thought you despised this tournament's standards.

119
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.350
But then I heard you were afraid to lose against Southern Sports University's Li Xiaofeng.

120
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.960
But I don't think you're that type of person.

121
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.070
Li Xiaofeng, he's indeed someone in my badminton career

122
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:05.120
who I don't ever want to lose to.

123
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.800
Why?

124
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.980
Li Xiaofeng and I grew up training on our badminton team.

125
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:17.680
Later, we both worked hard to get into the city team. Our skills were always on par with each other.

126
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.450
We were always good friends and also doubles partners.

127
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.290
Later on, the province team came to the city team to pick members. Team doubles.

128
00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.210
He didn't tell me and teamed up with the person who's better than me.

129
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.190
What could I have done? I had to find someone last-minute.

130
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:38.310
In the end, he got in the province team and I didn't.

131
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.400
Don't look at me like that. I'm in the province team now, too.

132
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.800
Also, I beat him at the last National Badminton Championship.

133
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.700
What about this time?

134
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.650
After winning against him last time, my shoulder injury had a relapse.

135
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:03.750
Playing against him now, I probably wouldn't win.

136
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.930
If I really lose, I don't know how long I'd be trashed by him.

137
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.520
So the moral of the story is...

138
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.400
don't be partners with someone so easily.

139
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.530
Enough. I'm done resting; let's continue.

140
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:22.550
Again?

141
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.460
Let's go.

142
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.480
Last class, among those who turned in their Han Poem,

143
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.910
let me comment on some of them.

144
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.490
This, Luo Wei's

145
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:41.270
parallel poem and nostalgic poem.

146
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:45.850
It has a smooth writing style, natural rhyme, and is harmonious. I gave it ninety-five points.

147
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:49.210
With this level of yours, it's almost as good as the essays I wrote when I was eighteen.

148
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.600
Not bad.

149
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.750
This one I have to emphasize and read it aloud.

150
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.410
Zhou Xiao. The sao-style poem is a short poem.

151
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:03.190
"The sun is slanted, the clouds red. The spring wind is reluctant to softly pull at my clothes."

152
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.280
This sentence gave the spring wind a reluctance to let go, like humans.

153
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.560
It described liveliness. But I have a question.

154
00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.500
This short poem only had eleven characters.

155
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.570
Isn't it a little too short?

156
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.940
Among the three hundred Tang poems, the minimum amount was twenty characters. What happened to you?

157
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.890
Are you trying to challenge the Guinness record for Han poetry or are you trying to challenge your professor's bottom line?

158
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.180
Neither.

159
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.080
Lower your hands.

160
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.230
You look a little fat recently. Lower your hands.

161
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.580
You don't need to disregard your safety when you eat. Don't choke.

162
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.430
Write it again.

163
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.400
This, Liu Mingming, scattered poem.

164
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:51.020
It has exaggerating rhetoric, mediocre narrative, and a bit too long.

165
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.790
Long to the extent that there are two pages

166
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.190
where it's practically identical.

167
00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.020
- Did you use it as a stopgap? 
  <i> [From Southern University Campus Library]</i>

168
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.740
- If you want a stopgap... 
 <i>[Student Zhou Xiao, congratulations on passing your interview. You got the position at the library. Please report to the library at the start of your shift.]</i>

169
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:06.850
...you can go distribute it with Zhou Xiao.

170
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.190
Zhou Xiao.

171
00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:19.280
Did you all finish writing?

172
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.680
Even though the bell rang, I have a few more things to say.

173
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.630
What's the most important element of Han poetry? It's the rhythm.

174
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.850
Most importantly, why did the ancients in Han poetry

175
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:35.770
grasp the rhythm in this exact way?

176
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:39.470
You guys need to carefully research, repeatedly look over, and learn

177
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.180
this essence.

178
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.760
Thank you, Professor, I'm leaving.

179
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.320
Zhou Xiao.

180
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.080
Why are you here?

181
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.100
I'm helping the new co-workers familiarize with the new environment. Let's go.

182
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:25.670
The library is so people-oriented. They even set up people to help new employees.

183
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.230
Yeah.

184
00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:34.010
There's enough time.

185
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.980
This is the communication and transportation section.

186
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.590
This section has mostly major-related books.

187
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.470
This is the digital reading area.

188
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.550
This is the fiction section.

189
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.200
Military fiction novels.

190
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.770
Science fiction novels. Where are the detective novels?

191
00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.600
The detective novels are up ahead.

192
00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.940
I feel like every area looks the same.

193
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.740
Let's just stop here.

194
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.730
You have something to do?

195
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.180
I haven't eaten yet.

196
00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:24.330
Also, I have to watch my roommate's badminton tournament in the afternoon.

197
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.720
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

198
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.950
Let's go and eat. I'm also going to the badminton court.

199
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.400
Why are you going?

200
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:38.060
The badminton club's president wanted me to be their team doctor last-minute.

201
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.010
Okay then.

202
00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.500
Why are there no new comments?

203
00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.630
Comments?

204
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.780
The reader's comments. Let me tell you.

205
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.630
- The advice you gave me last time helped me a lot. 
 - <i> I'll go be your team doctor in a bit. </i>

206
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.110
After I edited it, I immediately got on the website's recommended list.

207
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:04.060
Readers and comments increased a lot. Thank you.

208
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.280
No problem.

209
00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.580
Oh right! There was one person who wrote a long comment. But he said something about

210
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:12.280
although the main character is so amazing, if he wanted to save lives, why didn't he become a doctor?

211
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.480
I think forensics is unique and a good topic of conversation.

212
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.800
Then, how did you reply?

213
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.690
I said, "Come, come!  You write it."

214
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.650
Then you might lose a reader.

215
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.800
It's okay. I have lots of readers. I still have fifty.

216
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:30.370
Let's stop talking and eat. The game is going to begin.

217

<i> The Fifth Interschool Badminton League</i>

218

<i> Women's Singles is beginning.</i>

219
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.710
<i> - A beautiful serve from Southern University's Zhu Lu.
 - Southern Sports University's Dai Feiyu is by no means inferior. </i>

220
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:47.810
<i> They're both fierce with power. Good pass. </i>

221
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.740
- Why isn't Zhou Xiao here yet? 
 - <i> Zhu Lu's backhand is skilled. Her body's capability...</i>

222
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.430
- She's here. 
 -<i> ...is better than Dai Feiyu. </i>

223
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.160
I see my roommates, I'm going.

224
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.760
<i> ...the difference is pretty big. </i>

225
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.010
How is Xiao Lu doing?

226
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.950
Xiao Lu's power is really fierce. I think we'll definitely win.

227
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:04.980
Most definitely.

228
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.580
<i>Good pass!</i>

229
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.600
Fanzhou, didn't you say you weren't coming?

230
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.510
Why did you suddenly message me you were coming?

231
00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.210
I'm here to be your team doctor.

232
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.110
Didn't you reject me? I was ready to do it myself.

233
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.180
- Then I'm leaving. 
 - Don't.

234
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.130
You came here at the perfect time. It's all in your hands now.

235
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.580
The medical box.

236
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:33.810
You guys are so loud. Watch the tournament. Good luck!

237
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.200
Good luck!

238
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.220
Good pass! Make her use her backhand!

239
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.640
Great. Good pass!

Xiao Dai!

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.360
Your racket is broken.

243
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.400
<i> Southern Sports University's Li Xiaofeng is looking impatient. You can see him calling for Dai Feiyu. He's probably giving her some guidance. </i>

244
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.900
Try hitting it towards the back.

245

<i> Xie Yixing is also using the time to guide Zhu Lu. Let us anticipate...</i>

246
00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.190
Don't worry. Focus on her wrist movements.

247
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:28.360
She might hit towards the back. Just block it.

248
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.410
Okay.

249
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.930
Good luck.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.400
How is it?

251
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.090
This star athlete gave her powerful guidance. I won't be wrong.

<i>With the guidance of star players, Zhu Lu and Dai Feiyu are displaying great passes.</i>

<i> Zhu Lu was too powerful and injured her foot when trying to catch the birdie. </i>

255
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:12.700
What happened to Xiao Lu?

256
00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.680
Is she okay?

257
00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:15.730
Are you okay?

Don't ask.

Put me down.

264
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:31.850
I still have to compete.

You're already like this, how are you going to keep playing?

When can Fang Wei do this? Forget it. He hugs his textbooks more intimately than me.

Enough talk. Let's go check on Xiao Lu.

Gently. She has delicate skin.

Xie Yixing, shut up.

He's so rough. He doesn't even understand how to show pity and love for women.

You're injured. You need to rest.

<i>And the crucial point is that he is displaying all of his abilities,</i>

313
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:55.630
<i>so that he can catch his opponent Li Xiaofeng off guard.</i>

314
00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:01.230
<i>An offensive player who doesn't make any mistakes. Moreover, this entire match is a breeze for him.</i>

315
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:06.460
<i>The score in front of our eyes is changing rapidly. The current score is 1 vs. 1. </i>

316
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.600
<i>Great shot!</i>

317
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.610
<i>The match is now entering its most intense stage.</i>

318
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.670
<i> [Southern University 7, Southern Sports University 6]</i>

319
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.020
Take that!

320
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.270
<i> [Southern University 20, Southern Sports University  16]</i>

321
00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.000
<i>A great hit from Xie Yixing. Nice shot. Victory has been decided with one shot.</i>

322
00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:19.580
<i>The winner of Men's Singles is Southern University.</i>

323
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:25.100
<i>From the results of the three rounds, the final champion of the Inter-school Badminton League is Southern University!</i>

324
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.700
<i>Congratulations to Southern University and their Badminton Club!</i>

325
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.190
You've worked hard.

326
00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.620
I initially wanted to look after you properly,

327
00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.130
but I couldn't win against my weakness for the charms of a beautiful woman.

328
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:38.570
Xie Yixing.

329
00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:45.920
What are you doing here? This is the men's changing rooms.

330
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.540
Are you here to see my muscles?

331
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.320
Who wants to look at you?

332
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.360
Then, what are you doing here?

333
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.790
I'm here to return your clothes.

334
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:08.060
Thank you.

335
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.120
There's no need to be polite.

336
00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.290
Is your shoulder okay?

337
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.720
It's fine. Athletes are all like this.

338
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.990
Are you sure?

339
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.040
Of course. I can even carry you like a princess if you want.

340
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:27.140
- Do you want me to show you? 
 - I don't want to be bothered by you. I'm leaving.

341
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:33.490
Xiao Lu, my muscles aren't in their best condition today.

342
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:38.380
Next time, when they're in a better condition, I'll invite you again.

343
00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.990
Your arm is injured. I'll have a look at it.

344
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.800
It's dislocated. Bear with me for a bit.

345
00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:29.850
Are you studying medicine?

346
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.780
Yes, I'm studying Forensic Science.

347
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:36.530
Forensic Science? You're studying Forensic Science and yet you're here as a doctor trying to s—

348
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:39.240
trying to save someone? Let go of me.

349
00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.800
Hey, I heard everything you said!

350
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.780
Since when can't a Forensic Scientist save someone?

351
00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:46.770
Have you never heard the phrase "If you can speak for the dead, you can defend the rights of the living"?

352
00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.720
You seem like the type that won't understand even after listening and won't ask if you don't understand.

353
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.150
I'll show you some mercy and just tell you.

354
00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:56.710
It means that returning the truth to the dead can also be a type of relief for the living.

355
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:59.110
Do you understand now? If you don't, go search it up when you get home.

356
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.800
Are you crazy? Where did you, a crazy woman, even come from? Believe me or not, I'll—

357
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.360
Believe what?

358
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.360
It hurts. I'm fine.

359
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.200
Let's go.

360
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.590
Wait a minute, let me get Xiao Lu's bag.

361
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:27.490
His shoulder...

362
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:29.670
It's back to normal.

363
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:32.590
Wow, so amazing.

364
00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.110
Take a step towards chasing your dreams.

365
00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.530
<i>Take a step towards chasing your dreams.</i>

366
00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:46.130
Beneath your feet is a complicated road; a thorny forest.

367
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.400
<i>Beneath your feet is a complicated road; a thorny forest.</i>

368
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.230
<i>The step forward has a high and dangerous peak and rapid waters.</i>

369
00:28:56.230 --> 00:29:00.030
<i>The step forward has a high and dangerous peak and rapid waters.</i>

370
00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:09.000
Wrong, as a cosplayer, we have to reach 100%.

371
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.120
99% doesn't count as being a cosplayer.

372
00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.410
Slowly hit it.

373
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:16.300
Don't tense your shoulders.

374
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.330
Don't shrug.

375
00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.810
Very good. Keep going.

376
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.820
Flatten your wrist. Steadily.

377
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:29.760
Xiao Lu and Cai Yasi both aren't picking up.

378
00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.830
It's not easy to hold a meeting for the Detective Club. None of them came.

379
00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.180
Looks like my detective club has no successors.

380
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.960
If I knew earlier no one was coming, I wouldn't have come either.

381
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:49.830
There's no use in glaring at me. With our talents, we can only eat chips as a performance for the school anniversary.

382
00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:53.770
Why don't you have any talents? Having you as a member is useless.

383
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.350
Without me, you won't even have someone to space out with you right now.

384
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.570
Besides, at least I came.

385
00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:02.900
Why don't you insult those who didn't show up?

386
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.860
Let me explain it to you. Cai Yasi needs to prepare for his speech,

387
00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.400
and Xiao Lu's badminton club might still be brainstorming, too.

388
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.070
And there's just Zhao Fanzhou left.

389
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.740
Zhao Fanzhou!

390
00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.890
Savior.

391
00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.950
Does anyone else have any suggestions regarding this year's school anniversary event?

392
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.430
This time the anniversary event is large-scaled.

393
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.920
Leaving it to only us few Student Association members, it might be less capable than desired.

394
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.650
How about letting some clubs not perform and have them be volunteers?

395
00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.620
How's that?

396
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.990
We can discuss this in detail.

397
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:45.700
But if there are too many volunteers, wouldn't it get messy?

398
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:48.070
<i> Are you not coming to the club activity? </i>

399
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.010
<i> We can't think of any ideas for the school anniversary performance. </i>

400
00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:54.330
<i> Our club is going to fall apart. </i>

401
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.730
Does anyone have any other thoughts about Chen Yu's suggestion?

402
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:07.900
If not, then the clubs who don't want to perform

403
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.030
can participate as volunteers for the event.

404
00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:13.170
But didn't you say to discuss it in detail?

405
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:16.720
The more the better. Isn't it better to have more helpers?

406
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.270
473, 474, 475,

407
00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:29.120
- 476, 477, 478, 
 - Look at this.

408
00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.280
- 479, 480! 
 - Send it to me.

409
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.380
481, 482, 483,

410
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.630
484, 485,

411
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:38.820
- 486. 
 - How many?

412
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.650
487, 488, 489,

413
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.160
- 489? 
 - 490, 491,

414
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.790
- 492, 493, 494, 
 - How many can he do?

415
00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:51.870
- Say it out loud. 
 - 495,

416
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:55.110
496, 497,

417
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:59.690
498, 499, 500. 
<i>[Zhou Xiao]</i>

418
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:04.840
Hello, Zhou Xiao? I was practicing earlier and didn't hear your call. Why did you call so many times?

419
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:09.510
<i> Xiao Lu, did your badminton club find something to perform? </i>

420
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.660
509, 510,

421
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.320
Bouncing the birdie.

422
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.460
513. 514.

423
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:18.360
Xie Yixing said he wants to

424
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.140
challenge the Guinness record for bouncing a birdie solo at the show.

425
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:26.030
<i> Guinness record? How many can he do? </i>

426
00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.220
I also want to know.

427
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.160
<i> Okay then. Bye-bye. </i>

428
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.160
Do you think...

429
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.340
it's reasonable to bounce the birdie in the air for a whole day for the school's anniversary?

430
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:45.410
It's reasonable. I'm not going on stage. I'll be bouncing it by myself on the side.

431
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:49.320
I know this badminton star's radiance might affect the performers on stage.

432
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.390
But don't worry. I will try my best to keep a low-profile.

433
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.500
Do you think this behavior has any significance?

434
00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.400
Yes.

435
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.670
Breaking the Guinness record on the school's anniversary

436
00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:05.100
is very significant.

437
00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.630
- Do you guys agree? 
 <i>- Yes!</i>

438
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.430
Exactly.

439
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.170
Okay. Suit yourself.

440
00:33:13.170 --> 00:33:15.980
I'll wait until the president gets back and make a decision.

441
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.720
There's no other way. Looks like this badminton star

442
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.560
will have to pull out his trump card.

443
00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.540
Thank you to the members for their long-lasting accompaniment. Thank you to the seniors for their help.

444
00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:36.230
Thank you to the professor for his care and guidance. My speech is done. Thank you, everyone.

445
00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.810
Yasi, you worked hard. Take a seat.

446
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.790
Your speech is important for the restructure of the ACM team members in training.

447
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:51.930
I think you could be more professional.

448
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.910
Talk about how programming will help with advancing humanity.

449
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.960
Also, can you talk more academically?

450
00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:04.380
Do you have glasses? It'll be better if you push up your glasses in between.

451
00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:07.010
Professor, I already corrected it three times.

452
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.160
Me going up and talking has already been five times.

453
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.130
This is called being cautious. Let me see it.

454
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.490
The middle part of this is actually not bad. You can move it ahead.

455
00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:27.570
Let me take a look and think about this.

456
00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.600
The last part...

457
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:34.260
<i> [Zhou Xiao: How is your speech? Are you done with it? Come over once it's done.]</i>

458
00:34:34.890 --> 00:34:39.080
This part is much better. You should have said it just now.

459
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.560
Professor, something came up. I have to go.

460
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.280
Send it to me when you're done editing it.

461
00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.600
I've already thought about it!

462
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.040
Look, look!

463
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.280
It's coming out, right?

464
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:59.250
Wait! Is it alive?

465
00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.630
What are you two yelling about?

466
00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:08.530
I thought we were here to discuss our performance for the school anniversary. Why are you watching a movie?

467
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:13.500
She said there was also a school anniversary in this movie, and we could look for inspiration.

468
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:17.650
Isn't this a horror movie? The school anniversary is not Halloween.

469
00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:22.250
Then you give us some ideas.

470
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:24.150
I don't know either.

471
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.020
Then, why did you come here?

472
00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:31.190
Three heads are better than one.
<i>(T/N: lit. three ignorant cobblers add up to a genius)</i>

473
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.550
All right. Tell us.

474
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.530
You could read a poem.

475
00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:48.000
"Southern University, you've been struggling ahead despite the wind and rain for a hundred years."

476
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.030
Even elementary students won't perform that now.

477
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.660
What about crosstalk? You and Tao Ling can perform one.

478
00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.110
You guys already sound like you're doing crosstalk when you guys talk. You'll definitely be able to pull it off.

479
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:02.070
Hello? Have you seen such a pretty crosstalk performer?

480
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.730
For Fang Wei's sake, I'm not going to refute back.

481
00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:07.560
Calm down. Calm down.

482
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.940
I knew we couldn't count on you.

483
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.310
Singing and dancing? Beat box?

484
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.640
Dragon or lion dance? What do you think?

485
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.100
You can also do backflips. Give me some reaction!

486
00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.270
♪ I can smile forever and be your supporting role ♪

487
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:33.590
♪ I can not ask about feelings and continue doing good things for love  ♪

488
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.870
- Not bad. 
 ♪ I can watch your arrogance with a cool detachment ♪

489
00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.560
You're back from your meeting?

490
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.960
Xie Yixing, why did you stop?

491
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.540
I'm tying my shoelaces.

492
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.640
Do you want to learn? It's really easy.

493
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:02.300
I think... you should teach Xiao Lu first.

494
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.880
I don't need to.

495
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.680
Here. I'll teach you.

496
00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.070
- I really don't need it.
- It's fine. I'll teach you.

497
00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.880
- Take it.
- I really don't need it.

498
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:15.210
I didn't use strength.

499
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.210
- It hurts.
- Then...

500
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.690
It hurts so badly.

501
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:25.700
I'm joking. Handsome boys aren't afraid of getting hurt. I'll teach you.

502
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.770
Let go.

503
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:29.490
I'm not going to.

504
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.270
Let go. What are you doing?

505
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:36.220
It's not like we didn't do this before. Why are you being shy?

506
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.840
Shut up. Go away.

507
00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.290
- Do you want to try?
- Okay.

508
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.270
This is the letter of undertaking regarding the safety of the venue.

509
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:06.290
This is the list of confirmed guests.

510
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.640
That's all. If I need confirmation on anything else then I'll look for you.

511
00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:19.140
Okay. I still have something to do so I'll get going.

512
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:24.170
Fanzhou, I will organize and give you the information from today's meeting.

513
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:28.390
I'll also help you organize the volunteer list Senior Chen Yu talked about.

514
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:30.730
Okay. You've worked hard.

515
00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.520
I just thought about it. Regarding the volunteers,

516
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:38.480
even though it's complicated, but if we have a clear division of labor

517
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.470
then it could help us a lot.

518
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.220
Okay. Then I'll list a detailed division of labor tasks.

519
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.420
Let me do it. I've already thought about it.

520
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.200
I was going to volunteer to do it just now.

521
00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.810
Can you handle it? Don't you also have to prepare to MC the show?

522
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.100
I can do it.

523
00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.050
I'll leave it to you then. I'll get going.

524
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.730
Bye-bye.

525
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.820
<i>I will try my best and prove to you that I'm the one who has the right</i>

526
00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.120
<i>to stand next to you.</i>

527
00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:22.330
Your other club member is here.

528
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:24.790
You're finally here.

529
00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.060
Have you come up with a performance for the school anniversary?

530
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.320
Not yet. I almost scratched all my hair off.

531
00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:53.770
Then go as a volunteer for the Student Association, you don't need to perform.

532
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.630
- Really?
- We just had a meeting and made the decision.

533
00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.140
I can finally watch the movie in peace.

534
00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.910
Do you hear that? We're about to watch the movie so please leave.

535
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.930
She doesn't have time to watch a movie.

536
00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.720
Why?

537
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.830
Did you forget we need to work overtime at the library?

538
00:40:12.830 --> 00:40:14.590
That's right.

539
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:18.970
You two take your time watching.

540
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:23.560
- Wait a second.
- I'm going to work hard for my life.

541
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.620
Wait a second!

542
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.970
Interesting. So interesting.

543
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.270
How is it interesting?

544
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:45.600
I'm not gloating. Are you still not going to admit I was right from the start?

545
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.260
As an old classmate, I'll advise you again.

546
00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:52.090
When the flower blooms, pluck it. Or else, you'll only get a branch when the flower is gone.
<i> (T/N: Idiom - Catch your chance before it's gone)</i>

547
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:55.930
If Zhou Xiao really gets taken by someone else, all you have left is to cry.

548
00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:02.370
You gave me a whole idiom.

549
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:05.210
Of course. I'm part of the Chinese Department.

550
00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.360
Why aren't you putting it on?

551
00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.690
Wait until the glue is half dry,  fill the seam, then smear again.

552
00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:03.250
Oh.

553
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.240
Did you learn it?

554
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.350
Pretty much.

555
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.180
Then give it a try.

556
00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.760
Okay.

557
00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:20.970
I'll do this one.

558
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.290
This belongs in the Precious Literature Room.

559
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:29.600
Someone got it wrong. We can't fix this.

560
00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.520
Precious Literature Room?

561
00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.130
Where is it?

562
00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:35.300
Go down over there to the level below.

563
00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.420
I'll go and bring it back to them.

564
00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:46.790
It's so quiet here.

565
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.790
It's the Precious Literature Room. Let's go in.

566
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.950
You can only enter the Precious Literature Room if you request it.

567
00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:55.180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

568
00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.770
You ran so fast. I didn't have time to say it.

569
00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.690
Is it that mysterious?

570
00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.420
How about we use our position and secretly go in?

571
00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.200
We can't.

572
00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.460
Professor Huang.

573
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.590
Zhao Fanzhou, you came just in time.
