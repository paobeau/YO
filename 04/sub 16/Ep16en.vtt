35
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.770
Actually, I originally did not want to come and disturb you.

36
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.290
It's just that my father found out from the emperor

37
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.760
that you are here to investigate a case.

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.900
He insisted on my coming here to meet you.

39
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.380
I was driven out of my home that very night.

40
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.550
I have nowhere to go now.

41
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.580
The Assistant Minister really found a good excuse,

42
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.280
but he might have to be disappointed.

43
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.740
You and I are not destined to fall in love at first sight.

44
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.820
I fear that there is also no opportunity to allow familiarity to breed fondness.

45
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.100
Sir, everyone in Tongling knows

46
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.220
that your fiancée has arrived in the county office.

47
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.310
Even approximating, it hasn't even been four hours,

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.970
and you already want to send me away.

49
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.020
How will others see me?

50
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.120
You are unmarried,

51
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.880
yet you are living in my residence.

52
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.640
How will others see me?

53
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.850
Is it about Adviser Tan?

54
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.950
From Adviser Tan's appearance, it doesn't seem like she can't be reasoned with.

55
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.320
Before, I didn't know the situation.

56
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.620
But now, I know.

57
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.430
Since you are willing to deal with me frankly,

58
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.890
you don't need to be reserved because of me.

59
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.960
Just act as if I do not exist.

60
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.990
My only wish is to find a temporary place to stay

61
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.410
to avoid receiving punishment from my father at home.

62
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.100
Fine.

63
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.770
Then you can temporarily live here.

64
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.680
Thank you, Sir.

65
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.380
Sir, if someone spreads a rumor to the capital,

66
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.540
I will also be in a difficult position.

67
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.370
Sorry to trouble you, Sir.

Who are you?!

71
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.960
Head Constable Zheng, you're awake.

72
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.100
I-I-I... I will go and pour you some water.

73
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.300
How are you?

74
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.450
What's the big deal? Didn't I just faint?

75
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.110
Did you really need to summon the physician?

76
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.370
This won't do. A nosebleed shouldn't cause you to faint!

77
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.470
You must let the physician examine you.

78
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.730
S-Sit down first.

79
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.190
Sit down quickly.

80
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.800
Wh-Why are you looking at me like that for?

81
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.620
You're acting naughty like a young girl.

82
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.820
Head Constable Zheng, have you been drinking alcohol frequently as of late?

83
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.240
Physician, you're already old,

84
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.000
can't you understand my suffering?

85
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.010
This is the age when love is confusing.

86
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.170
Only Du Kang can relieve me of thousands of worries. 
 <i>(T/N: According to legend, Du Kang invented wine)</i>

87
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.940
Then, Head Constable,

88
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.660
have you been regularly having nosebleeds recently?

89
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.760
Are your legs and feet occasionally weak,

90
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.960
and you also feel dizzy?

91
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.280
When it's serious, you can't even see clearly the objects in front of your eyes.

92
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.640
You really are a miracle-working physician. Miracle-working!

93
00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.030
Physician, how is he?

94
00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.270
What could it be? Isn't it that I'm in the prime of my youth

95
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.460
so my liver is inflamed? Right, physician?

96
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.880
- Your body is sturdy. 
 - That's right.

97
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.460
But within, there are many poisons that are clashing against one another.

98
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.390
Furthermore, with the needle prick on your wrist,

99
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.230
you aren't treating an illness,

100
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.170
instead, it appears that you are testing poison for someone.

101
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.770
Physician, you... should leave me your details.

102
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.640
On another day, I will bring my beloved to be treated by you.

103
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.040
Head Constable, you must not joke around.

104
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.330
For the time being, take care of yourself.

105
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.810
If you continue to act recklessly, the least severe situation will be that you will lose your eyesight.

106
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.240
If it is more serious, you may lose your life.

107
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.580
Is it really that serious? You physicians

108
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.100
all love to scare people.

109
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.580
Physician, are there any methods that can be used to treat him?

110
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.700
I will first prescribe some medications to help him recuperate.

111
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.150
If he continues to act recklessly, no medicine can save him.

Everything about her is good,

You better take care of yourself first.

A person's life and death are ruled by fate.

How could Tang Tianyuan come to a small place like this?

136
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.780
Afterward, Miss Jiang said

137
00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.900
Tang Feilong is Tang Tianyuan's pseudonym.

138
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.670
Is what you just said really true?

139
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.470
Of course, it's true.

140
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.380
Quicker than words could say, I rushed forward

141
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.720
and caught Adviser.

142
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.170
At the time, Adviser was trembling

143
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.800
and then weeping.

144
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.800
She was incredibly heartbroken.

145
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.590
Heavens! Our county magistrate is actually an imperial envoy!

146
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.560
Such an important government official concealed his identity and came here.

147
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.850
That's right. Do you think that the emperor will have heard of me, Zhao Xiaoliu?

148
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.240
Wait a minute. Since he came with his identity concealed,

149
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.800
why would he let Miss Jiang disclose his identity and not continue to hide?

150
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.100
Could it be that he has already solved the gold case and simply hasn't told us?

151
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.400
What are you worrying about this for? Let me tell you!  We must work properly right now.

152
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:42.760
If Sir Tang is in a good mood, he'll bring us all to the capital.

153
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:47.100
It's too late. It's too late. With people like us,

154
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.170
he figured us out long ago.

155
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:54.500
After Miss Jiang takes Sir Tang back to be married, who will still remember us?

156
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.260
At that time, our careers as officials will have no prospects

157
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.700
and we will not be able to get married or have a family.

158
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:03.400
This won't do! Think about it. Sir

159
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:09.000
and our adviser are a couple made by Heaven and arranged by Earth. Right?

160
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.200
That's right. We must work as one with the adviser.

161
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.110
Isn't that right?

162
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.050
- Miss Jiang. 
 - Miss Jiang.

163
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.900
Miss Jiang, what are you looking for?

164
00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.400
It's nothing. I'm just having a look around.

165
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.660
- I'll take you around to have a look. 
 - All right.

166
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.150
Here, this is where Sir—

167
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:39.400
Miss Jiang, you are a golden branch with jade leaves. Right?
 <i>(T/N: A noble and beautiful lady)</i>

168
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.350
You're definitely not accustomed to the lifestyle of old men like us.

169
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.310
Wouldn't it be better if you go back a bit sooner?

170
00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:51.230
This way, our Adviser Tan will also not be delayed in her work.

171
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.840
Wha... What are you doing? I'm married!

172
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.600
How could you wear a damaged uniform?

173
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:04.400
I...I... Y-Y-You...

174
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.910
Don't even think about using this to c-c-complain to Sir Tang!

175
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.790
Then asking him to p-p-punish me for negatively affecting the appearance of our county.

176
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:14.620
We're just three rough men! Even our underwear has holes.

177
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.750
If you want to punish... punish all of us!

178
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.080
Take it off. I'll fix it for you.

179
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.990
- You go. 
 - Yes, Miss.

180
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.930
What? This...

181
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.500
Brothers, you usually work hard investigating for Sir Tang.

182
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.480
I don't have many skills but I'll be staying here for a while.

183
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.860
I can conveniently do these small tasks and help everyone

184
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.040
in order to express my gratitude.

185
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.790
Leave this to me!

186
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.990
Miss Jiang, my underwear!

187
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:54.800
What underwear!

188
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.990
She said she could mend them.

189
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.400
Fix it yourself!

190
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.730
- You fix it for me! Let's go! 
 - You want me to fix it?

191
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:03.940
Why should I fix it?

192
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.650
Cong Shun, you've been coughing recently.

193
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.900
Drink some honeysuckle tea to soothe your throat.

194
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.940
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

195
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.410
Brothers,

196
00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.370
is the food and drink good enough?

197
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.940
The pastry made by Miss Jiang is not only tasty

198
00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.100
but most importantly,

199
00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:30.400
doesn't come with stomachache!

200
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.760
Please eat more.

201
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.880
Okay!

202
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.640
Xiao Die, take care of everyone. Brothers, help yourselves.

203
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.420
Okay.

204
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.860
Adviser, come here. Come here and try some!

205
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.240
Over here.

206
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.880
Adviser, these here were all handmade by Miss Jiang.

207
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.190
Look! Mung bean cake... Osmanthus wine! This is chestnut cake.

208
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.700
Here, try one.

209
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:11.650
Eating so many sweets all in one go... be careful it doesn't stick in your throat!

210
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:17.070
You're here, Adviser Tan. Try some of the food I made.

211
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.810
It's delicious.

212
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:30.430
I mean, it's okay.

213
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:32.100
Lingyin.

214
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:39.020
Sir. Sir—

215
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:51.160
Why are you Tang Tianyuan?

216
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.770
My parents chose my name.

217
00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.500
Why didn't I know?

218
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.840
Because I didn't tell you.

219
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.310
Then, why didn't you tell me?

220
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.110
I was wrong.

221
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.710
Tan Lingyin, I concealed my identity for a reason.

222
00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.660
I didn't lie to you on purpose.

223
00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.220
Then hurry up and tell me why you did that!

224
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.630
I had a pseudonym... because—

225
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:25.170
Tang Feilong! No, Tang Tianyuan.

226
00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.900
You knew I really idolized Tang Tianyuan and you clearly had plenty of time to tell me,

227
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.630
but you refused to tell me anything.

228
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.510
Did you just want to embarrass me?

229
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:41.750
When I made up stories about Tang Tianyuan in front of you, you must have been pleased.

230
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:43.590
I wasn't!

231
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.370
I felt the opposite. Every time you mentioned Tang Tianyuan,

232
00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.770
I was always jealous.

233
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.700
Even though that person is me.

234
00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.650
Don't tell me these things, I won't believe you.

235
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.510
The emperor sent me to Tongling to investigate the gold case.

236
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:10.980
I worked under an alias so that those criminals could let down their guard.

237
00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.410
I lied to everyone, not just you.

238
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.450
That... That was because we didn't know each other well in the beginning.

239
00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:25.100
Why didn't you tell me later?

240
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.800
You can constantly find yourself in danger because you work as my adviser.

241
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.810
If I told you my true identity, wouldn't you be in even more danger?

242
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.410
I bet you just think I'm stupid. You're afraid that I'll reveal your secret.

243
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:42.080
You care more about gold than me.

244
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.750
There were a few times I wanted to tell you,

245
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.710
but I was afraid.

246
00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:55.950
I was afraid... afraid you wouldn't understand me,

247
00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.200
wouldn't trust me, and therefore leave me.

248
00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.440
What about Miss Jiang?

249
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.590
Those are my parents' wishes. They didn't ask for my permission.

250
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.280
Then, why is she still here?

251
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.200
If I told her to leave now, what will others think?

252
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.230
<i>[Hall of Justice and Integrity]</i>

253
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.100
Court adjourned!

254
00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.200
It must be here. Excuse me, 
 <i>[Medicinal Hall]</i>

255
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.880
is this where I queue to see the miracle healer from the capital?

256
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.650
Yes, can't you see all these people in the queue?

257
00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.350
Excuse me for being rude but what skills does this miracle healer have?

258
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.900
You've asked the right person. Let me tell you.

259
00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:42.400
I heard this doctor specializes in using poison to combat poison.

260
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.610
It's more fitting to call him a poison doctor.

261
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.000
This awesome? I've found a cure now!

262
00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.830
You are not sick.

263
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:57.010
I am not the one who is sick.

264
00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.030
I am helping a friend get medicine.

265
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:03.610
She... has frequent palpations, gets dizzy,

266
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.860
and every once in a while she suffers unbearable pain all over.

267
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.840
Also, she frequently has insomnia and nightmares.

268
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.100
If I can't see her in person, it'll be difficult to treat her.

269
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.370
You can use me to experiment.

270
00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.560
Prescribe the treatment and try it on me. If it's good then I can use it on her.

271
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.010
I can't afford to do that. Please leave.

272
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.980
It's all written here. If I die, you can't be held responsible.

273
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.710
All right then.

274
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:44.030
I specialize in using poison to combat poison.

275
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.570
Get this scorpion to bite you.

276
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.160
Based on the symptoms you have described,

277
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.020
your body is probably filled with fiery poison.

278
00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.290
Once you get bitten, you are guaranteed to feel refreshed and remedied.

279
00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.060
N-No.

280
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:05.220
This... is it believable?

281
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.750
You don't believe me? Next!

282
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.360
No-No! I believe you!

283
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.530
I will do it right now. Try it.

284
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.560
Stop!

285
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.160
Please spare me, Miss. I didn't do anything.

286
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.520
You fraud! How dare you sit here and kill people with poison.

287
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:36.630
Miss Ruyi, he's not a fraud. He's a miracle healer.

288
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.410
Look out the door. There are lots of people queuing to see him.

289
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:44.580
That is all fake. How can a scorpion cure a disease? Is your brain broken?

290
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.650
How dare you!

291
00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.410
- You dared to trick me? 
 - Please spare me, Sir!

292
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.040
I-I-I just wanted to earn a l-little money.

293
00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.710
Stop your nonsense! You will come with me to the county office right now!

294
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.530
Head Constable Zheng!

295
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:07.350
Miss Ruyi, do you have something else you want to tell me?

296
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:12.460
If you have spare time, you can come and find me in Miaosheng Restaurant.

297
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:15.060
That's great!

298
00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.100
Then I will leave first.

299
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.800
Let's go!

300
00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.090
<i>- Sir! Is that the girl you were talking about? 
 - Hurry!</i>

301
00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.210
Miss Jiang look at the clothes you patched up for me.

302
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:30.290
It's amazing!

303
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:31.630
I can't even tell it was patched.

304
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.380
<i>That's right.</i>

305
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.570
<i>- Are there any other holes? 
- No!</i>

306
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.450
<i>Then that's great. You're welcome.</i>

307
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.560
From now on, you can give me all your clothes to patch.

308
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.940
Okay. Thank you, Miss Jiang.

309
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.710
Our Lady is really talented!

310
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.300
Is that right?

311
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.860
Your Lady is incredible.

312
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.440
Of course.

313
00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.900
Miss Jiang.

314
00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:00.480
Let's go.

315
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.640
Your Lady is not only pretty but her embroidery is also impressive.

316
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.940
- Is it pretty? 
 - Pretty!

317
00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.450
<i>Miss Jiang, your embroidery is so beautiful.</i>

318
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.120
<i>Later, can you embroider a flower on my clothes?</i>

319
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.400
<i>- Okay. 
 - Can you also add two more birds and cranes!</i>

320
00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:22.250
Adviser Tan, your room sure is messy.

321
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.640
In the whole county office, only your room is the same as Dawang's.

322
00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.770
A horrid mess!

323
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.130
Look at this.

324
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.060
How long has this apple core been here? I bet it's rotten.

325
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.500
What a waste for the planter Sir gave you.

326
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.200
Xiang Gua, just stop.

327
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.920
Adviser, shall we clean up for you later?

328
00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.720
No need. I can clean myself.

329
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.620
Okay. Then we won't bother you anymore.

330
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:01.430
Xue Li, what can Adviser be doing?

331
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:06.530
Miss Jiang is the one outside patching everyone's clothes.

332
00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:10.590
Adviser is writing. Let me see what you are writing.

333
00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.180
"Ling'er jumped off from the stage and fell into Tang Feilong's arms."

334
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.630
"She says sweetly, 'I want you to hold me for a bit'."

335
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.220
Xue Li, tell me what kind of writing is this?

336
00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.980
This is my afternoon break, I can do whatever I want.

337
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.620
If you want to laugh at me, then leave!

338
00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.260
The saying goes "humans live for a breath, Buddha lives for incense." 
 <i> (T/N: one must prove themselves)</i>

339
00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.410
Tang Tianyuan is the dream lover for thousands of girls.

340
00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.230
Why would he like you?

341
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:50.480
Just stop. Let's go.

342
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.760
Adviser, she just says whatever she wants. Don't mind her.

343
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.910
You are all bullying me!

344
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.770
Get down.

345
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:15.110
I don't want to. Just for a little while.

346
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:17.460
I can't contain the excitement in my heart.

347
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.090
My feet feel light. I feel like I'm floating to Heaven!

348
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.530
You have to hold onto me tightly!

349
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.430
Your lover has come back?

350
00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.380
Your lover is also back.

351
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.620
Where are you going?

352
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:31.350
Don't talk to me.

353
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:33.680
Your lover is angry.

354
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.880
She knows that I am Tang Tianyuan.

355
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:42.920
I'm so sorry! So sorry!

356
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.530
Then why don't you explain it to her?

357
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:48.410
I already did. It didn't work.

358
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:50.690
She doesn't want me to bother her today.

359
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.220
What about the matter I asked you to investigate? Any progress?

360
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:58.020
I already investigated it. It is true that a lot of impure gold has appeared in the market.

361
00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.070
It's all from the same pawn shop.

362
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.940
But the people at the pawnshop probably aren't who you are looking for.

363
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:06.140
Let's go take a look.

364
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.030
You gained weight.

365
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.880
I gained weight?

366
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.230
<i>Please come again!</i>

367
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:19.680
Shopkeeper Wen, I'm back again.

368
00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.250
Sir Tang. Head Constable Zheng.

369
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:25.280
Recently, has there been someone coming frequently to exchange impure gold?

370
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.730
Yes. But I've already explained to Constable Zheng.

371
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:34.780
That person wraps himself up well. I can't tell what they look like.

372
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.820
It's fine. Their figure won't change.

373
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.470
Take a look at these two, who does it look like?

374
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.370
I remember that person is skinnier

375
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:54.820
and looks young. So it isn't this middle-aged person. It should be him.

376
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.020
I heard from the servants from the Sun family say that the day they were robbed,

377
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.570
someone unveiled the robber's mask during the fight.

378
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:12.930
They said it was a middle-aged man. He looked like Sang Jie's housekeeper, Old Tie.

379
00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.210
Old Tie?

380
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.220
So Old Jin is Old Tie.

381
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.750
Sun family's housekeeper?

382
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:27.250
Correct. After Sang Jie died, they disappeared without a trace. We don't know if they're alive or not.

383
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:31.710
It looks like they're alive and well. They're likely to be rich, too.

384
00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:37.590
So if the person exchanging the gold is Old Tie,

385
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:42.600
then the bandit who robbed the Sun family is also Old Tie.

386
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:46.590
Are these two groups the same and are partners in crime?

387
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.550
So after helping Sang Jie mine gold,

388
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.770
they went to Phoenix Mountain to become outlaws?

389
00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:54.180
That's correct.

390
00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:00.620
<i>[Miaosheng Restaurant]</i>

391
00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.400
Wife, why aren't you eating? Do you not like them?

392
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.390
I asked the chef to make this especially for you.

393
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:21.060
Is the food in the county office not good?

394
00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:24.530
How about I personally deliver food to you tomorrow?

395
00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.950
That's not it. My heart feels empty.

396
00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.690
- Can you get me a bowl of soup? 
 - Sure.

397
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.800
Wife, did someone upset you?

398
00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.830
Is it Tang Feilong?

399
00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.270
I knew it. Since you are not saying anything, it must be him!

400
00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:03.990
I'm going to go settle the score with him right now!

401
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.230
Leave it. Are you going to bang the drum to voice your grievance?

402
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.060
I just want to eat in peace right now.

403
00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.680
Wife,

404
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.240
if Tang Feilong bothers you again in the future,

405
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.430
I will make sure he knows the consequences of bothering you.

406
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:29.760
Since my wife wants to eat, I'll stay here and eat until you're satisfied.

407
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.230
Zhu Dacong, you're quite loyal.

408
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.780
Why don't you... give up on marrying me?

409
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.320
What do you think about us becoming sworn sisters?

410
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.660
I wholeheartedly want to marry you,

411
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.580
yet you see me as a good sister. You can't do that!

412
00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:04.130
I can't be sad at home. Qingchen will be worried.

413
00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:09.870
I can't be emotional at the county office either. The gold case is more important right now.

414
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.910
If we turn the office upside down because of relationship problems,

415
00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.610
it will definitely interfere with Sir Tang's work.

416
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:18.340
I understand.

417
00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.530
Once a person falls in love with someone,

418
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.330
who wouldn't be affected by a third party?

419
00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:34.430
But have you put yourself in their shoes?

420
00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.450
Miss Jiang and I are the same.

421
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.840
We're both what you would call someone with feelings

422
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.350
who is pitiful because they've been abandoned.

423
00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.330
But you can't control feelings.

424
00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:55.760
If it can be controlled, who would choose to be pitiful?

425
00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.100
It is great that you both found true love.

426
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:05.130
But should it be so offensive for us to like you two?

427
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:13.270
Why are we the ones who are laughed at? Looked down at?

428
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:21.360
I'm the son of a prefectural magistrate. Miss Jiang comes from a military family.

429
00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:28.520
We are chasing after you two without face or dignity.

430
00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:35.140
Isn't it just to ask you lovers to

431
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:40.680
occasionally think of us and give us a little sympathy

432
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.030
and a little hope?

433
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.150
Dacong, I was very clear with you from the beginning.

434
00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.900
I understand.

435
00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.890
I didn't say this to get a response from you,

436
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.940
but because I hope you can understand Miss Jiang's feelings.

437
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:08.760
Did you know that each time you rejected me,

438
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.110
I felt upset.

439
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:20.370
I know. You think that I'm attention seeking and acting.

440
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:27.680
But I also understand that however much I felt upset then

441
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.010
is however upset Miss Jiang will be when she's rejected.

442
00:30:31.010 --> 00:30:34.060
Besides, she's also a woman.

443
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.700
I'm not going to say more. I can only blame myself for liking you.

444
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:44.290
It's my fault. I'll punish myself.

445
00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.080
I just wanted to have a simple meal with you today.

446
00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.400
Never mind. I'm going to take a walk outside.

447
00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:01.170
I'll go with you as it's late.

448
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.870
There's no need.

449
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.070
Come in.

450
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.410
<i>[Esteemed virtue]</i>

451
00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.870
Why are you here?

452
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:28.740
Sir, I used the silk I brought to make everyone some new pillowcases.

453
00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:31.100
I've given them to everyone.

454
00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.370
I thought you wouldn't like the colorful flowery patterns

455
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:37.880
so I picked plain ones for you.

456
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.450
Please don't blame me for making the decision.

457
00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:44.110
By the way, Xiang Gua said there's a pharmacy near here.

458
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:48.240
Tomorrow, I'll buy some dates that can nourish the liver and clear the mind

459
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.050
to put into the pillow.

460
00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:53.470
I see how hard you work during the day.

461
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.300
It's important that you sleep well so you have energy the next day.

462
00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:01.070
You can just leave these things for the two servants in the yard to do.

463
00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.410
It's nothing.

464
00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:06.800
The servants are astute but there's too much stuff to do here.

465
00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.390
They don't have time to do these detailed tasks.

466
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.000
I don't have other stuff to do anyway.

467
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.990
- I'll change them for you. 
 - No need.

468
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:17.950
Just leave it there.

469
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.780
Okay.

470
00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:33.890
Sir, I have something to ask you.

471
00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.120
Go ahead and ask.

472
00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.550
Why am I not adequate?

473
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.960
Then I would like to ask Miss Jiang,

474
00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:01.440
Is "adequate" good enough when we're talking about marriage?

475
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.920
But women are supposed to obey their fathers at home,

476
00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.830
then obey their husbands once they're married.

477
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:12.930
Moreover, the marriage offer has already been sent from the Tang family to the Jiang family.

478
00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:17.200
Since then, I can only treat you as my world

479
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.660
and ignore everything else.

480
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:25.420
Is this your father's wish or your wish?

481
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.700
Are you talking about me coming to Tongling?

482
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.070
I just want to get the truth from you today.

483
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.940
If I have shortcomings or if there's anything I'm doing wrong,

484
00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.020
please let me know.

485
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.780
I'll change everything that is possible to change.

486
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.190
If it's not possible, I'll still change, even in exchange for my life.

487
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:57.370
If you're not ready to get married right now,

488
00:33:57.370 --> 00:34:02.130
I‘ll just stay by your side and help you do things here and there.

489
00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.930
Besides that, I won't ask for more.

490
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:10.200
You said last night that you were kicked out of the house.

491
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:14.630
Tongling is my only hope.

492
00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:22.950
Miss Jiang,

493
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.850
it's not that you can't,

494
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:31.300
it's that besides her, no one else can.

495
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.520
It's getting late. Head back to rest,

496
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.530
in case anyone starts spreading rumors.

497
00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:09.280
Sir Tang stayed here to investigate the gold case. That's why he hid his identity.

498
00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.530
How did Miss Jiang find out?

499
00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:16.370
Does she also know about the gold case?

500
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.050
But if she knows...

501
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.760
why would she choose to get involved?

502
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.820
Is marrying someone more important than staying alive?

503
00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:48.270
<i>[Phoenix Village]</i>

504
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.740
Who are you!

505
00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:14.660
Why would you hit someone who's already blind?

506
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:16.530
I treat all perverts equally.

507
00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.220
Who are you? Why did you capture me?

508
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.320
This is Phoenix Village.

509
00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.820
Why do you think we captured you?

510
00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:26.780
T-To become the wife of the Village Head?

511
00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:29.400
From now on, you

512
00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.210
can plunder people and eat delicacies with us.

513
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:37.130
You'll become the female leader of this mountain. Are you happy?

514
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.800
Why would I be happy?

515
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.780
Okay, okay, okay.

516
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:53.710
I just knew that one day my beauty would endanger my life!

517
00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.020
Oh my god!

518
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.660
She has the guts to say she's pretty in front of me?

519
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:04.340
Little girl, do you have some misunderstandings about yourself?

520
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.670
But her personality is quite similar to me when I was younger.

521
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.520
Very confident!

522
00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.470
You two are not sleeping in the middle of the night. Why are you here to see my wife instead?

523
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.330
- I... 
 - Let's go!

524
00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.450
It's you!

525
00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:26.880
Long time no see. My name's Duan Feng. I'm your husband.
