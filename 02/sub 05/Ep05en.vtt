<i>When My Love Blooms</i>

2
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.480
I think that to those who survived, there is a reason for their living.

3
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.590
That it's because there are things that only you can do in this world.

4
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.710
So you being alive may be a blessing to us.

5
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.370
So Ji Soo, you can do it all.

6
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.710
You can rest, you can cry.

7
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.010
If you're having a hard time, you don't have to grit your teeth and endure it.

8
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.380
Because I'll be by your side.

9
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.000


10
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.660
Why would you be by my side?

11
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.380
I should be in my place, and you should be in your place.

12
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.960
That's right.

13
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.890
Anyone would know that this was just an escape.

14
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.830
And even for a first love, we cannot justify an inappropriate relationship.

15
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.520
But why can't I turn away from you?

16
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.400
Why can't I leave us in my memories?

17
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.210
I kept thinking about it.

18
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.910
And I found that the answer was in our past.

19
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.010
You said this.

20
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.070
Your belief,

21
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.430
your world is me.

22
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.370
There was something I couldn't say at the time.

23
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.140
To me, you were my dream.

24
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.500
Now that I'm again facing the dream I had lost,

25
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.890
I find myself unable to either throw it away

26
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.210
or run away.

27
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.460
Because that's what a dream is.

28
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.760
Because it's a dream.

29
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780
Because you'll wake up from it soon.

30
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.520
I have to go now.

31
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.350
Sunbae.

32
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.810
Hm?

33
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:18.140
I'm sorry for ruining the mood, but I'm really cold and hungry.

34
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.720
Yoon Ji Soo, are you mad?

35
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.330
Are you?

68
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.180
Is this seonji (clotted cow blood)?

69
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.080
Yes.

70
00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:47.010
So they're like those squashy blood clots that form when you get a bloody nose?

71
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.560
People are so cruel.

72
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.100
How can they even take the blood clots out of a cow and eat them?

73
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.930
You're not eating it? It's tasty.

74
00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.610
I'm good.

75
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.600
Do they have this in Seoul too?

76
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.480
I'll buy it for you there.

77
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.510
It's so good.

78
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.580
Sunbae.

79
00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.430
Weren't we kind of lovely back then?

80
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.280
No. We were really, very lovely.

<i>Episode 5</i>

83
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.660
Head back home safely.

84
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:19.520
Ji Soo, I was sincere yesterday, when I said that I would be by your side.

85
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.110
It's just a dream.

86
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.030
It's all just a dream. I've woken up from it already.

87
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:30.640
- So, you too— 
 - I'm not saying we should start something again.

88
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.900
I just want to be able to protect you so that you don't cry again.

89
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.250
Don't worry.

90
00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:42.080
I cry in dreams, but I don't cry easily in reality.

91
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.510
Then don't cry. If you cry, I'll come find you.

92
00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.660
Well, that sounds like a threat.

93
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.310
Rest well.

94
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.670
Where is Seo Kyeong?

95
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.960
Ah. She hasn't come in yet.

96
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:58.770
You're here? Come in.

97
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:01.370
I have to leave soon because I have a movie shoot.

98
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.270
When is it?

99
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:05.590
Around three?

100
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.410
Can you not do that? I feel uncomfortable with all those girls there.

101
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.670
Are they even women?

102
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.800
I'll pay you instead.

103
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.320
But, I'm not doing it because of the money.

104
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.420
Then why are you doing it?

105
00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.150
Well, just for self-realization?

106
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.040
What is this. High school?

107
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.240
I'll see you next time.

108
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.020
Wait a second.

109
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.340
- Buy what you need. 
- I'm fine.

110
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.730
You're not fine.

111
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:41.330
Your bag doesn't look that great. Throw it away.

112
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.960
Yes, Chairman.

113
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.500
<i>Where are you?</i>

114
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:53.990
I'm home.

115
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.500
<i>Then come over for a bit.</i>

116
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.100
Yes. I understand.

117
00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.550
Are preparations for the government inspection going well?

118
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.960
Yes.

119
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.200
I heard they're all with bloodshot eyes,

120
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.350
pondering whether they should eat you roasted or boiled.

121
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.070
It is alright.

122
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:21.200
Well, the guys at the National Assembly live for the thrill of making a scene out of things, after all.

123
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:27.070
Just bow your head a bit and butter them up by addressing them as "Esteemed Assemblyman."

124
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.230
You get it right?

125
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.910
Yes, I understand.

126
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.670
But why is Seo Kyeong acting this way again?

127
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.460
I told you to take care of it, did you not?

128
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.150
You're not afraid of me, are you?

129
00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:46.300
I'm afraid of myself.

130
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.960
When it comes to my kids, I can't really control my temper, you see.

131
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.260
If you make my kid cry because you are giving her a hard time,

132
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.120
that is the day you'll leave this house.

133
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.370
You will have to leave in just your underwear.

134
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:06.490
Will you be okay with that?

135
00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.650
- Yes?  
 - <i>Vice President.</i>

136
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:23.040
- Yes. 
- <i>Right now, millions of won are being paid </i>

137
00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.760
<i> every couple of minutes with CEO Jang's corporate card.</i>

138
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.700
From where?

139
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:31.040
<i> From luxury brand shops within a department store.</i>

140
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.140
How dare you come here?

141
00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:42.160
I thought it was a sign for me to come.

142
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.250
Were you with that woman?

143
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.170
"I'm in pain, I'm so pitiful."

144
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.100
"Don't worry, I'll protect you."

145
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.910
Showing a face full of pity for her.

146
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.810
Have you properly filmed your soap opera?

147
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.450
You're drunk.

148
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.510
But you do know, right? That I've also been with another man.

149
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.710
We are tied.

150
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.790
So don't take it more seriously than it actually is.

151
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:35.770
This kind of stuff is nothing.

152
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:41.580
You and I are overloaded with stress,

153
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.300
and so we look for something to divert ourselves.

154
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:52.140
It is not a lesser deal nor a bigger deal than that.

155
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.110
Don't you think?

156
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.840
Yes Manager.

157
00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.770
It's such a shame. I really liked you.

158
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.770
Well, there's nothing we can do. This happened because I couldn't control my temper.

159
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:09.920
But it was refreshing to see. Just like drinking a sip of cool soda.

160
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:15.100
But, that is, how much would that sip of soda cost?

161
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.500
Pardon?

162
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.730
The clothes.

163
00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.160
I'll find out and contact you.

164
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.990
Then, will you move to a different hotel?

165
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:29.150
Please let me know ahead of time so I can follow you there.

166
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:35.290
I'm really not sure where I should go now.

167
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:36.650
Stay strong.

168
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:41.660
You live so diligently, so better days should come sooner than you think, no?

169
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:48.060
Better days and a better world don't seem to be coming.

170
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.610
Even though I thought  they would come soon.

171
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.430
Don't ever do it again.

172
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:45.100
Don't ever hold someone else's hand in front of me and leave.

173
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.500
You already know why I'm acting this way.

174
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:27.410
Why are you being so harsh, when you can't even lift a finger.

175
00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.170
Do you think you're still a tiger, Dad?

176
00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.470
You can't run away from home.

177
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.610
You told me to fight, though.

178
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.270
How is running away considered fighting?

179
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.770
I'm no match to them.

180
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.070
I'll go with you.

181
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.020
You're no match for them either.

182
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:53.610
Then what do you want to do? Never see them again?

183
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.090
I don't want that, but I think today really isn't the right time.

184
00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.770
If it's not today, then tomorrow won't be the right time either.

185
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:03.410
No.

186
00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.020
I have something I would like to ask.

187
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.300
Why are you treating Ji Soo so harshly?

188
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.880
Am I required to explain that to you?

189
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:21.070
Honestly, I don't think that I would be able to understand whatever reason you tell me.

190
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.960
I also don't think I would be able to contain myself even if you said she was hit with a flower.

191
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:35.980
A warm prosecutor looking after the marginalized ones who have no power nor strength.

192
00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.390
A fair prosecutor who only pursues the truth.

193
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.530
A trustworthy prosecutor who earns the trust and understanding of others.

194
00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.050
A righteous prosecutor who is more harsh on himself than others.

195
00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.980
While swearing that prosecutor's oath,

196
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.120
amongst all the prosecutors that swear an oath to justice,

197
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.330
you are at the highest position.

198
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:56.720
Please treat Ji Soo with warmth. I beg you.

199
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.610
Did you say you're in the Department of Law?

200
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.970
Yes.

201
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.570
Are you preparing for the judicial examination?

202
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.000
I have been thinking about it.

203
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.770
Is it because of your discretion or your principles?

204
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.940
Though you seem to be lacking in both.

205
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:35.230
Leave now. I don't want to hear from you nor see you anymore.

206
00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.680
Still, it's a relief that it's only to this extent.

207
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.980
Quietly look into a kid for me.

208
00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.480
Han Jae Hyeon from the class of '91 in the Department of Law.

209
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:17.510
I think he might be part of the activist group. Look into his family situation as well.

210
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.260
Okay.

211
00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:32.420
Don't worry. I won't get back together with him again.

212

<i>They're saying the dress costs three million  (≈ $3,000).</i>

213
00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.100
You did well.

214
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.080
- Go. 
 - Goodbye.

215
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.990
Bye.

216
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.710
Excuse me, Director.

217
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:06.850
Yes, please speak.

218
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.770
Are there any opportunities for private lessons?

219
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.360
Teacher Yoon, aren't you already doing a lot of private lessons?

220
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.950
I'm in an urgent need for money.

221
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:26.520
I understand your situation, but it's not like I have individual lessons reserved just for you.

222
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.040
Anyway, I'll let you know if there are any reservations coming in.

223
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.590
Thank you. Thank you so much.

The hourly wage is high here.

I'll pay you the exact same.

245
00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:28.240
Your business isn't going well enough, you know it.

246
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.160
Are you not going to play the piano anymore? Can you just use your hands however you please?

247
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.100
These days, rubber gloves are made really well.

248
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.440
Why are you doing part-time jobs like these?

249
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:41.180
I ruined a luxury brand dress while working part time at the hotel.

250
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.170
Then find another hotel to work at.

251
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.960
- I don't want to.
 - Why?

252
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.050
I like using my body. It helps me clear my head.

253
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.210
And it's pathetic too, to strain myself at the hotel or whatever, just to earn 'refined' money.

254
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.920
Because I have to eat brunch with the other mothers at the hotel,

255
00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.020
I even wore that unsightly mask, and my life itself was a masquerade.

256
00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.750
But now I plan on living with my bare face.

257
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.100
Actually, I couldn't say this before,

258
00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.710
but you look much better with your bare face.

259
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.320
Are you being sincere or is that a diss?

260
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.220
Just the truth.

261
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.290
That's upsetting. I did my best to dress up.

262
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:27.540
Do you not have a mirror at home?

263
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.790
You're still single because you act like that.

264
00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.380
Hey, let's go together.

265
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.520
You must be busy, I'm sorry for calling you here like this.

266
00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.770
- It's okay, but why did you call me here? 
 - That is...

267
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.320
We should settle our debt.

268
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:00.540
Yes.

269
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.620
"I'm not going to ask for that money because I'm rich."

270
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:09.390
I don't do that. I learned from a young age that I need to calculate everything clearly.

271
00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.750
I'll pay you back within a week.

272
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.770
Is it over with you paying for the clothes?

273
00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:18.230
Why aren't you compensating for shaking up someone's family?

274
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.610
I know what you or Jae Hyeon will say.

275
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:28.010
That I had an affair first, so shouldn't I stay quiet.

276
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:31.880
Then you guys should only go to the extent that I did.

277
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.350
Throw him away after playing for a bit.

278
00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:42.640
Such that there isn't even a bit of sympathy or lingering feelings left.

279
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:50.330
Then I'll say I received my compensation and call it even.

280
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.980
Just so you know, I have absolutely no refinement.

281
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.760
Grabbing people's hair or anything that can be grabbed,

282
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.390
slapping people, spraying water, I'm good at all those.

283
00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.500
<i>We will now begin the government inspection of the case pertaining to</i>

284
00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.080
Hyeong Seong Group's borrowed-name shares and dismissal of temporary workers.

285
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.630
<i>Every person who has lent their name</i>

286
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.280
<i>has revealed that the real owner of their stocks was you, Vice President Han Jae Hyeon. </i>

287
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.540
<i>Altogether, the total issued shares from borrowed names reaches thirty-five percent.</i> 
 <i>[Hyeong Seong Group's government inspection: rebuke for borrowed-name shares and dismissal of temporary workers]</i>

288
00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:51.960
<i> While even the owner, Chairman Jang San, has only twenty-one percent of the shares under his name. </i>

289
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.240
Permanent workers make up just under 60% of the overall personnel.

290
00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.300
Why would such a large corporation like Hyeong Seong Group do such thing?

291
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.230
I'll look into the specifics a bit more before elaborating.

292
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.220
What exactly is it that you know?

293
00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:08.890
If you don't know anything, why did you come here?

294
00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.000
You should be ashamed of yourself!

295
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.860
And by the way, witness.

296
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:16.550
You used to participate in demonstrations quite diligently when you were a student, right?

297
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:20.840
What's more, I understand you used to partake in labor movements as well.

298
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.690
What a way to turncoat.

299
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.530
You're not going to the festival?

300
00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.600
No, I'm not. <i> 
 May, 1994</i>

301
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.330
Why? I really want to go.

302
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.880
You go.

303
00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.320
Everyone goes with their boyfriends and girlfriends.

304
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.790
There's the subway union strike, and the Uruguay Round as well.

305
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.360
The student council election is also soon, and there's the campaign against the tuition fee, too.

306
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.870
That's a lie.

307
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.010
I'm going through puberty right now.

308
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.300
What?

309
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.540
With my rebelling for no reason and being boisterous,

310
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:03.850
I've been copying what the activists from the 'upper league'  did in the 80's.

311
00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:06.880
And now I feel like I'm playing with politics while pretending to be an adult. So I'm thinking hard these days.

312
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.590
In light of that, there's no reason for me to go play at a festival.

313
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:16.090
When are you going to be able to live feeling at ease?

314
00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.330
Someday, when the world becomes good.

315
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:23.600
I hope the world becomes good quickly.

316
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.300
We have a meeting in the club room. Do you want to go together?

317
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.720
Hundred people from liberal arts, fifty from natural sciences, forty from law.

318
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.970
How many people are on the other side?

319
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.140
We'd only know once Kyeong Ho gets here.

320
00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.860
We can fill all five hundred slots even if they only bring fifty people.

321
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.620
If we can fill rows one and two with forty good runners,

322
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.080
then we have a rough sketch of the formation.

323
00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.180
How can we fight with only five hundred people? The problem just keeps growing as time goes.

324
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.860
Sometimes I wonder if we should be more soft, like the others.

325
00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.360
Revolution. Purge. Destruction.

326
00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:02.230
We use words that are too intense.

327
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.170
Excuse me, our people won't be able to go.

328
00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.580
Why?

329
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.860
There's a sudden test that has been scheduled for the Business Department.

330
00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.290
Dammit. Tell them all to go die.

331
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.710
Why are people who worry about tests joining in protests?

332
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.900
- It's a test that will affect our grades, so— 
 - Is there anyone who doesn't get grades?

333
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:23.970
Do you think I like to dual wield?  
 <i>(T/N: dual wield here means to fail two subjects in a semester.)</i>

334
00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:25.870
Am I a cowboy?

335
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:28.890
In any case, the so-called 'leadership' group is the worst.

336
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:34.140
They're either studying for the TOEIC, or they're busy dating.

337
00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.840
We are slowly losing our power to fight. Maybe because we have a civilian government.

338
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:42.250
I've said this before. Student protests are like riding a bicycle.

339
00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:45.140
You have to continue and consistently pedal

340
00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.430
without any breaks. If you are without power, what do you do? You—

341
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:52.550
Do you want to just keep going only?

342
00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:55.730
- What? 
- Where is that bike going?

343
00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.890
Where is the destination?

344
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.170
Ah, this punk really.

345
00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:06.950
It's because of that calculating and rotten mentality of yours, that our organization is in this state.

346
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:11.470
I know you're trying to get some connections into the political world

347
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.300
because your chances of getting a job have been blown with your horrible grades.

348
00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:18.100
But don't use the innocent kids who tossed aside their books to change the world

349
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.850
to wheel your own bike, Hyung.

350
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.560
Hyeong Seong Group's Chairman Jang San's relative present here,

351
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.290
obtained personal interest by fraud,

352
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:34.620
through numerous means such as the possession of borrowed-name shares

353
00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.330
and the creation of slush funds,

354
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.310
all the while performing deeds such as massive dismissal of temporary workers,

355
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.250
thus displaying ultimate immorality.

356
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.370
- Good work, Sir. 
 - Sure.

357
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.100
A fair amount of people with a borrowed name stock must've replied.

358
00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.040
Saying their shares actually all belonged to Han Jae Hyeon.

359
00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:57.480
Everyone wants to transfer ownership to your name as fast as possible.

360
00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.080
We'll have to make a queue.

361
00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.930
All that's left after changing names will be taxes.

362
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.710
But Seoul Bank said they are still doing the paperwork.

363
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:07.640
I am pecking at them to get them going.

364
00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.980
That aside, the civil case can be taken care of this way,

365
00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:12.900
but what do you plan on doing for the criminal case?

366
00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:14.720
Should I meet with the prosecution in advance?

367
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.200
You don't need to do that.

368
00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.640
Why not?

369
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.200
I've already met them.

370
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:23.910
But, Director Jeong.

371
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.080
Yes, Vice President.

372
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.540
How come nobody knows about my negotiation with the laid-off workers?

373
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.500
Is the PR team on vacation?

374
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.950
I'll look into that right away and take action.

375
00:32:35.050 --> 00:32:37.160
They should've seen everything.

376
00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:52.680
Joon Woo.

377
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:54.160
Yes, Sir!

378
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:57.670
The black car behind us, since when has it been following us?

379
00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.060
I think it has been following us from the parking lot

380
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.180
- Today? 
 - No, Sir. For a few days now.

381
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.740
Joon Woo.

382
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.270
Yes, Sir!

383
00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:23.920
The black car behind us, since when has it been following us?

384
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:28.290
I think it has been following us from the parking lot

385
00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:31.460
- Today? 
 - No, Sir. For a few days now.

386
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:35.650
What about the car itself?

387
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.500
I've been checking every day for location tracking devices.

388
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:50.900
<i>Leslie Chung, Special Showing</i>

389
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.200
Did you mention that you liked movies?

390
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.190
Yes. I like movies a lot.

391
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:07.270
- In that case, shall we go see a movie? 
 - Right now?

392
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:10.780
I know that I am not in any position to see a movie at the moment.

393
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:16.700
I just wonder when next I will find the chance to see a movie.

394
00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.190
I'm all for it, no matter what.

395
00:34:47.530 --> 00:34:52.840
<i>October, 1994</i>

396
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.030
What's with this Hong Kong movie? You can't call that a movie.

397
00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:34.450
- You know that movie with Chow Yun Fat? Much better. 
 - This was a waste of money.

398
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:35.570
So boring.

399
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.440
It's totally boring, how is that a Hong-Kong movie?

400
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.120
Let's go, let's go.

401
00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.140
Shit, let's go!

402
00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:52.660
Wait here a moment.

403
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.360
Your arms must hurt.

404
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:06.290
How did you know to find me here?

405
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.460
I'm sorry but I didn't come because of you.

406
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:12.110
I was on a street campaign and saw the movie poster, so I snuck out.

407
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:17.650
I also wanted to see this movie and I wasn't in the mood for that demonstration.

408
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.390
Ah, so my sneeze was because of the tear-gas.

409
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:23.510
I knew it was you when I heard the sneeze.

410
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.720
Then you should have come to sit beside me.

411
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.160
I didn't want to block those gentlemen's view.

412
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.210
They asked for a refund.

413
00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:33.850
They said they thought it'd be something like <i>A Better Tomorrow.</i>

414
00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:39.960
Leslie Cheung was good in <i>A Better Tomorrow</i> too, but I liked this version of him as well.

415
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.220
I agree. I hope he keeps acting for a long time. Don't you think so?

416
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.870
You know, Sunbae...

417
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:25.800
They say that there are people who always end up meeting again, no matter what happens.

418
00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.060
I think we are exactly like that.

419
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.950
I will soon be home, so don't lock the door. Okay.

The end.

486
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.550
What song is that?

487
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.470
"The boy who counted stars." It's a song by Jeong Won Yeong.

488
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:03.000
How was it?

489
00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:08.510
Are you asleep?

490
00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.380
I think the song is weird.

491
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.670
Why?

492
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:19.930
It keeps making me tear up. What is going on, really?

493
00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.620
Isn't it fun?

494
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.330
Yes. It's really fun.

495
00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:43.400
I want to practice this at home. Is this your guitar?

496
00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.820
No. I borrowed it from the club next door.

497
00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:50.550
Ah really? I should buy one. Come with me and help me pick one out.

498
00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:53.860
I'll buy it for you.

499
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.780
No. It's okay.

500
00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.660
I have money

501
00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.600
When I get paid from my campus part-time job.

502
00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:04.180
How could I accept that?

503
00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.560
I'll buy it for you, so just know that.

504
00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:14.140
Let's do it one more time. Grab it with your fingers like this.

505
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.320
What are you both doing in this sacred club room?

506
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:21.350
I'm learning guitar.

507
00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:26.600
Hey. What does he know about the guitar that you would learn from him?

508
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.160
Ji Soo. Did you see me play the guitar or not?

509
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.110
I did.

510
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.760
You did, right? Am I different from him or not?

511
00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.890
You were in fact different, but...

512
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.900
- Give it here. 
 - What are you doing?

513
00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.580
- Ah, just hand it over. 
 - Come on.

 <i>(T/N:  fixates on one thing only)</i>

I should beat you up for butchering such a good song.

519
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.700
Don't you feel sorry for Yang Hee Eun (the singer)?

524
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:33.120
Wash your hands and feet first.

525
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:34.460
Yes.

526
00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:45.250
How is his mom these days?

527
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.710
She's the same.

528
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:50.600
She should just either completely go under or do something else.

529
00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.400
She has to pick one.

530
00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.380
You're sure she's not seeing another man?

531
00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.390
How could she see a man at her age and in her circumstances?

532
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:01.830
Well, that's true.

533
00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.230
However, she has a pretty appearance.

534
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.500
She definitely must have something going on.

535
00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.910
<i>Mom...</i>

536
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:41.010
<i>By the time you see this letter,</i>

537
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:43.870
<i> I probably won't be a part of this world any longer.</i>

538
00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.900
<i> Every day is just a struggle</i>

539
00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.580
<i>and no matter how I think about it, I can't find the answer.</i>

540
00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:01.350
What's the name of the store you're looking for?

541
00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:03.480
- Hendrix. 
 - Hendrix.

542
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:07.420
But I really can't imagine that you used to play the guitar.

543
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.650
With long hair and doing headbanging.

544
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.080
Wearing leather pants, ripping up the strings with your teeth.

545
00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:15.550
I'm starting to want to rip you apart with my teeth, so just hurry and find the store.

546
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.250
I found it.

547
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.200
Hendrix. It's here.

548
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.210
<i>Hendrix. Guitar specialist.</i>

549
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.440
<i>- Excuse me.
 - Excuse me.</i>

550
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:37.580
<i>Are you looking for Love Letter as well?</i>

551
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.120
Oh, Yeong Min's mom.

552
00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.200
Se Ri's mother.

553
00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.420
Oh my goodness.

554
00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:53.150
So the piano teacher that the director recommended was you.

555
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.120
Come in first.

556
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.900
Okay.

557
00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.050
These days, I find this the easiest. It tastes good too.

558
00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:09.810
It really is tasty.

559
00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:14.020
Right? There's no need to go to a cafe.

560
00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:16.620
Is it Se Ri's younger sibling that's learning the piano?

561
00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:18.320
Yes. He's seven years old right now.

562
00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.240
He went out to buy something out front. He'll be back soon.

563
00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.780
I guess he went with Se Ri?

564
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.900
Se Ri went to Joon Seo's place. Did Yeong Min not go?

565
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.180
Joon Seo's place?

566
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:32.200
Yes, Joon Seo is hosting a party at the hotel, so they called all the kids—

567
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:36.190
Oh my, I guess he forgot.

568
00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:41.390
Joon Seo wouldn't have told Yeong Min. They aren't close.

569
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.350
Is that so?

570
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.570
<i>My son~ What are you doing?? What did you eat for lunch??</i>

571
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:55.080
<i>Ask your dad to buy you a lot of good food.</i> 
 <i>(T/N: the messages show as unread)</i>

572
00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.330
Yeong Min.

573
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:03.150
Should we change schools?

574
00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:08.050
Tell me the truth. What happened?

575
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.730
Nothing happened.

576
00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.860
Then why did you write something like this?

577
00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:16.250
Just because studying is hard.

578
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.080
You had thoughts of dying because of that?

579
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:22.640
It's school violence.

580
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:24.370
No, it's not.

581
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:27.350
If I ask the school, I'll find out everything.

582
00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.790
I'm someone with no patience.

583
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.680
I was the perpetrator.

584
00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:42.260
I'm really sorry.

585
00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.490
- Vice President.
 - Yeah?

586
00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.560
Where are you going to play the guitar?

587
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.850
I'm not telling you.

588
00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:05.520
I want to see too.

589
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.180
What do you want to see? I haven't played in over twenty years.

590
00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.060
Even so, they say that the body remembers this kind of thing.

591
00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:17.600
I guess. I remember too much, and that's the problem.

592
00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.920
Why the guitar?

593
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.340
I'm thinking of playing again.

594
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:30.280
Then you should tell me.

595
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.460
I played guitar pretty well back then.

596
00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:39.290
Hey, if you don't believe me, ask Yoon Ji Soo.

597
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:42.350
I always played for her in the club room.

598
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:46.380
That's right. You played just the one song throughout four years.

599
00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.160
At least I mastered one song,

600
00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.730
with these precious hands.

601
00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:54.560
I do feel sorry to Yang Hee Eun.

602
00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:57.780
If I ever see her in a private setting, I should give her a big apology.

603
00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:00.960
Wow, you do have a conscience.

604
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.870
Anyway, so you're going to pluck some guitar strings?

605
00:54:07.870 --> 00:54:11.520
Can you do that here? We're not in Misari Live Cafe Street here.

606
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:14.320
- Hey, Dong Jin.
 - Hm?

607
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.930
Let me do something cowardly, just for today.

608
00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:21.380
What?

609
00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:28.080

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:09.560
<i>My son. What are you doing?</i>

624
00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.690
<i> What did you eat for lunch?</i>

625
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:15.200
<i>Ask your dad to buy you a lot of good food.</i>

626
00:56:16.450 --> 00:56:22.720
<i>Mom, Dad found out about what happened at school.</i>

627
00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:32.000
What is it?

628
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.190
I have something to give you.

629
00:56:35.790 --> 00:56:38.560
What is the guitar for?

630
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:43.800
I was supposed to buy one for you back then. I suddenly remembered that.

631
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:48.040
You know that I won't accept it.

632
00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:52.700
I know. I know it well, that you won't accept it.

633
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:58.160
But still, this is a promise from the past, so I thought maybe it would be okay for you to accept it.

634
00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.580
But more than that, to be honest...

635
00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:05.000
It's because I wanted to see you.

636
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:29.720
<i>My child and Yeong Min are classmates.</i>

637
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.920
<i>Since his father is here, I'm going to leave.</i>

638

♫ <i>I’ve never lived in a season like yours,</i> ♫

646

♫ <i>this fluttering feeling again</i> ♫

647
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.190
<i>Do you regret it?</i>

648
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:33.130
<i>In the end, I couldn't change anything. I also couldn't protect what was truly important to me.</i>

649
00:58:33.130 --> 00:58:38.240
<i>Sunbae, you should go on your path, and I will go on my own path.</i>

650

<i>They say I committed adultery.</i>

651
00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:45.160
<i>We should make him take responsibility for the things that he did.</i>

652
00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:49.190
<i>I'm not here to threaten you. I'm here to ask for your cooperation.</i>

653
00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:55.960
<i>Either do what you want to do the most or avoid the thing you're most afraid of.</i>

654
00:58:57.830 --> 00:59:02.460
<i>This is the start. It's going to be a long fight.</i>
